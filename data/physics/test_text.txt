misleading sense nothing hawkings actual calculation looks anything like 20,answer question dark matter transparent black perfect blackness understand kaku correctly would something absorbs radiation emit radiation dark matter neither absorbs emits least enough measurable perfect blackness absorb aside since dark matter interacts ordinary matter gravity discovered first place expected emit absorb gravitational radiation weak measurable though question think kaku wrong addition knzhous remarks argue system stable state example hydrogen atom otherwise empty region space quantized energy levels lowest levels ground state system ground state radiate even motion example motion electron atom may idealization real object never completely stable macroscopic object always constituent parts ground

gravity dont yet understand dark matter well enough know else state wise energy wise mean call dark dont mean black sense ordinary black black body objects might low near zero energy photons emitted low frequencies visible spectrum etc dark matter could capable many kinds high energy low energy states fundamental interactions know example unidentified fields interactions also existed interacted

proposed equal well define text mu text well weve proven microseconds equal seconds lesson theres meaningful way perform addition disparate types quantities physics refer general types dimensions examples dimensions length time energy mass etc units specific ways represent dimensions example meters feet units dimension 36,physics independent choice units something like length plus time way

consider units variables instead meters seconds 5x 10y unless arbitrarily assign way youre getting end day still 5x 10y physics uninterested complex numbers end computation need one number 5x 10y two

length time sum meters seconds may length time sum units example text meters text seconds text meters text seconds text meters text minutes ne text meters text minute doesnt make sense think length
