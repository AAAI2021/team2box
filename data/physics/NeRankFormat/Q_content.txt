1 often hear about subatomic particles having property called spin but also that it doesnt actually relate to spinning about an axis like you would think which particles have spin what does spin mean if not an actual spinning motion
2 how would you explain string theory to non physicists such as myself im specially interested on how plausible is it and what is needed to successfully prove it
3 this is question that has been posted at many different forums thought maybe someone here would have better or more conceptual answer than have seen before why do physicists care about representations of lie groups for myself when think about representation that means there is some sort of group acting on vector space what is the vector space that this lie group is acting on or is it that certain things have to be invariant under group action maybe this is dumb question but thought it might be good start to clarify am specifically thinking of the symmetry groups that people think about in relation to the standard model do not care why it might be certain group but more how we see the group acting what is it acting on etc
7 what are the main problems that we need to solve to prove laplaces determinism correct and overcome the uncertainty principle
15 know that theres big controversy between two groups of physicists those who support string theory most of them think and those who oppose it one of the arguments of the second group is that theres no way to disprove the correctness of the string theory so my question is if theres any defined experiment that would disprove string theory
27 weve learned that the wave function of particle collapses when we measure particles location if it is found it becomes more probable to find it again in the same area and if not the probability to finding it in the place that was checked decreases dramatically my question is about the definition of measurement what makes measurement different from any other interaction between two particles gravity and em fields for example in reality almost every particle interacts with any other particle so shouldnt there be constant collapse of the wave function all the time if this happens were right back in classical mechanics arent we
29 person drove miles at mph then drove back the same miles at mph what was their average speed the average of the speeds is frac text mph text mph text mph so the total trip time should be by the definition of average speed frac text mi text mph text hours however this is wrong because the trip actually took hours what did do wrong and what is the correct way to calculate the average speed
31 what is einsteins theory of special relativity in terms lay person can follow
41 there have been recent results in mathematics regarding conformal field theories and topological field theories am curious about the reaction to such results in the physics community so guess starting place for question would be something like did atiyahs axiomatization of tqft capture what physicists feel are important in qfts how many more parameters are there to what physicist would call qft or ft in general perhaps should mention that mathematicians the ones who dont know any phsyics think about various field theories as things that assign invariants to manifolds that should be sensitive to certain data depending on the word proceeding field lot has been done when you only care about the basic topology of the manifold you are evalutating your field theory at have mathematicians gotten rid of too much for physicists to care what types of things do physicists want field theory to keep track of what kind of structure on the manifold that is
62 the lhc in geneva is circular accelerator km long why is it like that
71 in laser resonators higher order modes tem01 etc accumulate phase faster than the fundamental tem00 mode this extra phase is called gouy phase what is an intuitive explanation of this effect gouy predicted and then experimentally verified the existence of this effect long before the existence of lasers how did he do it and what motivated him to think about it
78 can understand why protons will repel each other because theyre both positive but there isnt neutral charge is there so why do neutrons repel do they or have been misinformed the reason why im asking this is because ive just been learning about neutron stars and how the neutrons are forced as in they repel together according to my teacher hes great teacher btw though what just said doesnt make it seem so so wondered why they have to be forced by gravity and not just pushed
79 you can get two photons entangled and send them off in different directions this is what happens in epr experiments is the entanglement then somehow affected if one puts thick slab of em shielding material between the entangled photons have such experiments been made according to epr experiments measurements of the entangled states are at odds with sr so based on that id assume the answer is no dont know but any citations would be appreciated
85 neutron mass proton mass why the discrepancy on related note how does one go about measuring the mass of neutron or proton anyway
89 by newtons law of gravity am referring to the magnitude of the force of gravity is proportional to the product of the mass of the two objects and inversely proportional to their distance squared does this law of attraction still hold under general relativitys tensor equations dont really know enough about mathematics to be able to solve any of einsteins field equations but does newtons basic law of the magnitude of attraction still hold if they are only approximations what causes them to differ
90 im assuming that what ive been told is true we can only detect pulsars if their beams of electromagnetic radiation is directed towards earth that pulsars are the same as neutron stars only that they emit beams of em radiation out of their magnetic poles so isnt it possible that neutron stars emit em radiation in the same fashion as pulsars just not in the right direction for us to detect it
93 coulombs law states that the fall off of the strength of the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the distance squared of the charges gausss law implies that the total flux through surface completely enclosing charge is proportional to the total amount of charge if we imagine two dimensional world of people who knew gausss law they would imagine surface completely enclosing charge as flat circle around the charge integrating the flux they would find that the electrostatic force should be inversely proportional to the distance of the charges if gausss law were true in two dimensional world however if they observed frac fall off this implies two dimensional world is not all there is is this argument correct does the frac fall off imply that there are only three spatial dimensions we live in want to make sure this is right before tell this to my friends and they laugh at me
94 measuring the polarization of laser beam is simple enough task if the polarization is the same everywhere you can even buy commercial polarimeters how do you go about it if the light beam has different polarizations in different parts of the transverse plane one example is radially polarized beam more generally is there good technique for sampling the local polarization which might be linear elliptical or circular anywhere on the poincar sphere in one transverse plane
102 for every force there is an equal force in the opposite direction on another body correct so when the suns gravity acts on earth where is the opposite and equal force also have the same question for centripetal force in planets orbit
111 am looking for book about advanced classical mechanics by advanced mean book considering directly lagrangian and hamiltonian formulation and also providing firm basis in the geometrical consideration related to these to formalism like tangent bundle cotangent bundle form form etc have this book from saletan and jose but would like to go into more details about the symplectic geometrical and mathematical foundations of classical mechanics additional note chapter about relativistic hamiltonian dynamics would be good thing
122 learned today in class that photons and light are quantized also remember that electric charge is quantized as well was thinking about these implications and was wondering if rest mass was similarly quantized that is if we describe certain finite irreducible masses etc then all masses are integer multiples of these irreducible masses or do masses exist along continuum as charge and light were thought to exist on before the discovery of photons and electrons im only referring to invariant rest mass
123 trained as pure mathematician see claims about the mass of galaxy and other such huge measurements that are arrived at experimentally and just have to scratch my head know this is bit of vague question but does anyone have good resource for something like measurement in astrophysics or an introductory history of how astrophysicists figured out how to make measurements of this kind
129 what would be the implications to the standard model if the higgs boson hadnt been found with the lhc also if the higgs boson had not been found with the lhc would it have been successfully proven as non existent or would we just wait for an experiment with higher energy ranges
142 would like to have good understanding of what is happening when you add salt to boiling water my understanding is that the boiling point will be higher thus lengthening the process obtaining boiling water but at the same time the dissolved salt reduce the polarization effect of the water molecules on the heat capacity thus shortening the process is this competition between these two effects real is it something else
147 the answers in this question what is spin as it relates to subatomic particles do not address some particular questions regarding the concept of spin how are some useful ways to imagine particle without dimensions like an electron to spin how are some useful ways to imagine particle with spin to make turn without returning to its original position the wave function transforms as psi rightarrow psi when spin is not classical property of elementary particles is it purely relativistic property purely quantum mechanical property or mixture of both
166 energy production is one of the burning issues for humankind there has been some talk about future energy technologies including fusion anti matter annihilation and zero point energy from most to least plausible im interested in hearing what people know about developments in the field what they think will be the next real breakthrough in energy technologies
185 as understand the higgs boson can be discovered by the lhc because the collisions are done at an energy that is high enough to produce it and because the luminosity will be high enough also but what is needed to claim real discovery guess there is not one event saying hey thats an higgs boson also guess that this was the same kind of situation when the top quark was discovered how does it work edit there is nice introduction to the subject on this page of the cms experiment and the various ways to detect it for example through the following process
197 hope this is the right word to use to me these forces seem kind of fanciful except for general relativity and gravity which have geometric interpretation for example how do two charged particles know that they are to move apart from each other do they communicate with each other somehow through some means ive heard some people tell me that they bounce together messenger photons so does one electron receive messenger photon go oh hey should move in the direction opposite of where this came from due to the data in it and then move arent photons also associated with energy as well does this type of mediation imply that electrons give off energy in order to exert force on other electrons every electron is repelled by every other electron in the universe right how does it know where to send its force mediators does it just know what direction to point it in does it simply send it in all directions in continuum does that mean its always giving off photons energy im just not sure how to view how it is that electrons know they are to move away from each other these questions have always bugged me when studying forces im sure the standard model has something to shed some light on it
202 just came from class on fourier transformations as applied to signal processing and sound it all seems pretty abstract to me so was wondering if there were any physical systems that would behave like fourier transformation that is if given wave purely physical process that would return the fourier transform in some meaningful way like you gave it sound wave and you would see oh there are lot of components of frequency 1khz few of frequency 10khz some of 500hz ive seen things happening where if you put sand on speaker the sand would start to form patterns on the speakers that are related to the dominant wavelengths fundamental frequencies of the sound is this some sort of natural physical fourier transform

236 ive just recently heard of positronium an element with interesting properties formed by an electron and positron and was shocked to hear that physicists were actually working with this element even if for very short lifetime was always under the impression that matter and antimatter annihilated when they came even remotely close to each other which is apparently not the case how do these two particles combine to form an element if theyre oppositely charged and roughly the same mass what kind of interactions could possibly take place before theyre pulled together and annihilated
237 have an approximately basketball sized non hollow piece of aluminum sitting in my house that is of irregular shape need to find the volume of it for very legitimate yet irrelevant reason what is the best way can do this in fact what are all the ways could feasibly do this without going to lab dont live near any labs
239 used to think that the shape of an object determines its ability to float boat shaped objects are more likely to float and spheres tend to sink but my friend who is fond of making me look stupid took me to the local lake showed me sphere that floated and boat shaped object made out of iron that sunk is it based on the mass im not sure that is possible because ive seen really heavy things like airplane carriers float and really light things like my friends iron boat sink what property of certain objects allow them to float if any
270 the straight dope ran an explanation of why nomads often wear black clothing it absorbs heat better from the body on the other hand white clothing reflects sunlight better is it possible to get the best of both worlds and wear clothing that is black on the inside and white on the outside
286 does anyone have an intuitive explanation of why this is the case
290 what aerodynamic effects actually contribute to producing the lift on an airplane know theres common belief that lift comes from the bernoulli effect where air moving over the wings is at reduced pressure because its forced to travel further than air flowing under the wings but also know that this is wrong or at best minor contribution to the actual lift the thing is none of the many sources ive seen that discredit the bernoulli effect explain whats actually going on so im left wondering why do airplanes actually fly is this something that can be explained or summarized at level appropriate for someone who isnt trained in fluid dynamics links to further reading for more detail would also be much appreciated
296 in high school was taught energy was conserved then learned that nuclear reactions allow energy to be converted into mass then also heard that apparently energy can spontaneously appear in quantum mechanics so are there any other caveats with the conservation of energy
304 its bonfire weekend here in the uk and everybody is intent on shooting fireworks was wondering what determines the pitch of the sound produced by an explosion the sound has clearly dominant mid range pitch around few hundred hertz and bigger fireworks also have very low but large component at around hertz what determines this pitch the amount of explosive energy the shape of the vessel something else
312 know classical physics quantum mechanics special relativity and basic nuclear physics would like to get into some particle physics where can find good introduction it might be useful to segment books by whether they require quantum field theory or not
317 quantum mechanics is very successful in determining the overall statistical distribution of many measurements of the same process on the other hand it is completely clueless in determining the outcome of single measurement it can only describe it as having random outcome within the predicted distribution where does this randomness come from has physics given up on the existence of microscopic physical laws by saying that single measurements are not bound to physical law as side note repeating the same measurement over and over with the same apparatus makes the successive measurements non independent statistically speaking there could be hidden stateful mechanism influencing the results has any study of fundamental qm features been performed taking this into account what was the outcome edit since out of questions seem to me not to answer my original question maybe clarification on the question itself will improve the quality of the page the question is about why single measurements have the values they have out of the say measure that make successful qm experiment why do the single measurements happen in that particular order why does the wave function collapse to specific eigenvalue and not another its undeniable that this collapse or projection happens is this random what is the source of this randomness in other words what is the mechanism of choice edit more in particular you can refer to chapter of the road to reality by penrose and with special interest page where the everett interpretation is discussed including why it is if not wrong quite incomplete
335 my question is basically what exactly is electricity ive simply been told before that its flow of electrons but this seems too basic and doesnt show that electricity is instant what mean is turning switch has no delay between that and light coming on is it really instantaneous or is it just so fast that we dont notice it
339 when light rays reflect off boundary between two materials with different indices of refraction lot of the sources ive seen recently dont discuss the relation between the amplitude or equivalently intensity of the transmitted reflected rays and the original ray mostly they just discuss the phase difference induced by the reflection for instance to calculate thin film interference effects is it possible to calculate the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient based on other optical properties of the materials such as the index of refraction or do they need to be looked up from reference table
341 not sure if this is real question but what is the relation between physics and computer science lot of physicists are also computer scientists and vice versa my professor has phd in physics but is computer science professor whats the relation why is this so common
356 how can measure the mass of the earth at home how was the mass of the earth first measured
361 take the following gedankenexperiment in which two astronauts meet each other again and again in perfectly symmetrical setting hyperspherical manifold universe in which the dimensions are curved into the dimension so that they can travel without acceleration in straight opposite directions and yet meet each other time after time on the one hand this situation is perfectly symmetrical even in terms of homotopy and winding number on the other hand the lorentz invariance should break down according to grt so that one frame is preferred but which one so the question is who will be older and why and even if there is one prefered inertial frame the frame of the other astronaut should be identical with respect to all relevant parameters so that both get older at the same rate which again seems to be violation of srt in which the other twin seems to be getting older faster slower how should one find out what the preferred frame is when everything is symmetrical even in terms of grt and if we are back to situation with preferred frame what is the difference to the classical galilean transform dont we get all the problems back that seemed to be solved by rt the speed limit of light because if there was preferred frame you should be allowed to classically add velocities and therefore also get speeds bigger than know srt is only local theory but dont understand why the global preferred frame should not override the local one could anyone please enlighten me please in not too technical way because otherwise wouldnt understand edit because there are still things that are unclear to me posted follow up question here
363 what are some good books for learning general relativity
384 impedance is concept that shows up in any area of physics concerning waves in transmission lines impedance is the ratio of voltage to current in optics index of refraction plays role similar to impedance mechanical impedance is the ratio of force to velocity what is general definition of impedance what are some examples of impedance matching other than in electrical transmission lines
389 from wikipedia the dirac sea is theoretical model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy it was first postulated by the british physicist paul dirac in to explain the anomalous negative energy quantum states predicted by the dirac equation for relativistic electrons the positron the antimatter counterpart of the electron was originally conceived of as hole in the dirac sea well before its experimental discovery in and diracs idea is completely correct in the context of solid state physics where the valence band in solid can be regarded as sea of electrons holes in this sea indeed occur and are extremely important for understanding the effects of semiconductors though they are never referred to as positrons unlike in particle physics there is an underlying positive charge the charge of the ionic lattice that cancels out the electric charge of the sea it always confused me to think of holes as positive charge carriers in semi conductors as not being real real electrons move from one lattice position to another lattice position which effectively looks like positive hole in the lattice that is moving in the other direction but in reality real electron moves the hole is kind of an illusion on the other hand the positrons are always introduced as real hard core particles the quotes from the wikipedia article make me unsure how should look upon these phenomena edit holes in dirac sea give rise to real pos entities in one case and to unreal pos entities in another how can we distinguish is it matter of formalism
391 some sources describe antimatter as just like normal matter but going backwards in time what does that really mean is that good analogy in general and can it be made mathematically precise physically how could something move backwards in time

426 can gamma rays of high enough energy entering our planets atmosphere reach the surface probability or in other words is there window for extremely high energy gamma rays like for the visible spectrum and radio this figure from electromagnetic spectrum shows that the penetration of gamma rays increases with increasing energy but it seems to level out at about km altitude there are no units on the axis and thus it does not show the energy for the highest energy gamma rays for this figure this does not rule out window at even higher energies
427 general relativity tells us that what we perceive as gravity is curvature of space time on the other hand as understand it gravity can be understood as force between objects which are exchanging hypothetical virtual particles called gravitons similar to the way electromagnetic forces are due to objects exchanging virtual photons at least at first glance the two concepts seem mutually exclusive is there description of gravity which includes both or is this contradiction one of the problems in combining gr with quantum mechanics

466 so light travels slower in glass for example than in vacuum what causes light to slow down or how does it slow down if light passes through the medium is it not essentially traveling in the vacuum between the atoms
478 magnetic field strength drops off quickly as the distance from magnet increases is there any way to use electromagnetic fields to create magnetic field at location for example if there are strong electromagnetic fields intersecting at location from many strong transmitters could constructive interference be created which creates local magnetic field the engineering idea is that if you create an array of radio transmitters at strong strength working together could there be interference pattern at point far from the transmitters maybe meters away where the fields produce magnetic field at that location think this could be done as em field is composed of electric field and magnetic field shouldnt there be way to make the magnetic field strong at location in space positive consequence of this would be that magnetic placed at that location meters away could be moved by the field also if the field was alternating rather than steady then electromagnet at that location could be alternating and the force on the electromagnet could provide motive force guess since have never heard of this it cannot be done but then again it was once said that levitating normal magnet could not be done then someone did it with spinning magnet which levitates above another magnet now it is popular toy the reason it works is that the magnet is spinning so that it cannot flip over see spin stabilized magnetic levitation update hi would like to clarify wish to move physical object small magnet at distance not to transmit power to the object thanks update my engineering goal for this is small magnetic spin stabilized being pushed from distant location small spin stabilized magnet pushed from below by some projected magnetic field could potentially overcome the force of gravity imagine thin lightweight spinning disk with magnet in the center if projected magnetic field is pushing it upwards then it would stay stable and could be projected from ground into space this might be done with an array of thousands of transmitters on the ground somewhere in the desert far away from people all transmitters could focus small magnetic field at this magnet alternatively if the magnetic field alternates with frequency then the magnet in the levitated device could also be alternating via electromagnetism it could be powered by an battery or microwave power transmitted to the object this is more or less an engineering problem if there is some basic science which can allow this to be potential reality
535 as wikipedia says the kinetic energy of non rotating object of mass traveling at speed is frac mv why does this not increase linearly with speed why does it take so much more energy to go from mathrm to mathrm than it does to go from mathrm to mathrm my intuition is wrong here please help it out
541 was recently wondering what would happen if the force sliding two surfaces against each other were somehow weaker than kinetic friction but stronger than static friction since the sliding force is greater than the maximum force of static friction mu it seems that the surfaces should slide but on the other hand if the force of kinetic friction is greater than the applied force therell be net force mu acting against the motion suggesting that the surfaces should move opposite to the direction theyre being pushed that doesnt make sense the only logical resolution can think of is that the coefficient of static friction can never be less than the coefficient of kinetic friction am missing something
542 my book uses the argument that the multiplicities of few macrostates in macroscopic object take up an extraordinarily large share of all possible microstates such that even over the entire lifetime of the universe if each microstate had an equal chance of being accessed fluctuations away from equilibrium would never occur my question to this statistical proof is this in the real world is there really an infinitesimal but nonzero chance that macroscopic systems could access some of the more unlikely macrostates heat transfer from cold object to hot object
560 am part time physics enthusiast and seldom wonder about the intergalactic space first it is my perception that allalmost all the objects in the universe are organized in the forms of galaxies or in other words the universe is collection of billions and billions of galaxies which are spaced far apart does anything actually exist in the empty space between galaxies if yes how did it reach there
575 comparing the simples form of the forces of both phenomena the law of newton for gravitation propto frac and the coulomb law for electrostatics propto frac one might think that if one can be extended relativistically to curvature in space time that the other one would lend itself to similar description is this so thanks for any useful thoughts and or suggestions

629 when youre in train and it slows down you experience the push forward from the deceleration which is no surprise since the force one experiences results from good old however the moment the train stops one is apparently pulled backwards but is that real physical effect or just the result from leaning backwards to compensate the deceleration and that force suddenly stopping so far the answers basically agree that there are two spring forces involved for one thing oneself as already guessed by me and for the other the vehicle itself as first suggested in roberts answer also as gerard suggested the release of the brakes and some other friction effects might play role so lets be more precise with the question which effect dominates the wrong pull effect and thus who can reduce it most the traveler the driver the vehicle designer edit lets make this more interesting im setting up bounty of see edit below for devising an experiment to explain this effect or at least prove my explanation right wrong and by the end of this month ill award second bounty of for what subjectively judge to be the best answer describing either an accomplished experiment some video or reproducibility should be included numerical simulation rigorous theoretical description update since like both the suggestions of qh7 and georg decided to put up second bounty of thus reducing the second bounty to however

704 if you read the article more is different by anderson science august you will find deep question are the physical laws dependent of the size of the system under study as an example we can ask ourselves are the description of hundred of atoms more than simply one hundred times the description of one atom alone of course we have interactions but are these interactions dependent of the number of particles implied
721 my question has silly formulation but want to know if there is some sensible physical question buried in it suppose an exact copy of our universe is made but where spatial distances and sizes are twice as large relative to ours would this universe evolve and function just as ours since mass is proportional to volume which is distance cubed but strength of rope is only distance squared think not everything would scale proportionally does this mean that universe with our physical laws that evolves like ours can only have one particular size or would the physical laws scale proportionally so that it evolves in the same way if it has particular size what is it relative to another variation suppose another exact copy of our universe is made but where everything happened twice as fast relative to ours would it evolve in the same way as ours
728 suppose have lumpy hill in first experiment the hill is frictionless and let ball slide down starting from rest watch the path it takes the time independent trail it follows in the next experiment the hill stays the same shape but the ball now rolls without slipping down the hill assume there is no deformation of the ball or of the hill no micro sliding of the contact surface and no other forms of rolling resistance energy is conserved release the ball from rest at same point on the hill track the path the rolling ball takes does the rolling ball follow the same path as the sliding ball but more slowly or does it sometimes follow different path note there may be some trick answers for example if the hill curves significantly on scales similar to the radius of the ball the ball could get wedged in somewhere or two parts of the ball could contact the hill at the same time lets assume that geometrically the shape of the hill is such that it is only possible to have the ball contact the hill at one point and that the ball always contacts the hill at single point it never flies off

814 one of the three classic tests of general relativity is the calculation of the precession of the perihelion of mercurys orbit this precession rate had been precisely measured using data collected since the 1600s and it was later found that newtons theory of gravity predicts value that differs from the observed value that difference which am calling the anomalous precession was estimated to be about arcseconds per century in einsteins time have heard that general relativity predicts an additional correction that is almost exactly sufficient to account for that century difference but ive never seen that calculation done at least not correctly can anyone supply the details

862 am asking this question completely out of curiosity the other day my roommate by mistake used light year as unit of time instead of distance when corrected him pedantic much he said the following units are relative and according to fourier transforms units can be changed so light year is unit of time that got me thinking and read up fourier transforms on wikipedia but couldnt find anything about using unit in one domain as unit for another measurement do agree that units particularly base units are relative eg the meter but does his statement make any sense edit thank you everyone for all the answers it isnt so much to in it in or prove point as it is to understand the concept better anyways this is his response after showed him this thread any comments would be appreciated his response nevermind for the first time accept was wrong but using lightyears to measure time is possible my example didnt make sense bacause was wrong when meantioned that im still measuring dist if you have signal in time domain and take the ft get signal which does not have to be in frequency domain clarify this to the guy who posted last now the new signal is in domain defined by me and so is its units this signal although not equal to the original signal still represents that if ya take an inverse ft so the idea of time will still be there now coming back to our case lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance it represents time

916 problem if you had long bar floating in space what would be the compressive force at the centre of the bar due to the self weight of both ends diagram what is the force at point in the middle of the bar total mass the bar summary you should be able to simplify by cutting the bar into pieces but that gives different answer depending on how many pieces you use see below so the simplification must be wrong but why my approach split bar in two so one approximation would be to cut the bar in half two pieces of length mass bar approximated as blobs and force at is gm1 m2 or fx but is that really valid if so shouldnt you get the same answer if you split the bar into four pieces split bar into four my assumption is that the force at is the sum of the attractions of each blob on the left to every blob on the right force at being force between blobs and fx this is bigger than the previous result vs split bar into six similarly if you split into blobs the total force comes out as fx fx so whats wrong with my approach and what is the real answer so it seems the more pieces we split the bar into the larger the result gets theres clearly something wrong with my assumptions but what id be very glad if someone here could explain this thanks edit as peter shor pointed out my calculations had some dodgy algebra and id calculated values rather than ive now corrected that the value still increases as you divide into more masses ill do bit more work with more divisions and see if this leads to convergence or not

925 an alkali atom has single outer electron that interacts with incoming photons of the right wavelength for alkalies its in the visible ir range if there is an external magnetic field the electron has well defined quantization axis and the the incoming light can be separated into three components linearly polarized and left right handed circular polarized parts the interaction strength between the different atomic energy levels levels described by different quantum numbers and each of the polarization components is relatively straightforward to calculate with the appropriate clebsch gordan coefficients and symbols what is then the situation if there is no external magnetic field to provide the quantization axis is polarization meaningful from the atoms point of view how one sets out to calculate the interaction strength for the different polarizations in the laboratory frame
937 my understanding is that light can not escape from within black hole within the event horizon ive also heard that information cannot propagate faster than the speed of light it would seem to me that the gravitational attraction caused by black hole carries information about the amount of mass within the black hole so how does this information escape looking at it from particle point of view do the gravitons should they exist travel faster than the photons
961 lighter nuclei liberate energy when undergoing fusion heavier nuclei when undergoing fission what is it about the nucleus of an iron atom that makes it so stable alternatively iron has the greatest nuclear binding energy but why
1008 theres more gravitational force in our galaxy and others than can be explained by counting stars made of ordinary matter so why not lots of dark planetary systems without stars made of ordinary matter why must we assume some undiscovered and unexplained form of matter
1039 if you see through small enough aperture you can see things without glasses how does this trick work
1048 suppose in the milliseconds after the big bang the cosmic egg had aquired some large angular momentum as it expanded keeping the momentum constant not external forces the rate of rotation would have slowed down but it would never reach zero what implications would that have to measurments to distant supernova and cmb radiation do we have any experimental data that definitely rules out such as scenario and to what confidence level edit recent article suggests that the universe might indeed be spinning as whole anyone care to poke holes at it edit even more recent article places limits on possible rotation
1060 superconducting wire has no electrical resistance and as such it does not heat up when current passes through it non superconducting wires can be damaged by too much current because they get too hot and melt but since current is the flow of electrons surely unlimited electrons cant flow
1061 am reading brief history of time by stephen hawking and in it he mentions that without compensating for relativity gps devices would be out by miles why is this am not sure which relativity he means as am several chapters ahead now and the question just came to me
1074 wire wire wire and both have resistance so current frac flows through each of the wires how come electrons know which wire path to choose what am thinking is if we consider electrons at point are in state frac rangle rangle sqrt and at the junction some kind of measurement occurs which leaves half of the electrons in state rangle and other half in rangle please explain how exactly this works please point out why argument above is right or wrong or at all relevant in this situation edit how can one derive basic laws for series and parallel ckts from more basic principles thanks
1075 how to get an approximation of avogadro or boltzmann constant through experimental means accessible by an hobbyist
1102 lets imagine the following situation at an initial moment large water drop with diameter for example text cm is placed in deep space say an astronaut is experimenting lets the initial temperature of the drop be moderate and the drop itself is at rest at what will happen with the drop maybe it will decompose into smaller droplets while boiling or maybe it is going to flash freeze and the ice shell is forming or maybe something else
1128 the escape velocity of earth is roughly kms however what if long ladder was built extending out of earths atmosphere and considerably more then if something was to climb up at much less than the escape velocity what would happen when it reached the end and what if the object that climbed the ladder then fired some kind of thruster rocket and was going fast enough so that it orbited the earth it would mean less energy required to get into orbit
1135 have noticed that authors in the literature sometimes divide characteristics of some phenomenon into kinematics and dynamics first encountered this in jacksons book where in section of the third edition he writes on the reflection and refraction of waves at plane interface kinematic properties angle of reflection equals angle of incidence snells law dynamic properties intensities of reflected and refracted radiation phase changes and polarization but this is by no means the only example quick google search reveals dynamic and kinematic viscosity kinematic and dynamic performance fully dynamic and kinematic voronoi diagrams kinematic and reduced dynamic precise orbit determination and many other occurrences of this distinction what is the real distinction between kinematics and dynamics
1143 suppose particle has probability of being at location and probability being at location see double slit experiment according to qm the particle is at both and at the same time so is there force of gravity between the two particle superpositions is there self gravity when wave function reaches over finite distance cannot seem to wrap my head around this is the gravity proportional fraction of the entire mass based on the probabilities how do you combine wavefunction with gauss law of gravity have being trying to think about self gravity for long time now
1165 ordinary matter and antimatter have the same physical properties when it comes to for example spectroscopy hydrogen and antihydrogen atoms produce the same spectroscopy when excited and adsorb the same frequencies the charge does not make difference in the potential regardless if its generated by proton or an antiproton nor in how the positron behaves in this potential being its mass equal to the mass of an electron how can astronomy evaluate if far galaxy is made of matter or antimatter given that from the spectroscopy point of view they behave in the same way in other words how do we know that an asymmetry exists between matter and antimatter in the universe
1193 was reading somewhere about really cheap way of travelling using balloons to get ourselves away from the surface of the earth the idea held that because the earth rotates we should be able to land in different place after some time as we all know this doesnt happen someone said that the reason why this doesnt happen is because the atmosphere air clouds etc also revolves around the earth with the same angular velocity as the earths rotation since we are also part of the atmosphere our position doesnt change relatively well im not convinced with that answer why does the atmosphere rotate along with earth gravitational force is towards the centre of the earth but dont see how its making the atmosphere rotate
1203 could any form of matter teleportation every really happen if so what form would it take some science fiction talks about literally sending the atoms from one location to another others talk of creating duplicate and destroying the original question originally added here update there are couple of comments asking me to specify what mean by teleportation im talking about stuff of star trek taking an object or person and transporting them almost instantly across great distances thousands of kms by breaking them up at the atomic or smaller level transporting those atomic components or the information recipe to recreate and re assembling at the new location
1216 sorry if this question is naive it is just curiosity that have are there theoretical or experimental reasons why gravity should not be an emergent property of nature assume standard model view of the world in the very small is it possible that gravity only applies to systems with scale large enough to encompass very large numbers of particles as an emergent property after all the standard model works very well without gravity general relativity and gravity in general has only been measured at distances on the millimeter scale how could gravity emerge for example it could be that space time only gets curved by systems which have measurable properties or only gets curved by average values in other words that the stress energy tensor has minimum scale by which it varies edit to explain bit better what im thinking of we would not have proper quantum gravity as such no unified theory that contains qm and gr at the same time we could have small possibly semi classical glue theory that only needs to explain how the two theories cross over the conditions and mechanism of wave packet reduction or the other corresponding phenomena in other qm interpretations like universe branching or decoherence or whatnot how this is correlated to curvature how gm phenomena arise at this transition point are there theoretical or experimental reasons why such reasoning is fundamentally incorrect
1220 if two ends of rope are pulled with forces of equal magnitude and opposite direction the tension at the center of the rope must be zero true or false the answer is false chose true though and im not understanding why forces act at the center of mass of the object so if there are two forces of equal and opposite magnitude then they should cancel out resulting in zero tension no
1263 saw this ted talk and am curious as to how the sound is focused on the general level can anyone explain this or does anyone have any good articles
1289 have had question since childhood why do we always get circular waves ripples in water even when we throw irregularly shaped object in it
1292 is there any example of transmission of energy in medium that does not show wave nature
1294 while was in high school learnt the dopplers effect which if remember correctly is the apparent change in the frequency of sound caused due the relative motion between the sound and the observer this phenomenon seems obvious but what would like to know is what use does doppler effect have in real life why is it useful
1302 if you shake soda bottle before opening it and then open it you get the fizz that is the compressed co2 releasing to the atmosphere which is at comparatively low pressure value two questions related why does shaking bottle make the compresses gases un dissolve why cant the gases dissolve back into the liquid
1307 while the speed of light in vacuum is universal constant the speed at which light propagates in other materials mediums may be less than this is obviously suggested by the fact that different materials especially in the case of transparent ones have particular refractive index but surely matter or even photons can be accelerated beyond this speed in medium if so what are the effects
1336 recently read that the earths core rotates faster than the surface well firstly its easier to digest the concept of planetary bodies stars galaxies in rotation and or orbital motion but what makes planets core rotate and in the earths case faster than its surface secondly am aware that the cores rotation is what lends the earth its magnetic field but what keeps it going in the first place
1354 what are the best examples in practical life of an energy entropy competition which favors entropy over energy my initial thought is clogged drain too unlikely for the hair spaghetti to align itself along the pipe but this is probably far from an optimal example curious to see what you got thanks
1361 scattering of light by light does not occur in the solutions of maxwells equations since they are linear and em waves obey superposition but it is prediction of qed the most significant feynman diagrams have closed loop of four electron propagators has scattering of light by light in vacuum ever been observed for photons of any energy if not how close are we to such an experiment
1368 if the velocity is relative quantity will it make inconsistent equations when applying it to the conservation of energy equations for example in the train moving at relative to ground there is an object moving at relative to the frame in the same direction the frame moves observer on the ground calculates the object kinetic energy as frac mv however another observer on the frame calculates the energy as frac mv when each of these equations is plugged into the conservation of energy they will result in distinct results think
1372 lets assume that there is nothing in the universe except earth if the earth rotates on its axis as it does then would we experience the effects of rotational motion like centrifugal force and coriolis force the meaning of my question is is earth rotating relative to space
1386 suppose we now consider lattice of spin say ising model and the phase transition at the critical temperature there are few scaling laws describe the regime around the critical temperature such as correlation length xi xi sim nu where nu is the critical exponent this equation describes the divergence of the correlation length as the temperature approaching however it gives no direct physical picture of the spins near the because we need to compute the summation over each pair of spins to find the correlation so the question is if we really look at the lattice what is the most obvious feature and scaling that we can obverse
1402 it might seem common sense that when we split magnet we get magnets with their own poles but somehow find it hard to accept this fact which now know is stated by the magnetic gausss law vec nabla cdot vec have had this doubt ever since reading about the quantum field theory and know might sound crazy but is it really impossible to separate the poles of magnet is there some proof explanation for an independently existing magnetic monopole
1405 understand that the 2nd law of thermodynamics roughly states that if you have body or gas in chamber that is hot at one end and cold on the other the heat will always flow from the hot to the cold part and to get the opposite effect one has to put energy in from the outside through machine or something now dont understand why this fact cannot be explained just through probabilities of the velocities of the gas molecules say it would seem to me that it is simply very very very unlikely that faster moving molecules all end up in approximately one spot at any time but from all the fuzz about the 2nd law im led to believe that there has to be more behind it than probability so where am wrong why is the second law beyond probability how is the 2nd law tested so that one can rule out simple probability ps havent yet had course on probability theory so my understanding of it is limited
1410 im in classical mechanics class now on our exams most questions are quantitative and in general besides the theory part all physics problems just require you to gather formulas manipulate them little bit by using other formulas and come up with an appropriate value in the question you are given all the information you need for our exams they even give us formula sheet with every formula and equation we can possibly need but even after all this physics remains to be one of the most challenging subject for many students including myself just dont get it it seems like it should be so easy grab formula or two and manipulate it until all the given quantities can fit into these formulas but yet even after all this its not easy to do but it should be sorry if im not making any sense im student and most of you already know this stuff so try thinking as newbie to physics edit although this seems like general study question its actually very specific question im really good student but think ive met my match with physics it seems you just cant memorize things in this class like you can with any other class you really just have to understand it and lately ive just been so discouraged to study since no matter how hard study do really bad on the tricky exams my study routine goes little something like this watch pre lecture video that explains the current chapter and take notes on that do the weekly homework which itself is pretty challenging to study for the exams do bunch of practice problems from previous semester exams that they supply us with literally go over and do old exams one question at time and understand everything perfectly at least think do until the real exam comes around and do absolutely terrible dont know what else to do at this point
1417 dont have any idea of general relativity but intend to learn is it good idea to study general relativity in two dimensions time and single spatial dimension in the begining to get good idea on the subject if it is then please give some references for such treatment
1430 was watching documentary entitled the atom and one of the statements made was that atoms behave differently when we look at them wasnt too sure about the reasoning behind this and im hoping someone could explain how or why this happens im not too knowledgeable about the field of physics but the theory of atoms is rather interesting
1442 assume the time standard clocks and any memories about the time standard are destroyed can we recover the time standard again exactly recovering the time standard again means we can determine the date and time that are exactly the same as the destroyed time standard clocks will show if they are not destroyed
1479 ive watched video from the american national history museum entitled the known universe the video shows continuous animation zooming out from earth to the entire known universe it claims to accurately display every star and galaxy mapped so far at one point in this video minutes it displays this text the galaxies we have mapped so far the empty areas where we have yet to map at this point the shape of the universe is roughly hourglass with earth at its centre im having trouble understanding what this represents and why they shape is hourglass is this simply because we have chosen to map in those directions first is there reason astronomers would choose to map in this pattern or is this something more fundamental about the shape of the universe or is it to do with the speed of light reaching us from these distant galaxies continuing on from the hourglass pattern the cosmic microwave background radiation is represented as sphere and labelled our cosmic horizon in space and time this doesnt help clear anything up if we can map cmb in all directions why have we only mapped galaxies in this hourglass shape
1486 from what remember one of the first steps in finding the equations of motion for an orbiting body is to argue that the bodys motion has to be restricted to plane because the central force has no component perpendicular to the plane defined by the initial position and velocity vectors or equivalently because the direction of the total angular momentum has to be constant since there is no torque this means that you can choose coordinates such that dot phi which makes the third term of this general lagrangian vanish frac dot frac mr dot phi frac mr dot theta sin phi ur for example this is done in this derivation around equation note in this post use the zwillinger convention for spherical coordinates listed on mathworld now could be wrong but think there should be total of three conserved quantities in this problem if use the argument in the previous paragraph to impose coordinate system in which dot phi then can easily identify the energy as the noether invariant corresponding to time translation invariance and the angular momentum as the noether invariant corresponding to rotational invariance around the axis theta to theta epsilon but cant think of third one and suspect that the restriction dot phi by the reasoning of the first paragraph eliminates that third conserved quantity so what if dont use the physical argument from the first paragraph so that im not limited to dot phi from the general lagrangian ive written above if my intuition is right should be able to obtain three conserved quantities from noethers theorem alone of course the energy is one and thats still easy to compute another one should be angular momentum although that no longer corresponds to theta to theta epsilon but to some more complicated transformation so guess my question has two parts prerequisite what is the symmetry transformation that generates angular momentum when dot phi neq main question is there another spatial symmetry that generates another conserved quantity if so what is it do know theres basically no practical value to this question since you can always choose coordinates such that dot phi but im just curious
1493 how efficient is an electric heater my guess greater than possibly even say this because most energy is converted into heat some is converted into light and kinetic energy and possibly other forms of energy anyone other opinions this is not homework am just curious and im having discussion with friend who says an electric heater is horribly inefficient less than
1507 update provided an answer of my own reflecting the things discovered since asked the question but there is still lot to be added id love to hear about other peoples opinions on the solutions and relations among them in particular short intuitive descriptions of the methods used come on the bounty awaits now this might look like question into the history of ising model but actually its about physics in particular want to learn about all the approaches to ising model that have in some way or other relation to onsagers solution also am asking three questions at once but they are all very related so thought its better to put them under one umbrella if you think it would be better to split please let me know when reading articles and listening to lectures one often encounters so called onsagers solution this is obviously very famous first case of complete solution of microscopic system that exhibits phase transition so it is pretty surprising that each time hear about it the derivation is at least ostensibly completely different to be more precise and give some examples the most common approach seems to be through computation of eigenvalues of some transfer matrix there are few approaches through peierls contour model this can then be reformulated in terms of model of cycles on edges and then one can either proceed by cluster expansion or again by some matrix calculations the solutions differ in what type of matrix they use and also whether or not they employ fourier transform now my questions or rather requests are try to give another example of an approach that might be called onsagers solution you can also include variations of the ones already mentioned are all of these approaches really that different argue why or why not some or better yet all of them could happen to be equivalent what approach did onsager actually take in his original paper in other words which of the numerous onsagers solutions is actually the onsagers solution for looked at the paper for bit and am little perplexed on the one hand it looks like it might be related to transfer matrix but on the other hand it talks about quaternion algebras now that might be just quirk of onsagers approach to 4x4 matrices that pop basically in every other solution but ill need some time to understand it so any help is appreciated
1513 have digital watch rated to go underwater to rm when it is underwater it can be read normally up until you reach certain angle then suddenly it becomes almost like mirror reflecting all the light that hits it almost perfectly you cannot read the digits the entire surface becomes reflective ive seen this happen with other waterproof watches too so dont think its unique to mine or the specific model im wondering what causes this my physics teacher was stumped when told him about this were doing lenses and imaging in physics right now think it has something to do with internal refraction havent been able to measure the angle it becomes reflective accurately estimate about degrees near this critical point it can be half and half reflective where only half becomes mirror but its always either reflective or not never in between being reflective and non reflective
1523 am looking for some literature on the ising model but im having hard time doing so all the documentation seem to find is way over my knowledge can you direct me to some documentation on it that can be parsed by my puny undergrad brain if the answer is negative can you explain it right there on the answer form

1544 the widely used approach to nonlinear optics is taylor expansion of the dielectric displacement field mathbf epsilon cdot mathbf mathbf in fourier representation of the polarization mathbf in terms of the dielectric susceptibility mathcal mathbf epsilon cdot mathcal mathbf mathcal mathbf mathbf dots this expansion does not work anymore if the excitation field has components close to the resonance of the medium then one has to take the whole quantum mechanical situation into account by describing light matter interaction by two level hamiltonian but this approach is certainly not the most general one intrinsically nonlinear formulations of electrodynamics so what kind of nonlinear formulations of electrodynamics given in lagrangian formulation are there one known ansatz is the born infeld model as pointed out by raskolnikov there the lagrangian density is given by mathcal cdot left sqrt det mu nu sqrt detg mu nu mu nu right and the theory has some nice features as for example maximum energy density and its relation to gauge fields in string theory but as see it this model is an intrinsically nonlinear model for the free space field itself and not usefull for describing nonlinear matter interaction the same holds for an ansatz of the form mathcal frac mu nu mu nu lambda cdot left mu nu mu nu right proposed by mahzoon and riazi of course describing the system in quantum electrodynamics is intrinsically nonlinear and to my mind way to complicated for macroscopical description for nonlinear optics the question is can we still get nice formulation of the theory say as mean field theory via an effective lagrangian think suitable ansatz could be mathcal frac mu nu mu nu where now accounts for the matter reaction and depends in nonlinear way on mathbf and mathbf say mu nu mu nu alpha beta alpha beta where now is nonlinear function of the field strength and might obey certain symmetries the equation left right remains unknown and depends on the material metric vs approach as pointed out by space cadet one might ask the question why the nonlinearity is not better suited in the metric itself think this is matter of taste my point is that explicitly changing the metric might imply non stationary spacetime in which fourier transformation might not be well defined it might be totally sufficient to treat spacetime as lorentzian manifold also we might need simple spacetime structure later on to explain the material interaction since the polarization mathbf depends on the matter response generally in terms of an integration over the past say mathbf int infty left mathbf right tau tau with beeing some nonlinear response functional related to mu nu alpha beta examples for to illustrate the idea of here are some examples for free space it is given by mu nu alpha beta mu alpha nu beta resulting in the free space lagrangian mathcal frac mu nu alpha beta alpha beta mu nu frac mu nu mu nu the lagrangian of mahzoon and riazi can be reconstructed by mu nu alpha beta left lambda gamma delta gamma delta right cdot mu alpha nu beta one might be able to derive kerr nonlinearity using this lagrangian so is anyone familiar in description of nonlinear optics electrodynamics in terms of gauge field theory or something similar to the thoughts outlined here thank you in advance sincerely robert comments on the first bounty want to thank everyone actively participating in the discussion especially greg graviton marek raskolnikov space cadet and willie wong am enjoying the discussion relating to this question and thankfull for all the nice leads you gave decided to give the bounty to willie since he gave the thread new direction introducing the material manifold to us for now have to reconsider all the ideas and hope can come up with new revision of the question that should be formulated in clearer way as it is at the moment so thank you again for your contributions and feel welcome to share new insights
1557 im in freshmen level physics class now so dont know much but something heard today intrigued me my ta was talking about how at the research facility he worked at they were able to accelerate some certain particle to the speed of light said why not and didnt quite understand his explanation but he said it wasnt possible this confused me since the speed of light is finite number why can we go so close to its speed but not quite edit read all the answers and think im sort of understanding it another silly question though if we are getting this particle to the speed of light by giving it some sort of finite acceleration and increasing it more and more why cant we increase it just little more sorry know this is silly question totally accept the fact we cant reach but im just trying to break it down if weve gotten so close by giving it larger and larger acceleration every time why cant we just supply it with more acceleration and how much of difference is there between the speed of light and the speed of light im not really sure if difference is good word to use but hopefully you get what im asking
1566 which experiments prove atomic theory sub atomic theories atoms have nuclei electrons protons and neutrons that the number of electrons atoms have determines their relationship with other atoms that the atom is the smallest elemental unit of matter that we cant continue to divide atoms into anything smaller and have them retain the characteristics of the parent element that everything is made of atoms these sub theories might spur more thoughts of individual experiments that prove individual sub atomic theories my guess is more was able to be proven after more experiments followed
1572 ive been reading about nanotubes lately and keep seeing the nm notation how does this describe nanotubes structure how do determine which is and which is im familiar with matrix notation referring to rows and columns but couldnt connect it with the nanotube structure which is albeit predictable not quite like row column grid
1599 the internet has changed science drastically not only in terms of distributing knowledge via online encyclopedias as wikipedia and freely available sources of publications as arxiv but also as tool for communication through email and lively discussions in forums newsgroups and communities like stackexchange scientific success nowadays greatly depends on the ability to build up teams with different scientific background and experience to my mind the ideal researcher has to seek for people helping him to tackle parts of his problems in which he is not an expert instead of spending months on something someone else could have been done in days so cant we be this ideal researcher or can community on webpage do research by openly presenting ideas and working them out or is this not possible due to stealing of ideas lacking institutional structures and the like what do you think robert
1601 am graduate student in mathematics who would like to learn some classical mechanics however there is one caveat am not interested in the standard coordinate approach cant help but think of the fields that arise in physics as sections of vector bundles or maybe principal bundles and would love an approach to classical mechanics or what have you that took advantage of this now for the questions is there text book you would recommend that phrases the constructions in classical mechanics via bundles without an appeal to transition functions what are the drawbacks to this approach other than the fact that it makes computations less doable if it does that are there benefits to thinking about things this way ie would it be of benefit to someone attempting to learn this material to do it this way
1663 ive seen videos of people in space on iss who squeeze bottle or something and liquid comes out it then separates into smaller balls why is this surely it should stay pretty much together because on iss theres no gravity from the earth or more precisely it is cancelled by the centrifugal force so the liquid should attract itself
1673 coulomb force in si is frac q1 q2 pi varepsilon while in cgs frac q1 q2 why is it mean doesnt it any make difference in dimension since varepsilon itself has dimention and similarly for magnetic force also
1683 some time ago came across problem which might be of interest to the physics se think the problem sounds like homework problem but think it is not trivial am still thinking about it consider rail tank wagon filled with liquid say water suppose that at some moment nozzle is opened at left side of the tank at the bottom the water jet from the nozzle is directed vertically down question what is the final velocity of the rail tank wagon after emptying simplifications and assumptions rail tracks lie horizontally there is no rolling air friction the speed of the water jet from the nozzle is subject to the torricellis law the horizontal cross section of the tank is constant the water surface inside the tank remains horizontal data given mass of the wagon without water initial mass of the water horizontal cross section of the tank gg cross sectional area of the nozzle rho density of the water horizontal distance from the nozzle to the centre of the mass of the wagon with water gravitational acceleration my thinking at the moment is whether dimensional methods can shed light on way to the solution one thing is obvious if then the wagon will not move at all
1686 im reading nano the essentials by pradeep and came upon this statement in the section explaining the basics of scanning electron microscopy however the equation breaks down when the electron velocity approaches the speed of light as mass increases at such velocities one needs to do relativistic correction to the mass so that it becomes we all know about the famous theory of relativity but couldnt quite grasp the why of its concepts yet this might shed new light on what already know about time slowing down for me if move faster why does the relativistic mass of an object increase when its speed approaches that of light
1690 although doubt somewhat whether this question is really appropriate for this site hope it gets answered anyways guess what im wondering is how does one get to work as theoretical physicist and probably more importantly what do theoretical physicist actually do all day long how are theoretical physicists distinguishable from mathematicians does physicists day look very different from that of mathematician have great interest in physics but im not really much interested in doing experiments would it be advisable to do my bachelor in mathematics and try to get into theoretical physics later on is there real chance of getting into research afterwards not that any kind of answer to this question would ever stop me from trying well hope this question is acceptable think might for example be answered by giving link to blog of working theoretical physicist who gives some insight into his or her everyday life or some kind of an essay on the topic of course any other kind of answer is greatly appreciated thanks in advance kind regards sam edit after several answers thanks lot for all the responses found it very interesting and helpful to to get some input from you guys although the opinions seem to differ bit one can definitely see many overlaps too do still have some time do decide and will definitely look at some books suggested here visit some lectures and try to get feel for what it would be like to do either physics or maths thanks again for your effort
1706 guess the title says it all how could would you experimentally test whether our universe is truly time reversal invariant without relying on the cpt theorem what experiments have been proposed to check this have any of them been performed know that there are indirect tests of time reversal invariance by observing cp violation in the decay to pi for example then if you assume that the necessary conditions for cpt symmetry are satisfied in our universe that means there must be time reversal symmetry violation as well but im curious about ways to test time reversal invariance without relying on cpt basically how could we distinguish between the standard model which predicts violation and some hypothetical other theory that matches current experimental results as well as the sm but in which cpt symmetry does not hold
1775 if temperature makes particles vibrate faster and movement is limited by the speed of light then temperature must be limited as well would assume why there is no limits
1779 am graduate student in experimental physics currently writing up my dissertation and beginning to apply to post doc positions while it is very easy to find out about open positions in my particular sub field via various mailing lists it is more difficult to find out about potentially interesting positions in other sub fields what is good way to identify potentially interesting post doc position openings outside of ones sub field
1801 if space itself is expanding then why would it have any effect on matter separates distant galaxies space is nothing and if nothing becomes bigger nothing its still nothing that shouldnt interact with matter in any way it doesnt have mass energy etc gravity doesnt have cutoff distance afaik so even the most distant galaxies should be attracted to each other gravity force would be very very tiny but it would still dominate nothing from space expansion lets take inertia from big bang into account inertia would be the primary force that moves galaxies away comparing to their tiny gravity and even more tiny if any force of our nothing that is still expanding inbetween wouldnt expansion decelerate if driven mostly by inertia
1822 suppose there are non interacting classical particles in box so their state can be described by the mathbf it mathbf it if the particles are initially at the left of the box they can eventually occupy the whole box according to the newtons law in this case we call the gas expand and this process is irreversible nevertheless newtons laws also have time reversal symmetry so we should be able to construct an initial condition such that particles occupy the whole box not all particles in the left chamber will all move to the left chamber here are the simple questions how to select the initial condition mathbf i0 mathbf i0 if you can solve the set of equation of motion why the gas expansion is irreversible even though you can select the initial condition above
1836 think that something is invisible if its isolated particles are smaller than the wavelength of visible light is this correct why is air invisible what about other gases and fumes which are visible
1876 can you tell me how graph theory comes into physics and the concept of small world graphs inspired to ask from comment from sean tilson in which areas in physics overlap with those of social network theory for the analysis of the graphs best
1888 hydrogen is the lightest element so its cable of lifting the most weight in out atmosphere probably not the best terminology there but you get the picture would hot hydrogen in the same sense as hot air be able to lift even more mass would higher or lower density of hydrogen in ballon lift more if you could have balloon which had nothing in it it was vacuum inside would that lift more than hydrogen balloon basically what are the physics to balloons and lifting really not sure what to tag this so if someone else could thatd be great
1894 coming from mathematical background im trying to get handle on the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics according to feynman if you want to figure out the probability amplitude for particle moving from one point to another you figure out the contribution from every possible path it could take then sum up all the contributions usually when you want to sum up an infinite number of things you do so by putting measure on the space of things from which notion of integration arises however the function space of paths is not just infinite its extremely infinite if the path space has notion of dimension it would be infinite dimensional eg viewed as submanifold of 0t mathbb for any reasonable notion of distance every ball will fail to be compact its hard to see how one could reasonably define measure over space like this lebesgue like measures are certainly out the books ive seen basically forgo defining what anything is and instead present method to do calculations involving zig zag paths and renormalization apparently this gives the right answer experimentally but it seem extremely contrived what if you approximate the paths different way how do you know you will get the same answer is there more rigorous way to define feynman path integrals in terms of function spaces and measures
1907 understand that the moons phases are determined by its position in orbit relative to the sun see full story on the moon the shadow is not cast by the earth common misconception this is actually lunar eclipse but by the moons body itself it would appear that in order for the moon to be new moon it would have to be somewhere between the earth and the sun however it would seem that if we were looking at new moon wed necessarily be looking at the sun as well why then can we sometimes see new moon at night why doesnt it vanish at night for half month every month between its last first quarters
1915 this question is about cosmology and general relativity understand the difference between the universe and the observable universe what am not really clear about is what is meant when read that the universe is infinite does it have infinite mass or is it dishomogeneous how can the universe transition from being finite near the big bang and infinite billion years later or would an infinite universe not necessarily have big bang at all
1949 this is quantitative question the problem is inspired by this event on august an enormous chunk of ice roughly square miles square kilometers in size broke off the petermann glacier along the northwestern coast of greenland the petermann glacier lost about one quarter of its kilometer mile long floating ice shelf said researchers who analyzed the satellite data at the university of delaware question imagine an iceberg that is moving freely in the ocean given that the temperature of the surrounding water is celsius and the temperature celsius is evenly distributed throughout the volume of the iceberg estimate how long does it take the iceberg to melt completely in the ocean we will find the mass of the iceberg from the event description average thickness of the chunc is estimated about for simplify we suppose that the iceberg is spherical during the melting
1957 was taught that something which reflects all the colors of light is white the function of mirror is the same it also reflects all light whats the difference update but what if the white object is purely plain and does not scatter light will it be mirror
1984 read the definition of work as vec cdot vec text work force cdot distance if book is there on the table no work is done as no distance is covered if hold up book in my hand and my arm is stretched if no work is being done where is my energy going
2029 know that its possible to make an object levitate using an electromagnet to hold it up but is it also possible to do this with regular magnets is there special kind of magnet need in order to have one powerful enough to hold an object up im asking because have this idea in mind where want to make decorative item that is levitating an inch or so above its container is the object want to levitate is the container shows the magnetic field that is repelling and from each other achieving the levitation the size of this would be as small as food plate maybe even smaller is barely pound or two in weight is that possible
2032 if the earths gravity exerts net downward gravitational force on all air molecules how come the molecules dont eventually lose their momentum and all settle down how is the atmosphere is still miles thick after billions of years
2041 how is the following classical optics phenomenon explained in quantum electrodynamics reflection and refraction are they simply due to photons being absorbed and re emitted how do we get to snells law for example in that case split by request see the other part of this question here
2045 surely group theory is very handy tool in the problems dealing with symmetry but is there any application for ring theory in physics if not whats this that makes rings not applicable in physics problems
2051 in the standard model of particle physics there are three generations of quarks up down strange charm and top bottom along with three generations of leptons electron muon and tau all of these particles have been observed experimentally and we dont seem to have seen anything new along these lines priori this doesnt eliminate the possibility of fourth generation but the physicists ive spoken to do not think additional generations are likely question what sort of theoretical or experimental reasons do we have for this limitation one reason heard from my officemate is that we havent seen new neutrinos neutrinos seem to be light enough that if another generations neutrino is too heavy to be detected then the corresponding quarks would be massive enough that new physics might interfere with their existence this suggests the question is there general rule relating neutrino masses to quark masses or would an exceptionally heavy neutrino just look bizarre but otherwise be okay with our current state of knowledge another reason ive heard involves the yukawa coupling between quarks and the higgs field apparently if quark masses get much beyond the top quark mass the coupling gets strong enough that qcd fails to accurately describe the resulting theory my wild guess is that this really means perturbative expansions in feynman diagrams dont even pretend to converge but that it may not necessarily eliminate alternative techniques like lattice qcd about which know nothing additional reasons would be greatly appreciated and any words or references the more mathy the better that would help to illuminate the previous paragraphs would be nice
2059 from wikipedia entry on kinetic theory the temperature of an ideal monatomic gas is measure of the average kinetic energy of its atoms now if remove all the particles from the box shown below will the temperature be zero
2072 searched and couldnt find it on the site so here it is quoted to the letter on this infinite grid of ideal one ohm resistors whats the equivalent resistance between the two marked nodes with link to the source im not really sure if there is an answer for this question however given my lack of expertise with basic electronics it could even be an easy one
2095 while ago someone proposed the following thought experiment to me horse attached to cart is resting on horizontal road if the horse attempts to move by pulling the cart according to the 3rd newtons law the cart will exert force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction cancelling each other out and thus the horse and the cart should not move and yet it moves pun intended why never got satisfactory answer my guess is that the answer lies in the frames of reference involved horse cart and horse road any ideas
2111 to suck water through straw you create partial vacuum in your lungs water rises through the straw until the pressure in the straw at the water level equals atmospheric pressure this corresponds to drinking water through straw about ten meters long at maximum by taping several straws together friend and drank through 07m straw think we may have had some leaking preventing us going higher also we were about to empty the red cup into the straw completely my question is about what would happen if superman were to drink through straw by creating complete vacuum in the straw the water would rise to ten meters in the steady state but if he created the vacuum suddenly would the waters inertia carry it higher what would the motion of water up the straw be what is the highest height he could drink from ignore thermodynamic effects like evaporation and assume the straw is stationary relative to the water and that there is no friction
2131 dark energy is introduced as constant inside einsteins equations its primary purpose from what understand is to make einsteins equations compatible with the accelerating expansion of the universe as consequence of the predictions of dark energy is the expansion of the universe according to hubbles law know there are numerous experiments that verify this expansion and its acceleration and thus indirectly support the dark energy theory my question is are there other factors that give credit to the existence of dark energy are there any experiments that support this theory but not only through the verification of hubble expansion
2152 laser beams are said to have high spatial coherence this means that the beam is highly concentrated even at long distances low spread can this be achieved with radio waves much longer waves or is it due to lasers stimulated emission
2166 read somewhere that according to relativity it is possible involving black holes and other stuff to jump into the past is it possible for anything to go back in time either continuously or by jumping
2175 is it possible for information like and 0s to be transmitted faster than light for instance take rigid pole of several au in length now say you have person on each end and one of them starts pulling and pushing on his her end the person on the opposite end should receive the pushes and pulls instantaneously as no particle is making the full journey would this actually work
2178 as understand it and admittedly its weak grasp computer processes information irreversibly and gates for example and therefore has some minimum entropy increase associated with its computations the true entropy increase is much greater and comes from the conversion of electrical energy to heat how efficient is typical desktop computer when viewed in this light make any assumptions you find useful about the energy use computations per second temperature of the room etc
2187 how does the optical zoom works does it brings the light closer to the object or does it just enlarges the picture of the object in other words suppose have telescope with light year zoom capacity could see stars year ahead of its light reaching earth ps im not physics graduate but interested in physics joined here to learn more please excuse me if my question is trivial or stupid
2206 what ever happened to action at distance in entangled quantum states the einstein rosen podolsky epr paradox thought they argued that in principle one could communicate faster than speed of light with entangled separated states when one wave function gets collapsed imagine this paradox has been resolved but dont know the reference
2228 heard somewhere that quarks have property called colour what does this mean
2229 as an explanation of why large gravitational field such as black hole can bend light have heard that light has momentum this is given as solution to the problem of only massive objects being affected by gravity however momentum is the product of mass and velocity so by this definition massless photons cannot have momentum how can photons have momentum how is this momentum defined equations
2239 ive noticed that an airplane appears to have more lift when its almost touching the ground then it has feet or more in the air what causes this to occur
2254 take glass of water and piece of toilet paper if you keep the paper vertical and touch the surface of the water with the tip of the paper you can see the water being absorbed and climbing up the paper this climbing up is intriguing me where is the energy coming from supposedly lot of water molecules are moving up and gaining potential energy this has to be balanced by something can think of few possibilities but cant tell which one it is when the water molecules dilute into the paper they are at state of lower potential binding energy some molecular interaction van der waals is at lower energy when you have water paper solution compared to water only solution this compensates the gain in gravitational energy the surface between the paper and the water is at lower pressure than the atmosphere this causes the water to be pushed into the paper by the atmospheric pressure up until the point that the column of water above the surface is heavy enough to counterbalance the potential energy would be result of work done by the atmosphere some water molecules climb up randomly and loose kinetic energy going up and somehow get stuck up there something else
2269 we are taught that the universe began as singularity an infinitely small and infinitely dense point at the beginning of time there was big bang or more accurately inflation the main evidence for this is the observation of the red shift of all of the galaxies this shows us that as time increases the universe becomes bigger logical outcome of this is that going back in time the universe shrinks this is then extrapolated back to the beginning of time where the universe was infinitely small however the only thing that can see that we know for sure is that the universe used to be smaller this does not necessarily imply that it used to be infinitely small how do we know for example that the universe doesnt oscillate and that we are in time where the universe is expanding and accelerating and will eventually contract again what other evidence is there that suggests we started from an singularity
2328 while looking at some exercises in my physics textbook came across the following problem which thought was quite interesting it is possible for the electron beam in television picture tube to move across the screen at speed faster than the speed of light why does this not contradict special relativity suspect that its because the television is in air and light in air travels slower than light in vacuum so suppose theyre saying the the electron could travel faster in air than the speed of light in air like what causes cherenkov radiation
2347 inspired by similar post wanted to know what video games past or present most accurately employ the laws of physics believe this is an appropriate question for this site since the users are far more qualified to answer it than anyone on typical gaming sites who think they know lot more about physics than they really do in my limited experience most games claiming realistic physics are anything but
2355 does time stretch all the way back for infinity or was there point when time appears to start in the universe remember reading long ago somewhere that according to one theory time began shortly before the creation of the universe does time have starting point of note

2398 for an experiment will hopefully be soon conducting at johns hopkins need two different lenses the first needs to allow all wavelengths above nm to pass thus high pass filter and cut off everything else the second needs to allow all wavelengths below nm to pass thus low pass filter and cut off everything else my knowledge of optics is middling know that good old glass cuts of uv light but was hoping for something more specific does anyone know of the theory necessary to tune materials to make such filters truth be told im an experimentalist so simply giving me retail source that has such lenses would get me to where need to go but learning the theory would be nice as well thanks sam
2409 type superconductor can expel almost all magnetic flux below some critical value from its interior when superconducting light as we know is an electromagnetic wave so what would happen if we shine light deep into type superconductor suppose the magnetic field of the light is significantly lower than and what about type ii superconductors
2415 from my understanding objects do not fall but are pulled to the earth from gravity with this in mind cant understand why if helium filled balloons are not pulled by gravity then shouldnt they be stationary in the sky or drift like objects in space with no gravity rather than actively move away from the earth is gravity pushing it rather than pulling it why is this
2425 in its simplest form equivalence principle states that the inertial mass and the gravitational mass should be the same this is easy to understand but why is it so important to the formulation of general relativity to be more specific dont understand how the gravitational field equation can be derived from this principle
2430 ive always heard that watering plants if the temperature goes few degrees below freezing will help prevent them from freezing but ive never quite understood the physics behind it can you guys help me to understand this bit better thanks
2447 regarding general relativity what is the physical meaning of the christoffel symbol gamma jk what are the preferably physical differences between the riemann curvature tensor jkl ricci tensor ij and ricci scalar for example why do the einstein equations include the ricci tensor and scalar but not the riemann tensor to be clear by physical meaning mean something like what physical effect do these components generate or they make the gr solutions deviate from newton because of xxx factor or something similarly physically intuitive

2501 except for mercury the planets in the solar system have very small eccentricities is this property special to the solar system wikipedia states most exoplanets with orbital periods of days or less have near circular orbits of very low eccentricity that is believed to be due to tidal circularization an effect in which the gravitational interaction between two bodies gradually reduces their orbital eccentricity by contrast most known exoplanets with longer orbital periods have quite eccentric orbits as of july of such exoplanets have eccentricities greater than while have eccentricities greater than this is not an observational selection effect since planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its orbit the prevalence of elliptical orbits is major puzzle since current theories of planetary formation strongly suggest planets should form with circular that is non eccentric orbits what is special about the solar system that orbits of planets here are nearly circular but elsewhere they are moderately or highly eccentric
2554 read lot about the classical twin paradox recently what confuses me is that some authors claim that it can be resolved within srt others say that you need grt now what is true and why
2596 shortly after the invention of quantum electrodynamics one discovered that the theory had some very bad properties it took twenty years to discover that certain infinities could be overcome by process called renormalization one might state the physical reason behind this that we are only aware of effective theories which are reliable on certain scales given by more or less fundamental constants renormalization tells us how to deal with this situation and only consider effects of specific range the technique to perform the calculations is called renormalization group it is powerful tool and it is no wonder it is under heavy development since nothing can be calculated without it in quantum field theories per se this procedure is not limited to its root and one might ask the question how can we use the renormalization group to find effective theories for classical field theories suppose an example where this has been done very recently can be found in renormalization group analysis of turbulent hydrodynamics would be thankful for any insight examples etc sincerely robert ps the question is naturally linked to how to calculate the properties of photon quasiparticles and in loose line with pedestrian explanation of conformal blocks since am no expert in the field please advice me if something is not clear or simply wrong
2597 understand that energy conservation is not rule in general relativity but id like to know under what circumstances it can still be possible in other words when is it possible to associate potential energy to the gravitational field so that the energy is constant in the evolution of the system here are some examples is there convenient way to define energy in these scenarios just system of gravitational waves point mass moving in static but otherwise arbitrary space time equivalent if im not mistaken to test mass moving in the field of second much larger mass the larger mass wouldnt move two rotating bodies of similar mass overall im trying to understand what keeps us from associating potential energy to the metric when we break the time translation symmetry of system by introducing an electromagnetic field we can still conserve energy by defining an electromagnetic potential energy why cant we do the same when we break tt symmetry by making space time curved
2615 having read the wikipedia page on superfluids im still not sure if stuff like liquid helium at the lambda point actually have surface tension or not is superfluidity the same thing and are there any liquids with no surface tension at room temperature
2625 what is the difference between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
2630 so remember in college physics the prof using liquid nitrogen in demonstration when he was done he threw the container of ln at the front row and of course it evaporated or whatever before it got to the students am watching cooking show now and they are using ln if they touched that what would happen would it be possible for the chefs to pour the ln onto their skin accidentally or would it evaporate before it reached their skin
2644 ive always assumed been told that newtons 2nd law is an empirical law it must be discovered by experiment if this is the case what experiments did newton do to discover this is it related to his studies of the motion of the moon and earth was he able to analyze this data to see that the masses were inversely related to the acceleration if we assume that the force the moon on the earth is equal to the force the earth exerts on the moon according to wikipedia the principia reads lex ii mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur translated as law ii the alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressd and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressd my question is how did newton come to this conclusion get that he knew from galileo galilei the idea of inertia but this doesnt instantly tell us that the change in momentum must be proportional to the net force did newton just assume this or was there some experiment he performed to tell him this
2658 im doing magnification and lens in class currently and really dont get why virtual and real images are called what they are virtual image occurs the object is less than the focal length of the lens from the lens and real image occurs when an object is further than focal length by why virtual and real whats the difference you cant touch an image no matter what its called because its just light
2670 consider that we have system described by wavefunction psix we then make an exact copy of the system and anything associated with it including the inner cogs and gears of the elementary paticles if any aswell as the fabric of spacetime but where all distances are multiplied by number so psix to psikx we consider the case if this is just the parity operation so for from the little read about this we could express it as product of and transformations consider then that all observables associated with the new system are identical to the original we find that that the laws of the universe are invariant to scale transformation to kx according to noethers theorem then there will be conserved quantity associated with this symmetry my question is what would this conserved quantity be edit an incomplete discussion regarding the existence of this symmetry is mentioned here what if the size of the universe doubled edit2 like the answers but am missing the answer for nrqm
2672 why when we calculate the total cross section we make the average other initial states and the sum over final states
2690 according to noethers theorem all conservation laws originate from invariance of system to shifts in certain space for example conservation of energy stems from invariance to time translation what kind of symmetry creates the conservation of mass
2721 another noethers theorem question this time about electrical charge according to noethers theorem all conservation laws originate from invariance of system to shifts in certain space for example conservation of energy stems from invariance to time translation what kind of symmetry creates the conservation of electrical charge
2725 have read that the fine structure constant may well not be constant now if this were to be true what would be the effect of higher or lower value and why
2743 this question appeared quite time ago and was inspired of course by all the fuss around lhc will destroy the earth consider small black hole that is somehow got inside the earth under small mean small enough to not to destroy earth instantaneously but large enough to not to evaporate due to the hawking radiation need this because want the black hole to consume the earth think reasonable values for the mass would be kilograms also let us suppose that the black hole is at rest relative to the earth the question is how can one estimate the speed at which the matter would be consumed by the black hole in this circumstances
2767 electromagnetic waves can be shielded by perfect conductor what about gravitational fields or waves
2824 when my wife uses her laptop if touch her skin can feel buzz she doesnt feel the buzz but she can hear it if touch her ear so im guessing its faulty laptop and shes conducting an electrical current but why would she not feel anything and what would it be that she would be hearing when touch her ear more info the effect is only intermitent its pretty reliable in single session on the laptop but some sessions it wont happen and others it will had the same sensation with desk lamp that had several years ago with no moving parts as far as could tell the effect only occurs when move my finger if im stationary dont notice anything was playing with my son and noticed the same buzz first thought he was touching the laptop then realised he had skin to skin contact with my wife who was using the laptop
2900 why gps glonass galileo satellites are on low earth orbit why geostationary orbit is so bad sattelites might be placed there statically and more precise the only problem can see is navigation close to poles but they have this problem anyway
2916 what is the exact shape of the universe know of the balloon analogy and the bread with raisins in it these clarify some points like how the universe can have no centre and how it can expand equally everywhere in all directions but they also raise some questions like if you are on the surface of balloon and travel in direction you will eventually return to your starting point is it possible our universe have this feature if it has or had would this be symmetry of sorts psix psix and as such have conserved quantity associated with it by noether assuming small curled up dimensions wouldnt these dimensions have this type of symmetry what are the associated conserved quantities is it known exactly what the geometrical shape of the universe is on large scale am not talking about only the observable universe how does one define the size of dimension is this scale only applicable to curled up ones is it possible to describe to layman the shape of the universe without resorting to inept analogies
2928 so if you have light bulb in room and you had tool to measure the amount of light thats in the room then lets assume the amount of light only caused by the bulb is if you place mirror next to the bulb does the amount of light in the room in crease to can you keep going so that the light in the room in creases to etc with more mirrors how far can you take this also is it actually adding light to the room or is it simply causing the same photons to move faster reflecting from one mirror to the next making it seem like there is more light in the room but there really isnt made me think so thought ask here
2964 theres something known as resonating valence bond rvb state which plays role in at least some attempts to understand physics of high superconductors this roughly involves state thats in superposition hence the resonating part of the name if understand correctly of different ways to pair electrons into strongly bonded spin singlets my question is what is more precise definition of this sort of state whats the underlying physics when does it arise and why is it interesting points an answer might address is there simple toy model for which this is the ground state that sheds light on what sort of system it could arise in is there an interesting continuum limit in which we can characterize this state in more field theoretic language are there particular kinds of instabilities such state tends to be subject to think know where would start digging if wanted to really understand this for myself but mostly im asking it to probe the community and see what kind of expertise might be lurking here since there havent been so many condensed matter questions
3009 understand that people explain in laymans terms at least that the presence of mass warps space time geometry and this causes gravity have also of course heard the analogy of blanket or trampoline bending under an object which causes other objects to come together but always thought this was hopelessly circular explanation because the blanket only bends because of real gravity pulling the object down and then pulling the other objects down the sloped blanket in other words to me it seems that curved space wouldnt have any actual effect on objects unless theres already another force present so how is curved space time itself actually capable of exerting force without some source of fourth dimensional force apologize for my ignorance in advance and purely mathematical explanation will probably go over my head but if its required ill do my best to understand
3014 the simplistic undergrad explanation aside ive never really understood what energy really is ive been told that its something when converted from one kind of something to another kind or does some work as defined by us but what is that something moreover if the total amount of energy in the universe is finite and we cannot create energy then where did it come from ive learned from thermodynamics where it goes but where does it come from know this sounds like something trivially simple but there is so much going on in the physical universe and just cant grasp what it is maybe it is because lack the mathematical understanding that cant grasp the subtle things the universe is doing still want to understand what it is doing how do get to the point of understanding what its doing note what prompted me to ask this was this answer im afraid that it just puzzled me further and sat there staring at the screen for good minutes
3038 just assume that understand that field in quantum field theory is an operator valued distribution for simplicity forget about the distribution and think about function varphi rightarrow lh that assigns an operator to each point of spacetime can someone explain to me what mathematically speaking physicists mean by quanta of this field edit follow up question if one fixes an inertial system and point in time say 00pm then there is space and map dagger mathbb rightarrow lh rightarrow xyz mapsto daggert 0xyz mapsto daggert 0xyz which creates quanta would it be correct to think about particles at the point xyz then one thinks about this map
3081 updated in order to fold anything in half it must be pi times longer than its thickness and that depending on how something is folded the amount its length decreases with each fold differs britney gallivan the person who determined that the maximum number of times paper or other finite thickness materials can be folded mathematics of paper folding explains the mathematical aspect of this would like to know the physical explanation of this why is it not possible to fold paper more than times
3158 from everything ive read about quantum mechanics and quantum entanglement phenomena its not obvious to me why quantum entanglement is considered to be an active link that is its stated every time that measurement of one particle affects the other in my head there is less magic explanation the entangling measurement affects both particles in way which makes their states identical though unknown in this case measuring one particle will reveal information about state of the other but without magical instant modification of remote entangled particle obviously im not the only one who had this idea what are the problems associated with this view and why is the magic view preferred
3168 while this concept is widely used in physics it is really puzzling at least for beginners that you just have to multiply two functions or the function by itself at different values of the parameter and then average over the domain of the function keeping the difference between those parameters cx langle fx xgx rangle is there any relatively simple illustrative examples that gives one the intuition about correlation functions in physics
3182 we learn that the quantum wave function psi collapses when it interacts with classic object measurement my question is why are there classic objects after all how did it all start in quantum universe and understand we live in one there should only be superposition how did these classic beings came into existence which decohere the others in the first place is it statistical necessity like entropy or doesnt quite simply anybody know the answer to that riddle
3264 why is it that thermal radiation of black body usually described by spectral distribution function rather than an intensity vs frequency curve have vague explanation for this any measured intensity of radiation will contain spectrum of frequencies which are impossible to separate even with very good spectrometer one can only measure the intensity of an interval so it is practically impossible to assign particular intensity to particular frequency is my reasoning correct
3282 there are number of physical systems with phases described by topologically protected invariants fractional quantum hall topological insulators but what are the simplest mathematical models that exhibit topological phases is the toric code as simple as we can go edit just to be clear im talking about phases meaning states of matter and not just the geometric phase that wavefunction will pick up under parallel transport in nontrivial configuration space im looking for simple models where one can make phase diagram and as function of the available couplings there is change in some topological property of the system for example in the xy magnet neglecting bound vortex antivortex pair formation there is an instability at finite temperature to creation single vortex which is topologically distinct from the vortex free state
3315 this is intended to be fun question calorimetry used for calculating the heat generated from chemical changes has been around for centuries however suspect the process for calculating food calories is much more complicated can anybody provide clear succinct knowledgable answer although will accept answers with links an independent answer would be preferred
3333 we know that spin is described with su2 and that su2 is double cover of the rotation group so3 this suggests simple thought experiment to be described below the question then is in three parts is this thought experiment theoretically sound can it be conducted experimentally if so what has been the result the experiment is to take slab of material in which there are spin objects electrons all or most with spin uparrow then rotate that object degrees around an axis perpendicular to the spin direction so that macroscopically we are back to where we started measure the electron spins do they point downarrow

3436 im big fan of the podcast astronomy cast and while back was listening to episode they did listener sent in question that found fascinating and have been wondering about ever since from the show transcript arunus gidgowdusk from lithuania asks if you took one kilogram mass and accelerated it close to the speed of light would it form into black hole would it stay black hole if you then decreased the speed dr gay an astrophysicist and one of the hosts explained that shed asked number of her colleagues and that none of them could provide satisfactory answer asked her more recently on facebook if anyone had come forward with one and she said they had not so thought maybe this would be good place to ask
3468 some speculation here http www youtube com watchv nmqpt6okj8 is there possibility it would pass undetected through your hand or is it certain death can you conclude it to be vital or only loose your hand would it simply make small cylindrical hole through your hand or is there some sort of explosion effect assume your hand has cross section of 50cm and thickness of 2cm how much of the beams energy would be transferred to your hand
3495 consider standard quantum mechanics but forget about the collapse of the wavefunction instead use decoherence through interaction with the environment to bring the evolving quantum state into an eigenstate rspt arbitrarily close by question can this theory be fundamentally deterministic if one takes into account that the variables of the environment are not known then the evolution is of course undetermined in probabilistic sense but that isnt the question question is if fundamentally quantum mechanics with environmentally induced decoherence can be deterministic note that im not saying it has to be might be mistaken but it seems to me decoherence could be followed by an actual non deterministic process still so the decoherence alone doesnt settle the question of determinism or non determinism question is if one still needs non deterministic ingredient update please note that asked whether the evolution can fundamentally be deterministic or whether it has to be non deterministic it is clear to me that for all practical purposes it will appear non deterministic note also that my question does not refer to the prepared state after tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom but to the full evolution of system and environment does one need non deterministic ingredient to reproduce quantum mechanics or can it with the help of decoherence be only apparently non deterministic yet fundamentally deterministic

3534 the common understanding is that setting air resistance aside all objects dropped to earth fall at the same rate this is often demonstrated through the thought experiment of cutting large object in half the halves clearly cant then fall more slowly just by being sliced in two however believe the answer is that when two objects fall together attached or not they do fall faster than an object of less mass alone does this is because not only does the earth accelerate the objects toward itself but the objects also accelerate the earth toward themselves considering the formula text frac given ma thus we note that the mass of the small object doesnt seem to matter as when calculating acceleration the force is divided by the term its mass however this overlooks that the force is actually applied to both objects not just to the smaller one the acceleration on the second larger object is found by dividing in turn by the larger objects mass the two objects acceleration vectors are exactly opposite so closing acceleration is the sum of the two text closing frac frac since the earth is extremely massive compared to everyday objects the acceleration imparted on the object by the earth will radically dominate the equation as the earth is sim times mathrm kg falling object of mathrm kg just over pounds would accelerate the earth about frac as much which is one part in trillion trillion of course in everyday situations we can for all practical purposes treat objects as falling at the same rate because of this negligible difference which our instruments probably couldnt even detect but im hoping not for discussion of practicality or whats measurable or observable but what we think is actually happening am right or wrong what really clinched this for me was considering dropping small moon massed object close to the earth and small earth massed object close to the moon this made me realize that falling isnt one object moving toward some fixed frame of reference but that the earth is just another object and thus falling consists of multiple objects mutually attracting in space
3612 this is rather technical question for experts in general relativity an accessible link would be an accepable answer although any additional discussion is welcome gr has well known solutions relating to single black holes schwarzchild rotating rotating with charge these solutions demonstrate some non trivial gr behaviour however do there exist any corresponding binary star black hole solutions because of the non linearity of gr such solution could well demonstrate additional properties to solution that simply consisted of pair of distant schwarzchild solutions glued together
3618 as an exercise sat down and derived the magnetic field produced by moving charges for few contrived situations started out with coulombs law and special relativity for example derived the magnetic field produced by current in an infinite wire its relativistic effect in the frame of test charge the electron density increases or decreases relative to the proton density in the wire due to relativistic length contraction depending on the test charges movement the net effect is frame dependent coulomb field whose effect on test charge is exactly equivalent to that of magnetic field according to the biot savart law my question is can maxwells equations be derived using only coulombs law and special relativity if so and the field is in all cases purely relativistic effect then maxwells equations can be re written without reference to field does this still leave room for magnetic monopoles
3645 can someone give simple expose on coleman mandula theorem and what mandelstam variables are coleman mandula is often cited as being the key theorem that leads us to consider supersymmetry for unification an overview discussion with sufficient detail is missing in many popular texts so how does coleman mandula theorem actually meet its no go claim
3718 below is attached for reference but the question is simply about whether vectors used in physics in vector space can be represented by complex numbers and whether they can be divided in abstract algebra field is an algebraic structure with notions of addition subtraction multiplication and division satisfying certain axioms the most commonly used fields are the field of real numbers the field of complex numbers and the field of rational numbers but there are also finite fields fields of functions various algebraic number fields adic fields and so forth any field may be used as the scalars for vector space which is the standard general context for linear algebra the theory of field extensions including galois theory involves the roots of polynomials with coefficients in field among other results this theory leads to impossibility proofs for the classical problems of angle trisection and squaring the circle with compass and straightedge as well as proof of the abel ruffini theorem on the algebraic insolubility of quintic equations in modern mathematics the theory of fields or field theory plays an essential role in number theory and algebraic geometry in mathematics and physics scalar field associates scalar value to every point in space the scalar may either be mathematical number or physical quantity scalar fields are required to be coordinate independent meaning that any two observers using the same units will agree on the value of the scalar field at the same point in space or spacetime examples used in physics include the temperature distribution throughout space the pressure distribution in fluid and spin zero quantum fields such as the higgs field these fields are the subject of scalar field theory in mathematics an algebra over field is vector space equipped with bilinear vector product that is to say it is an algebraic structure consisting of vector space together with an operation usually called multiplication that combines any two vectors to form third vector to qualify as an algebra this multiplication must satisfy certain compatibility axioms with the given vector space structure such as distributivity in other words an algebra over field is set together with operations of multiplication addition and scalar multiplication by elements of the field vector space is mathematical structure formed by collection of vectors objects that may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers called scalars in this context scalars are often taken to be real numbers but one may also consider vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers rational numbers or even more general fields instead the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication have to satisfy certain requirements called axioms an example of vector space is that of euclidean vectors which are often used to represent physical quantities such as forces any two forces of the same type can be added to yield third and the multiplication of force vector by real factor is another force vector in the same vein but in more geometric parlance vectors representing displacements in the plane or in three dimensional space also form vector spaces in classical mechanics as in physics the field is not real but merely model describing the effects of gravity the field can be determined using newtons law of universal gravitation determined in this way the gravitational field around single particle is vector field consisting at every point of vector pointing directly towards the particle the magnitude of the field at every point is calculated applying the universal law and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space the field around multiple particles is merely the vector sum of the fields around each individual particle an object in such field will experience force that equals the vector sum of the forces it would feel in these individual fields because the force field is conservative there is scalar potential energy per unit mass at each point in space associated with the force fields this is called gravitational potential gauss law for gravity is mathematically equivalent to newtons law of universal gravitation but is stated directly as vector calculus properties of the gravitational field
3759 know they have their adherents but do more or less esoteric branches of mathematics such as category theory and or quantum logic provide powerful tools for new theory development or are they just occasionally useful presentational frameworks more particularly is it worth investing the time to study these formalisms
3767 john cramer transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics tiqm is billed as resolving the fuzzy agnosticism of the copenhagen interpretation while avoiding the alleged ontological excesses of the many worlds interpretation yet it has low profile is this because no one care anymore about ontology in physics or is there something about tiqm which undermines belief in it
3769 ive got basic understanding of these facts the universe is little over billion years old our galaxy is almost that old our solar system is roughly billion years old the heavier elements carbon oxygen etc are only produced by stars when our solar system coalesced the matter that makes up the planets came from previous generation of stars meanwhile our sun is busy making its own slightly heavier elements but those arent ours those belong to the next generation after our star dies so were all sitting on rock whose matter was spewed out of star or stars that preceded this solar system but what want to know is how many cycles of coalescing fusing nucleosynthesis exploding and then repeating the cycle have this atoms in this ball of rock im standing on been through how do you know this can you tell by the make up of the matter in the solar system looking around the orion arm to see remnants of our former home
3777 how much information is contained in one qubit qubit is defined in wikipedia as left right left right where and are complex numbers subject to one complex number is equivalent to two real numbers which suggests that qubit is equivalent to four real numbers worth of information somehow doubt this is true how much information is contained in one mathematical qubit exactly transmitted how much information is contained in one physical photon alice and bob share an arbitrarily but not infinitely accurate clock they also have shared cordinate frame arbitrarily accurate relative location no relative motion no acceleration alice and bob can also have an arbitrarily complex shared coding system alice is allowed to send one and only one photon to bob between and oclock and bob receives it alice sends the photon directly to bob through an intervening vacuum if it makes difference assume the wavelength is exactly nm how much information can alice send bob assume it is not infinite but only limited by the precision of the clocks the availability of bandwidth alices range of transverse motion the accuracy of bobs telescope etc now assume the photon is delivered by single mode optical fiber so bob can gain no information by measuring the direction of the incoming photon also assume that eve puts in variable delay of two to three hours so bob receives the photon between and and thus cannot gain any information from the time of receipt how much information can alice now send bob is it exactly one qubit or something else we all know the plan where alice transmits vertical for and horizontal for bob measures exactly vertical or exactly horizontal and one bit per photon is transmitted is there any improvement possible
3798 watching quantum mechanics lectures and it was mentioned that it is pointless meaningless to try to talk question things that can not be tested measured is this principle and if so what is its name also does this apply to questions other than quantum mechanics does it make sense to ask if earth was the only object in universe if gravity would still exist although it seems intuitive to answer yes yet it is something that can never be tested verified it seems almost as meaningless as to ask if the universe was only made of unicorn would it have gravity as an analogy consider glottogony at some point it was banned as it seemed to be an unanswerable problem http en wikipedia org wiki origin of language
3799 cold fusion is being mentioned lot lately because of some new setup that apparently works this is an unverified claim see for example http hardware slashdot org story italian scientists demonstrate cold fusion http www physorg com news italian scientists cold fusion video html http www wipo int pctdb en wo jspwo ia it2008000532 display docs http www journal of nuclear physics com files rossi focardi paper pdf archived copy of that last link in the wayback machine given frequent http errors from that page while we should give the scientific community time to evaluate the set up and eventually replicate the results there is undoubtedly some skepticism that cold fusion would work at all because the claim is quite extraordinary in the past after fleischmann and pons announced their cold fusion results in perfectly good faith they were proven wrong by subsequent experiments what are the experimental realities that make fleischmann and pons style cold fusions experiments easy to get wrong would the same risks apply to this new set up

3863 feel this is somehow stupid question but dont know the true answer what happens to an astronaut whos floating in spaceship in space when it begins to move will the astronaut not move until he smashes onto wall in the spaceship or will he move with the spaceship due to gravity or does it depend on the speed acceleration of the spaceship if its too fast the astronaut will smash onto wall and if its enough slow hell move with the spaceship
3903 the textbooks have available explain that due to the infinite degrees of freedom of field the relevant object in qft is the lagrangian density lagrangian is then obtained for the field by integrating over space find the justification for this procedure unclear in classical mechanics the lagrangians of two particles may be added only if the particules do not interract does it mean that the lagrangian density concept is only valid for free field what happens in the case of interracting particles
3906 does anyone have good explanation of the physics and vectors of force involved in the skateboarding trick the ollie where the skater jumps and causes the skateboard to rise off the ground with him
3922 have read in couple of places that psip and psiq are fourier transforms of one another penrose but isnt fourier transform simply decomposition of function into sum or integral of other functions whereas the position and momentum wavefunctions are essentially different but related they must preserve expectation values like the relationship of classical mechanics frac dt where and are now expectation values for example momentum wave packet that has positive expectation value constant over time implies position wave packet that moves over time in some direction simply saying there is fourier transform seems to obscure this important relation
3933 in our physics lab we have milliwatt 001w helium neon laser despite the low power we were cautioned not to even look at reflections of the beam as it could cause permanent eye damage why is such low power level hazardous have 3w led which can look directly into which is more than 3000x more powerful
3957 the heliopause is now estimated to be something around au au astronomical unit about the earth sun distance see the wikipedia article http en wikipedia org wiki heliosphere from reading book on nasas voyager mission learned that before the launch of these spacecraft the expectation was that the heliopause was at around jupiter or saturns orbit which is about to au the book says that as the spacecraft continued to move away from the sun the space physicists kept increasing their estimate of the position of the heliopause if its about an energy or flux balance then the estimate would be defined by certain area of the sphere where the heliopause occurs and since areas are proportional to the square of the radius they got the number wrong by as much as thats huge underestimate of the suns output or huge overestimate of what goes on in interstellar space the book doesnt explain why it is that early estimates were wrong and didnt see an explanation perhaps someone knows and will give nice intuitive explanation for the estimates
3986 newtons bucket this thought experiment is originally due to sir isaac newton we have sphere of water floating freely in an opaque box in intergalactic space held together by surface tension and not rotating with respect to the distant galaxies now we set the box and water to rotate about some axis and we notice that the sphere flattens into an oblate spheroid how does the water know it spinning note newton thought this proved the concept of absolute rotation with respect to preferred spatial frame of reference perhaps these days we can do better or different
4005 recently saw some physical problems that can be modeled by equations with fractional derivatives and had some doubts is it possible to write an action that results in an equation with fractional derivatives for example consider hypothetical physical system with the principle of least action is there wave equation with the time derivative does such question make sense
4010 yesterday looked underwater with my eyes open and no goggles and realized cant see anything clearly everything looks very very blurry my guess is that the eye needs direct contact with air in order to work properly with water the refraction index is different and the eye lens are not able to compensate for correct focalization on the retina am right if so what lenses should one wear in order to see clearly while under water
4031 can anyone tell me where can read about the notion of short and long representations like what they are etc from where can learn the arguments which show that the bosonic subalgebra of cal and cal lie superalgebra are given by so32 times so2 and so32 times so3 respectively have often seen the following statement being made about the above which do not understand that primary states of these algebras are labeled by deltajh where delta is the scaling dimension of the primaries is its spin and is its charge or is its charge highest weight can someone explain the above labeling scheme dont understand much of the above somehow the above doesnt seem to fit with my elementary understanding of what are primary operators in cft which are defined using particular forms of the ope with stress energy tensor then one argues that for neq unitarity forces delta geq vert vert and for unitary representations occur when delta or delta geq vert vert havent been able to trace the above argument in any reference book or exposition it is said that the isolated representations which saturate the above unitarity bound for are all short apparently the witten index in this context is defined as tr fx delta and it vanishes on all long representations but is nonzero on all short representations further to understand the state content of all unitary representations in superconformal algebras people defined two different kinds of witten indexes cal and cal as cal tr fx delta beta delta and cal tr fx delta beta delta the above are apparently independent of beta would like to know why apparently the first index above receives contributions only from states with delta and all such states probably are annihilated in some sense and have something to do with the cohomology of the supercharge with charges frac frac similarly somehow the second index above receives contributions only from states with delta and all such states probably are also annihilated in some sense and have something to do with thecohomology of the supercharge with charges frac frac eventually see these indices to be writable as products sometimes infinite of rational polynomials in dont know how it happens this way of writing has something to do with single multitrace operators primaries another concept which dont understand would be grateful to hear of explanations of the above arguments and constructions and also if detailed references expositions exist for the above
4034 find myself greatly fascinated by physics and astronomy though really do not understand most of it for example avidly watch programs and read books that discuss our current search for unified theory which will unite the major forces strong interactive weak interactive electromagnetism on the one side with gravitation on the other also try to understand little bit about our work with subatomic particles the search for the higgs particle and our use of tools like the large hadron collider despite this enthusiasm find myself asking one major question what might come of definitively finding unified theory theory of everything most of the material absorb seem to imply that there are major technological advances from such an accomplishment but rarely provide examples obviously we cannot predict accurately all of the potential for the outcome of this scientific progression but get the impression that physicists and astronomers have great deal of pending problems that await the solution for layperson what kinds of advancements and breakthroughs might one realistically expect
4047 consider particle in potential well let assume it simple harmonic oscillator potential and the particle is in its ground state with energy e0 we measure its position measurement with high degree of accuracy which localises the particle corresponding to superposition of momentum and therefore energy states now we measure the particle energy measurement and happen to find that it e10 where did the extra energy come from in the textbooks it claimed that the extra energy comes from the act of observation but wonder how that could work measurement which probed the position of the particle can have delivered to it precise amount of energy while measurement might just have been passive no doubt there is entanglement here between the particle state and the measuring device but where and which measurement

4071 here are some depictions of electromagnetic wave similar to the depictions in other places isnt there an error it is logical to presume that the electric field should have maximum when magnetic field is at zero and vise versa so that there is no moment when the both vectors are zero at the same time otherwise one comes to conclusion that the total energy of the system becomes zero then grows to maximum then becomes zero again which contradicts the conservation law

4094 the planck length is defined as sqrt frac hbar so it is combination of the constants which believe are all lorentz invariants so think the planck length should also be lorentz invariant but there seem to be some confusion about that see the following paper magueijo lorentz invariance with an invariant energy scale the combination of gravity the quantum and relativity gives rise to the planck length or its inverse the planck energy these scales mark thresholds beyond which the old description of spacetime breaks down and qualitatively new phenomena are expected to appear this gives rise immediately to simple question in whose reference frame are and the thresholds for new phenomena but if is lorentz invariant their is no question about that is the same in all reference frames another confusing issue is that the planck mass from which the planck length is derived is often derived by setting equal the compton length lambda frac lorentz invariant length and the schwarzschild length frac 2gm which believe is not lorentz invariant since in the derivation of the schwarzschild metric it is assumed to be length measuring space distance but since compton wavelength and schwarzschild radius are not lengths of the same kind think such derivation is not valid so my question is is the planck length lorentz invariant and if so how to derive it then without using the compton wave length and the schwarzschild radius

4156 recently talked about qft with another physicist and mentioned that the quantum field theory of fermion is quantisation of its one particle quantum mechanical theory he denied this and responded that he rather sees the single particle qm as the non relativistic limit of qft he elaborated that the energies encountered are all much smaller than the particles mass so we can ignore all multi particle excitations in fock space and get an effective hilbert space consisting of all single particle excitations in turn asked what the corresponding limit of qed quantum mechanics of the massless photon is and he of course responded that there cant be nonrelativistic limit of qed exactly because of the masslessness but there is classical ed the classical limit of qed so is taking the classical or the nonrelativistic limit the same or does one include the other or is there some deep difference the question what does field theory mean has something to do with it but does not fully answer my question
4172 the way it is sometimes stated is that if we have certain amount of free will then subject to certain assumptions so must some elementary particles wikipedia that is confusing to me but it seems to be an amazing theorem it has been interpreted as ruling out hidden variable theories but there is still some dissent lubos has good discussion of it on his blog in the birthday blog for john horton conway assume it means that the outcomes of microscopic measurements are not deterministic what does the theorem assume and what does it prove

4212 suppose have the following double split experiment set up monochromatic electron source of low intensity which we can model as emitting single electron at time with energy diffraction screen at distance with two macroscopic slits equidistant from the source with width and distance from the center of the screen frac detector screen sitting parallel to the diffraction screen at distance which consists essentially of lattice of ammeters each connected with square surface of side classical quantum mechanics and experiments tell us that the following behaviour is experienced only one random ammeter is disturbed each time an electron is fired the probability distribution of the random ammeters being fired is as given by qm the interaction of the electron with the detector is not modeled the electron is essentially modeled as wave with interference and which ammeter is fired essentially an effect of particle behaviour cannot be discussed within this picture so the measurement or decoherence of the electron wave function corresponds to this switch between wave like and particle like models of the electron which is clearly unsatisfying intellectually because qm is vague about this it merely associates mathematical operations with the procedure without giving any particular physical or mathematical justification of it the questions do further refinements of qm qed or qft or st give any better explanation of what justifies the measurement recipe of classical qm by correctly modelling the electron detector interaction how in layman terms is the change of picture from wave to particle modeled if it is at all

4243 can understand that on small scales within an atom molecule the other forces are much stronger but on larger scales it seems that gravity is far stronger force planets are held to the sun by gravity so what does it mean to say that gravity is the weakest of the forces when in some cases it seems far stronger
4256 am wondering the noble gases are inert because they have closed shells and dont want to give that up but the noble metals such as copper silver rhodium gold dont seem to have this for example rhodium has electron configuration 4d 5s to me this looks very similar to the alkali metals which we all know are very reactive so why doesnt rhodium happily give up its electron same with silver 4d 5s why not give up the electron

4289 recently there was rapid communication published in phys rev prd titled gravity is not an entropic force that claimed that an experiment performed in with ultra cold neutrons in gravitational field disproves verlindes entropic approach to gravity the neutrons experiment gave results consistent with the predictions of newtonian gravity for the lowest energy state as understand it the author claims that the fact that verlindes entropic force comes from thermodynamic process that is irreversible or approximately reversible leads to non unitarity in the evolution of quantum systems the non unitarity then exponentially suppresses the eigenfunctions predicting results very much different than the newtonian thus that experiment is in contradiction to what is expected if verlindes approach is correct my questions are first of all is there anything else essential that am missing is there any response to that argument is that fatal problem with verlindes entropic approach is that fatal problem for any entropic approach updates on the discussion there is also this recent comment arxiv org abs once more gravity is not an entropic force arxiv org abs

4334 could life on earth survive large pole shift caused by an asteroid collision became aware that there are people who believe that the earths pole suddenly shifts that is its rotational axis changes rather than its magnetic axis this is listed in wikipedia as follows cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis the cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis is the conjecture that there have been rapid shifts in the relative positions of the modern day geographic locations of the poles and the axis of rotation of planet for the earth such dynamic change could create calamities such as floods and tectonic events the field has attracted pseudoscientific authors offering variety of evidence including psychic readings http en wikipedia org wiki cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis while watching chess game at the local club fellow member told me that hed found the solution for where oil came from it was long and involved one of its features required that the earths axis be changed by degrees due to the collision of an asteroid few million years ago the idea was that the earths axis used to be in the plane of the earths orbit but then it was knocked into its current rotation axis tilt of around degrees this changed the climate and buried lot of stuff the axis shift seemed to be an obvious weak link with the theory in that it involves the simplest physics told him that any asteroid large enough to change the earths axis an appreciable amount degrees would cause so much damage as to destroy all life on the surface of the planet including its oceans id have forgotten about it but the other night while listening to the radio guest appeared who had an idea that was similar so this seems like common target for pseudoscience and so my question is this would an asteroid collision sufficient to immediately change the earths rotation axis wipe out all life on the planet

4407 of course there is pretty hot stuff too for example suns but isnt the vacuum of space the perfect containment for heat and shouldnt the rare collision with particles even heat up an object that floats around in space why arent they hot from time to time is it because they loose their heat by radiant heat and if so does radiant heat emission always occur until the object is the same temperature as the surrounding or does it depend on other factors

4519 ive come across this quote attributed to misner thorne wheeler from their book gravitation mathematics was not sufficiently refined in to cleave apart the demands for no prior geometry and for geometric coordinate independent formulation of physics einstein described both demands by single phrase general covariance the no prior geometry demand actually fathered general relativity but by doing so anonymously disguised as general covariance it also fathered half century of confusion what was the confusion
4586 have been reading hawkings brief history of time and it has gotten me thinking about einsteins theory of relativity in that it assumes that an object must have infinite mass if it is to be traveling at the speed of light please correct if im wrong in my beginners knowledge of physics but do light waves have any sort of measurable mass or in that same vein do sound waves is it somehow possible
4637 as understand light is what is more generally called electromagnetic radiation right the energy radiated by star by an antenna by light bulb by your cell phone etc are all the same kind of energy electromagnetic energy photons traveling through space so far so good if not please clarify on the other hand there are these things called electromagnetic fields for example earths magnetic field or the magnetic field around magnets the electric field around charge or those fields that coils and capacitors produce now here is my question are these two things electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation two forms of the same thing or they are two completely different phenomena if they are different things what does light radiation have to do with electromagtetism im not asking for complex theoretical answer just an intuitive explanation
4731 in classical mechanics using newtons laws the ellipticity of orbits is derived it is also said that the center of mass is at one of the foci each body will orbit the center of the mass of the system my question is are the assumptions in and correct follow up question assuming the distance from the centre of the mass to each body remains the same do we have two bodies orbiting the centre of the mass of the system in an elliptical or circular orbit finally with elliptical orbits if the heavier mass is supposed to be in one of the foci if there is any significance to second focus what is it is it lagrange point by any chance or does it have some other mathematical property
4761 the hotter something is glowing the more white blue it appears dying medium sized star expands cools and becomes red giant for while but eventually it is going to gravitationally collapse once enough iron fe is accumulated in the core then it blows the outer layers away and what is left collapses into white dwarf what makes the dwarf shine and why is it white does the luminosity decreases as the object cools down or is there some other reaction that keeps it glowing for long time can white dwarf turn brown or black never to be seen again do all white dwarfs turn into neutron stars eventually
4784 one thing ive heard stated many times is that most or many physicists believe that despite the fact that they have not been observed there are such things as magnetic monopoles however ive never really heard good argument for why this should be the case the explanations ive heard tend to limit themselves to saying that it would create beautiful symmetry within maxwells equations or similar but dont see how the fact that it would be beautiful is any kind of reason for why they should exist that doesnt sound like good science to me so obviously there must be at least another reason apart from this to believe in the existence of natural magnetic monopoles im aware that recent research has shown that metamaterials or something similar can emulate magnetic monopole behaviour but thats surely not the same thing can anyone provide me with some insight
4789 am doing some self study in between undergrad and grad school and came across the beastly wigner eckart theorem in sakurais modern quantum mechanics was wondering if someone could tell me why it is useful and perhaps just help me understand bit more about it have had two years of undergrad mechanics and think have reasonably firm grasp of the earlier material out of sakurai so dont be afraid to get little technical
4799 how are photons counted what is the experimental setup used to count photons from laser or even lamp of course in the case of the lamp would be able to count only the photons that pass through an area sensor in particular observation point if at all possible setup that can be done at home is preferred one that avoids expensive instruments as much as possible may be crazy to even think this is possible the key point is we cant count photons like we count sheep so how do we infer from the effects of single photons and count from there can start with frac hc lambda and all other manifestations of energy like heat or motion

4959 noethers theorem is one of those surprisingly clear results of mathematical calculations for which am inclined to think that some kind of intuitive understanding should or must be possible however dont know of any do you independence of time energy conservation independence of position momentum conservation independence of direction angular momentum conservation know that the mathematics leads in the direction of lie algebra and such but would like to discuss whether this theorem can be understood from non mathematical point of view also
4990 my professor in class went little over chaos theory and basically said that newtonian determinism no longer applies since as time goes to infinity no matter how close together two initial points are the distance between them will increase greatly but why isnt this merely matter of the imprecision of our measuring instruments if we can somehow know our initial conditions exactly wouldnt we still be able to calculate what the system will be like at some time in the future
5005 in my opinion the grassmann number apparatus is one of the least intuitive things in modern physics remember that it took lot of effort when was studying this the problem was not in the algebraic manipulations themselves it was rather psychological why would one want to consider such crazy stuff later one just gets used to it and have no more such strong feelings for the anticommuting numbers but this psychological barrier still exists for newbies is there way to explain or motivate one to learn the grassmann numbers maybe there is simple yet practical problem that demonstrates the utility of those it would be great if this problem would provide the connection to some not so advanced areas of physics like non relativistic qm and or statistical physics
5027 imagine linear decrease in concentration from left to right using ficks first law frac psi for all from left to right we have the same flux amount because the decrease is linear so jx according to ficks second law frac psi frac psi frac so frac jx so dj dx is just since the 2nd derivative of line is yet this seems unintuitive would expect as long as there is concentration gradient there should be change in concentration at each point until the concentration is completely uniform there must be an error in my math or reasoning where is it edit to clarify the boundary conditions imagine closed box with no out flow or in flow at the edges
5029 recently it has been studied non abelian anyons in some solid state systems these states are being studied for the creation and manipulation of qubits in quantum computing but how these non abelian anyons can arise if all particles involved are fermions in other words how electronic states can have different statistics than the fermionic if all electrons are fermions
5031 one thing know about black holes is that an object gets closer to the event horizon gravitation time dilation make it move more slower from an outside perspective so that it looks like it take an infinite amount of time for the object to reach the event horizon it seems like similar process should slow the formation of the black hole itself as the star collapses its gravitational time dilation make itself collapse more slowly this make me wonder are what astronomers claim to be black holes really black holes or are they stars that progressively make themselves more similar to one without actually reaching the stage of having an event horizon edit contemplating one answer realize the question is ambiguous what does finite time mean in general relativity here is less ambiguous question is there connected solution of dimensional general relativity with one space like slice not have singularity and another space like slice having one
5066 liquid and solid chemical fuels in rockets are very expensive and inefficient have heard of solar sails but what are the most realistic space travel fuels that will be used in the future to get close to the speed of light
5118 is this just historical artifact that the particle physics community decided at some point to call all of the pre oscillation physics by the name the standard model the reason ask is because often see articles and books say something to the effect the strongest hint of physics beyond the sm are the non zero neutrino masses as if this is something significant and mysterious whereas from what gathered from the answer to question asked previously lepton mixing is something natural and unsurprising so why arent neutrino oscillations considered part of the sm am not asking out of any sociological interest but because want to make sure havent underestimated the significance of the discovery of neutrino oscillations
5190 know the basics of solar system like how earth moves around sun and that we have so many planets elliptical orbit of earth and how far is sun from earth etc etc want to take step back and understand how mankind has been able to construct this knowledge of solar system piece by piece questions sun is something we see on daily basis so it would not be strange if humankind got curious to know about it and made theoriesobservationsmaths to prove it how did copernicus and others came up with the theory that earth moves around sun in elliptical orbit how did they prove it has there been any actual way by which we have actually observed sun being in center and earth moving around in elliptical orbit or we made such theory and result of this theory have been proved by other observations like daynightchange in weather at point and at different points on earth
5192 how has the distance between sun and earth been calculated also what is the size of the sun
5194 how is the speed of light calculated my knowledge of physics is limited to how much studied till high school one way that comes to my mind is if we throw light from one point to another of known distance and measure the time taken we could know the speed of light but do we have such precise time measuring tool
5217 first discrete examples in computer screen can specify any 2d point with just one single number pixel order starting count from first at upper left and going on left2right and up2down like reading till last one at right bottom corner then dont need two numbers to specify position just one same can extend to other dimensions can use same trick to describe point inside discrete cube once have covered screen like area descend plane level plane then cube made of above planes so single number can map any point in 3d discrete cube what about continuous one same thing using differential dx instead of discrete points or planes and thats all of course as differential is not well defined as discrete this wont be so easy anyway my question is what is good definition of dimension that avoid these tricks there is one finally another way to take 3d to 1d is reversible transformationpairing function like this 3d point xyz the only restriction for this method is that equivalent 3d coords should be lesser than very easy thing at least in the known universe even in planks units and could of course be changed for lesser numbers but like concrete examples
5224 the schrodinger equation governs the possible time evolution of wave function expressed as partial differential equation isnt this equivalent to the simpler equation omega hbar 2m any wave function that satisfies this dispersion relation will also satisfy schrodingers equation and the equation above is lot easier to understand
5235 if someone or some robot on the moon were to point laser at the earth how many watts would the laser need to be easily seen with the un aided eye from earth obviously this depends on number of factors assume the beam is made divergent enough to cover latitudes 60s to 60n wavelength 532nm and the beam originates from fully lit area of the moon and the observing is done in full darkness can work out watts meter square from the laser but dont know how to work out the watts meter square from the moon and dont have clue about how the eye would perceive the contrast
5265 during the breakfast with my colleagues question popped into my head what is the fastest method to cool cup of coffee if your only available instrument is spoon qualitative answer would be nice but if we could find mathematical model or even better make the experiment we dont have the means here for this it would be great so far the options that we have considered are any other creative methods are also welcome stir the coffee with the spoon pros the whirlpool has greater surface than the flat coffee so it is better for heat exchange with the air due to the difference of speed between the liquid and the surrounding air the bernoulli effect should lower the pressure and that would cool it too to keep the atmospheric pressure constant cons joule effect should heat the coffee leave the spoon inside the cup as the metal is good heat conductor and we are not talking about wooden spoon and there is some part inside the liquid and other outside it should help with the heat transfer right side question about this is what is better to put it like normal or reversed with the handle inside the cup think it is better reversed as there is more surface in contact with the air as in the cpu heat sinks insert and remove the spoon repeatedly the reasoning about this is that the spoon cools off faster when its outside personally think it doesnt pay off the difference between keeping it always inside as as it gets cooler the lesser the temperature gradient and the worse for the heat transfer

5535 there are some interactions that are forbidden by conservation laws an electron cannot turn into positron by conservation of charge and photon cannot turn into positron electron pair by conservation of momentum my question is if every interaction between say up to or particles that is consistent with all known conservation laws have been observed
5614 can you suggest some references for rigorous treatment of thermodynamics want things like reversibility equilibrium to be clearly defined in terms of the basic assumptions of the framework
5669 id like to make comparison of prices availability and properties of semiconductor substrate layers like si ge gap aln etc wonder what are the problems related to getting such data what are the leading companies that sell such things whats the quality waiting time and so on im not going to buy one its just little research thats why ask here and not the companies directly your own experiences what problems youve encountered and maybe some sample prices or company names are much appreciated
5670 electricity takes the path of least resistance is this statement correct if so why is it the case if there are two paths available and one for example has resistor why would the current run through the other path only and not both
5682 hopf algebra is nice object full of structure bialgebra with an antipode to get some idea what it looks like group itself is hopf algebra considered over field with one element usual multiplication diagonal comultiplication obvious units and inverse for the antipode for less pathological example group algebra and universal enveloping algebra can be both quite naturally turned into hopf algebra it all obviously relates to representation theory and lots of other neat stuff so much for the math related stuff now ive heard that there should also be some applications to physics for one thing and this will be very vague and probably also wrong feynman diagrams should somehow carry structure of hopf algebra with multiplication given by joining of two lines into vertex and comultiplication as splitting it reminds me of cobordisms but am not sure it really makes sense any idea whether something like this works besides that heard people try to formalize renormalization using hopf algebras found some papers but am not sure where to start anyone care to give an overview how does this stuff work and whether its leading anywhere anything else sorry if this is way to vague and there is actually whole industry of hopfy physics if so just try to give some most important examples preferably with references
5702 know that light or electromagnetic radiation in general attenuates in intensity as the square of the distance it travels why does it attenuate are the photons being scattered by the medium they pass through also know that the energy carried by light quanta is function of their frequency only if the answer to is yes then can we possibly transmit light energy and information over infinite distances through perfect vacuum may be wrong on some assumptions so please enlighten me
5721 let suppose you roll die and it falls into hidden place for example under furniture then although the experiment has already been made the die already has number to show that value can not be known so the experiment was not fully realized then till you see the dies top side the probability remain see no difference between this and the wave function collapse at least as an analogy can someone explain deeper difference thanks
5773 in quantum mechanics the state of free particle in three dimensional space is mathbb more accurately the projective space of that hilbert space here am ignoring internal degrees of freedom otherwise it would be mathbb otimes but lets say it is not that time of the month the observables are operators in that space and the dynamics is describe by the schrodinger equation or in other equivalent ways if we have more particles then it is mathbb 3n my question is are there any examples where one considers system with configuration space general manifold instead of mathbb say system of particles particle with some restrictions so that the state space is 2m there might be physical reasons why this is of no interest and would be interested to here them what am interested in is seeing is specific or general examples worked out in detail for example system with given hamiltonian where one can explicitly find the spectrum or if that is too much to ask for an example where the system has very different properties from the usual case say particle living on the upper half plane with the lobachevsky geometry may be some connection to number theory am aware that there is quantum field theory on curved spacetime am interested in quantum mechanics edit just small clarification the examples would like to see do not have to come from real physics they can be toy models or completely unrealistic mathematical models something along the lines take your favorite manifold and pretend this is the space we live in what can we say about qm in it the choice of doesnt have to do anything with general relativity as said the upper half plane is interesting or quotients of it by interesting discrete groups or generalizations gamma backslash mathbb or anything at all the answers so far are interesting hoping to see more
5792 well the possion bracket aqpbqp equiv sum left dfrac partial partial dfrac partial partial dfrac partial partial dfrac partial partial right is coordinate transformation according to the words of this wikipedia page link http en wikipedia org wiki poisson bracket it places mechanics and dynamics in the context of coordinate transformations specifically in coordinate planes such as canonical position momentum or canonical position canonical transformation the jacobian of for example aqp and bqp has the same form as the terms in the parenthesis from what to what coordinates does the bracket transform does it make any sense to make comparison poisson bracket and the jacobian
5824 just saw this trick where cup of water is turned over onto table without spilling using piece of cardboard after removing the cardboard from underneath the cup the person then removes the cup in particular way lifts straight up and twists and lo and behold the water stays in its position as if the cup were still there watch the video to fully understand is this really possible if so and the real question im looking to have answered is how after further research it appears that deionized water is needed as well
5839 does magnetic propagation follow the speed of light if you had some magnet of incredible strength and attached an iron wire that is one light year long to it would the other end of the iron wire begin to show magnetic field in year or could it possibly be faster than year

5851 according to the first law of thermodynamics sourced from wikipedia in any process in an isolated system the total energy remains the same so when lasers are used for cooling in traps similar to the description here http optics colorado edu kelvin classes opticslab lasercooling3 doc pdf where is the heat transferred from what gather of cursory reading on traps whether laser magnetic etc the general idea is to isolate the target then transfer heat from it thereby cooling it dont understand how sending photons at an atoms can cause that structure to shed energy and this mechanism seems to be the key to these systems
5888 heard on podcast recently that the supermassive black holes at the centre of some galaxies could have densities less than water so in theory they could float on the substance they were gobbling up can someone explain how something with such mass could float please see the below link for the podcast in question http www universetoday com podcast supermassive black holes
5899 in my country it is big business now to sell water structuring facilities promoters telling that after passing through them the water obtaining fantastic abilities basing on the fact that water can keep information coded in molecular domains chained by weak hydrogen bonds this structured water is panacea for all diseases guess it is all started from this guy but now they have bunch of popular documentary films and many official academics supporting these ideas which arguments should use to convince my friends theyre charlatans dont have grade in physics but from my basic university course believe it is nonsense think there must be some popular and simple facts that can be convincing enough for non professionals who can understand physics at the high school level
5905 the force of gravity is constantly being applied to an orbiting object and therefore the object is constantly accelerating why doesnt gravity eventually win over the objects momentum like force such as friction eventually slows down car that runs out of gas understand think how relativity explains it but how does newtonian mechanics explain it

5994 seem to be missing something basic ive been trying to get simple orbital simulation working and my two objects are earth around the sun my problem is this placed the earth at 93m miles away from the sun or 155m km as understand it the orbital velocity of something at 155m km from the sun is sqrt frac gm plugging in the numbers for the sun get velocity of frac mathrm mathrm however if want to get the acceleration that the sun has upon the earth use frac gm for the sun and 155m km get an acceleration of frac mathrm mathrm now start with simple body at the proper radius out along the axis and give it simply vector of along the axis then start applying the acceleration to it and the acceleration of the sun is simply not enough to hold the earth if the earth starts with vector of and after and add the acceleration vector of to it you can see that after single second it doesnt move whole lot if chunk things to days seconds then the acceleration vector is only roughly day but the velocity vector is frac mathrm mathrm day frac mathrm mathrm times frac mathrm mathrm day as you can imagine the isnt going to move that much towards the sun understand that better simulations use better techniques than simply adding basic vectors together but thats not what this is seem to be missing something fundamental had assumed that given the correct velocity that the pull of the sun should keep the earth in orbit but the pull that im using doesnt seem to be having the desired effect so im curious what basic doh thing im missing here edit for lubo motl answer perhaps theres something more fundamental im missing here understand you point but is was doing that math fine simply have an object with velocity vector then apply an acceleration at right angle do that for seconds to come up with new right angle velocity vector then add that to the original vector to come up with the objects new vector then take that vector apply to the current position of the object and arrive at new position clearly there is granularity issue which makes some amount of seconds better choice for model than others but this is high school level simple mechanics so theres going to be some stepping chose one day so that my little dot of planet on my screen would move if update every 10th of second real time and each update is day then should get rough orbit thats really 365ish polygon in little over 30s real time if choose step size of second then my acceleration right angle velocity vector thats in magnitude that vector is added to the original vector of at right angles giving me new vector of thats after one second thats not much of bump its barely blip if apply one days full of acceleration all at once am obligated to not only multiply the acceleration by but also the original vector since its and we have thus giving me proportionally the same vector just longer and its still just bump so im mis applying something somewhere here as think the numbers are fine im simply doing it wrong trying to figure out what that wrong part is edit responding to platypus lover thank you very much for the simple code you posted it showed me my error my confusion was conflating updating of the vector with the calculation of the velocity vector felt that had to multiply both the original vector and the acceleration amount by the time step which would give me the silly results it was just confused in my head
6026 to put it bluntly weather is described by the navier stokes equation which in turn exhibits turbulence so eventually predictions will become unreliable am interested in derivation of the time scale where weather predictions become unreliable let us call this the critical time scale for weather on earth we could estimate this time scale if we knew some critical length and velocity scales since weather basically lives on an with radius of the earth we seem to have natural candidate for the critical length scale so assume that the relevant length scale is the radius of the earth about 6400km and the relevant velocity scale some typical speed of wind say 25m but frankly am taking this number out of well thin air then get typical time scale of cdot which is roughly three days the result three days seems not completely unreasonable but would like to see an actual derivation does anyone know how to obtain more accurate and reliable estimate of the critical time scale for weather on earth
6052 decades ago was in physics ph program made hash of things and quite rightly was dropped from the program since then ive had very satisfying career as computer programmer and picked up an in applied math im currently working in bioinformatics research lab and really enjoying myself think might want to retire in five or six years and lately ive been daydreaming about returning to my first love and entering physics ph program this would be entirely for my personal satisfaction have no intention of seeking further career in physics id just like to spend few years working in physics research group ive been out of physics too long to really know what area id like to work in but im thinking quantum computing or quantum optics while wouldnt require any financial support recognize that taking on ph student is still major investment of resources for researcher my hope is that my years of experience in software development would be enough of an asset to make it worth their while im just curious if there is anybody in the audience whos done something similar or any faculty who can give an opinion about whether this is realistic notion update thanks to all for your answers and comments think nibots comment that the thing to do is to establish relationships with some faculty might like to work with is the most actionable answer really appreciated all the other anecdotes and advice though
6108 am looking for good source on group theory aimed at physicists id prefer one with good general introduction to group theory not just focusing on lie groups or crystal groups but one that covers all the basics and then in addition talks about the specific subjects of group theory relevant to physicists also some stuff on representations etc is wigners text good way to start guess its classic but fear that its notation might be bit outdated
6147 okay im asking question similar to this one here time dilation what happens when you bring the observers back together specifically am curious about specific angle on the second part of his question regarding when two moving frames of reference for are brought back together and how it knows which one should be still young the accepted answer on that question says that it is whichever for experienced the forces of acceleration deceleration but isnt that the whole point of relativity is that its all well relative that it is not possible to say with certainty that it was the traveler in the spaceship who was accelerating decelerating isnt it the case that it is just as legitimate to say that the universe and people on the planet accelerated decelerated and the traveler in the spaceship was stationary this would therefore then lead to that the universe and planet side people should remain young and the spaceship occupant should be old no does dilation temporal spatial just generally apply to the smaller of the two fors or is there some other system or rule which decides which for gets dilated

6220 two towns are at the same elevation and are connected by two roads of the same length one road is flat the other road goes up and down some hills will an automobile always get the best mileage driving between the two towns on the flat road versus the hilly one if operated by perfect driver with knowledge of the route is there any hilly road on which better mileage can be achieved
6256 ill break this down to two related questions with fission bomb uranium or plutonium atoms are split by high energy neutron thus releasing energy and more neutrons where does the energy come from most books ive ever come across simply state mc and leave it at that is it that matter say proton or neutron is actually converted into energy that would obviously affect the elements produced by the fission since there would be less matter at the end it would also indicate exactly how energy could be released per atom given the fixed weight of subatomic particle remember hearing once that the energy released is actually the binding energy that previously held the nucleus together with fusion bomb two hydrogen isotopes are pushed together to form helium and release energy same question where does this energy come from is matter actually converted or are we talking about something else here sorry is this is rather basic havent done physics since high school
6271 what is physical law theory and what is the relationship among them know this is very basic question so any reference to epistemology will be greatly appreciated
6300 so one thing has been annoying me ever since learned about orbital hybridization you explain the shape of molecules by postulating that the orbitals of multi electron atoms are linear combinations of the orbitals of the hydrogen atom fine heres what gets me and ive asked several chemistry professors about this and havent gotten an answer if measure the orbital angular momentum of an electron in hydrogen atom get the value hbar sqrt ell ell so an orbital has angular momentum and orbital has angular momentum hbar so what happens when measure the orbital angular momentum of sp electron do get frac hbar with probability or do get hbar with probability and with probability are the original orbitals really the fundamental thing and the hybridized orbitals fundamentally just quantum superpositions of these things or does the multi electron potential create state that just looks like linear combination of one and orbitals or is the actual answer more complicated and this heuristic picture that im taking too seriously
6302 the wiki higgs boson site has an interesting diagram illustrating likely higgs mass intervals that experiments lep tevatron or indirect measurements have determined with confidence level it posits that the feasible mass ranges are in the intervals of about gev or gev the tevatron confirmed the existance of the top quark gev in so it had the energy and time to detect the higgs in the gev ranges but could not given lhcs greater energy and luminosity why havent there been anouncements of the higgs discovery do we understand enough about potential particle creation to definitively know they are higgs decays
6312 stop me if im wrong but displacement is for example when you enter bathtub the water level rises around you what happens when displacement isnt possible ill give an example have two blocks off steel one at the top of chamber and one at the bottom there is gap between the two blocks that is filled with water there is no gap between the two blocks and the side of the chamber the water cannot escape what happens when the two block come together in effect squashing the water where does the water go

6438 question in four parts what are the main problems which supersymmetry purports to solve what would constitute lack of evidence for susy at the proposed lhc energy scales certain predicted superpartners are not in fact observed are there alternative theoretical approaches which would address the susy problem set and which would still be credible in such an lhc no susy scenario where would lhc disconfirmation of susy leave string theory would like to think that these four points could be taken together as one question
6446 im layman without university background in physics math since dont have background reading paper is more of an effort consequently when come across an interesting paper cant really just give it glance and see if it is science or psuedoscience this question is about this paper the schwarzschild proton nassin haramein originally at the resonance project archived here by the wayback machine on edit by bcrowell this web page provides very detailed discussion and offers heavy criticism if the advent of the internet has taught me anything its that there is an inverse relationship between cost to publish and the need to vet what is published on the other hand lisis e8 paper has taught me that paper doesnt necessarily need to be correllated to an establishment like the perimeter institute or the institute for advanced study two examples off the top of my head to be worth reading is the paper worth reading
6450 is there an accepted analogy conceptual aid for the higgs field in physics there are many accepted conceptual aids such as schr dingers cat maxwells demon im sure im missing many but you get the idea is there an accepted standard aid for the higgs saw popular treatment of the higgs boson with peter higgs he talked about pearls being dragged through treacle but the analogy wasnt fully fleshed out just two second video clip if there is not an accepted standard aid what do the various professionals here use to aid explicating to non professionals
6461 the electron is particle the mass of electron is times rm kg but why is the mass exactly what it is what in physics defines the mass of elementary particle
6464 added times down vote for now down voter is this religion or physics please try to explain your decision im confused about this in physics we know for vacuum but think that there is contradiction in this term the quantum fluctuations are the phenomena that contradicts the vacuum existence because according to them the vacuum isnt the empty space in vacuum the creation of particle antiparticle pairs is allowed for small times and this is also proven in practice from the other side the relativistic theory says about space time that interactions like gravitation bend the vacuum empty space there seems to be contradiction to me if vacuum is an empty space then we cant bend it because we cant bend something nonexistent in other words we cant bend nothing can empty space really exist in physics edit1 quote lubo motl by definition the space without energy is the space whose total value of energy is equal to but this space is nonexistent so it is abstract and should exist only in our mind why is so my second statement of this post says that in physics we cant bend nothing because such bending is only thinking and not physics another possibility is that space is unknown kind of energy but this is contradiction in modern physics edit2 can any physics believe that nothing exists by mathematical logic no and mathematic is elementary tool in physics anything other than that is religion nothing empty space without energy is only logical state edit3 quote roy simpson the general relativity vacuum is space time model region without matter and lubo motl says by definition the space without energy is the space whose total value of energy is equal to agree but this is only mathematical euclidean space time so this is only mathematic and not physics with other words this is only method of mathematical mapping but in real not theoretic physics we cant mapping empty things empty is only logical state edit4 roy simpsons argumentation seems to me acceptable quote roy simpson einstein struggled with this too and the problem has come to be known as the hole argument within gr you have to decide whether you are just interested in grs vacuum empty space or the full physical vacuum which includes quantum aspects as well thanks

6488 understand the reason that bicycle pedals are oppositely threaded on either side what dont understand is why it works because im missing something take the right pedal for example its threads are right handed so it would be tightened by turning it clockwise if the pedal were in between you and the bike now imagining this from the same perspective person pedaling makes the right pedal constantly turn counter clockwise relative to the crank if theres any friction between the pedal and the bolt attaching it to the crank would imagine that it would create force that would try to turn the bolt counter clockwise along with the pedal this is the opposite of what happens and ive seen the bolts unthread after pedaling backwards lot myself what am missing

6518 was taught that for the dirac equation to work you need matrices of the following form tr alpha eigenvalues or previous points together equal number of negative and positive eigenvalues thus even dimension alpha and beta meet the anti commutator relation my advanced qm professor told me convincingly that there are only linearly independent 2d matrices the pauli matrices which can be used in 2d thats one short so youll need at least 4d matrices now my qft professor who excells at confusing me and not only me mind you stated that it is perfectly possible to use only 2d matrices by extending the pauli matrix set with another one think hes wrong but he seems too old and wise to be wrong and didnt remember all conditions above at the time so didnt want to argue without arguments is it possible to 2d ify the dirac equation and not only in 2d system like graphene but in general thanks
6524 am developing an application that uses the magnetometer inside smart phones to detect orientation the earths magnetic field have noticed that when the phone is held close to metal structure such as iron steel railings there is huge deflection in the magnetometer reading there is no externally induced current flowing through the structure it has induced warped the magnetic field by its own my question is which types of metals can show this effect or more generally which type of elements can show this effect suppose ferromagnetic materials do show this effect and paramagnetic materials like aluminium will show very weak effect what about diamagnetic substances such as copper update changed the title to mention passively understand that copper coil forced to carry current would induce magnetic field that interferes with the earths magnetic field but does the coil distort the earths magnetic field when no emf is applied
6561 im statistician with little training in physics and would just like to know the general consensus on few things im reading book by john moffat which basically tries to state how gr makes failed predictions in certain situations know gr is well extremely tested but imagine all physicist are aware it doesnt always hold up the book tries to put forth modified theories of gravity that make do without the need of dark matter and dark energy to make gr match real world observations ie speed of galaxy rotations etc are modified theories of gravity creditable is dark energy matter the ether of the 20th 21st century is it likely scientists are looking for something that simply doesnt exist and there are unknown fundamental forces at work whats the best evidence for its existence other than observations based on the bullet cluster
6581 consider cylinder of permanently magnetized material with uniform magnetization pointing along the cylindrical symmetry axis the direction the magnet is rotating about its cylindrical symmetry axis with angular velocity omega what electric field does the rotating magnet generate backstory moving permanent magnets generally generate an electric field even in cases where vec in the case of uniform motion this electric field is straightforward to determine using lorentz boost im interested in cases where the simple lorentz boost does not work edit as perceived by some of the answers am not specifically interested in cylinder if your solution is for ring sphere or pretty much any nontrivial cylindrically symmetric object rotating about its cylindrical symmetry axis im interested as long as vec landau and lifshitz describe similar interesting case where the rotating magnet is also conductor im interested in the case where the rotating object is not conductor unipolar induction is very interesting but again involves rotating conductor which am not asking about
6584 in non relativistic qm on one hand we have the following relations langle psi rangle hbar frac partial partial psix langle psi rangle hbar frac partial partial psip on the other hand despite the similarities the relations cannot be directly applied to energy and time langle psi rangle hbar frac partial partial psit langle psi rangle hbar frac partial partial psie just wondering how can one mathematically prove that the classical time which means no qft or relativity involved unlike its close relative position is not hermitian operator ask your pardon if you feel the question clumsy or scattered but to be honest if can clearly point out where the core issue of the problem is may have already answered it by myself
6588 could someone explain in simple terms lets say limited to high school calculus vocabulary why decibels are measured on logarithmic scale this isnt homework just good old fashioned curiousity
6650 what prevents static black hole from accumulating more charge than its maximum is it just simple coulomb repulsion is the answer the same for rotating black holes edit what understand from the answers given so far is that maximum charge is moving target you can add charge to black hole but coulomb repulsion guarantees that you will do so in manner than will increase maximum charge value is this correct
6682 is there any good software for construction optical paths in geometrical optics more specifically want features like draw in mathbb objects dotsk with indices of refraction dotsn and light sources in mathbb light sources dotsl define some light sources or just light rays and the program constructs the optical path of those rays through dotsk define point and the program constructs the optical path between the light sources and the given point draw some specific optical elements like lenses concave convex mirrors and do things like above construct automatically virtual images 3d drawings would be fine would prefer free software for linux

6720 sign of tsunami is that the water rushes away from the shore then comes back to higher levels it seems that waves should be both and polarized and that some tsunamis should go in the opposite direction that is the first indication of them would be that the water begins rising however other than situations very close to the source it seems that the wave always begins with the water drawing away from the coast for example the wikipedia article on tsunamis states that in the indian ocean tsunami drawback was not reported on the african coast or any other eastern coasts it reached this was because the wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the fault line and upwards on the western side the western pulse hit coastal africa and other western areas the above is widely repeated however when you search the scientific literature you find that this is not the case proc iaspei general assembly cape town south africa hermann fritza jose borrerob somalia field survey after the december indian ocean tsunami the italian speaking vice council mahad said standing at the waterfront outside the mosque upon the arrival of the tsunami figure 10a gave very detailed description of the initial wave sequence at first drawback was noticed followed by first wave flooding the beach next the water withdrew again by before the second wave partially flooded the town finally the water withdrew again by offshore before the third and most powerful wave washed through the town these drawbacks correspond to and depths the detailed eyewitness account of the numerous drawbacks is founded on the locations of the offshore pillars so is there physical reason why tsunamis perhaps over longer distances tend to be oriented so that the first effect is withdrawal of the water
6721 after watching the first episode of wonders of the solar system one question came up which is not explained bryan cox says that ultimately the universe will be devoid of matter so not even single particle will actually exist this however seems to be state where entropy is zero there is no entropy since theres no disorder on the other hand the 2nd law of thermodynamics says that the disorder increases so am pretty sure that am thinking wrong about this in someway can imagine that the answer might be that an empty universe has an infinite amount of entropy but it feels pretty counter intuitive for me
6750 one often comes across news articles that claim that an earthquake shifted the earths axis http news google com earthquake 20shifted 20or 20shifts 20earth 27s 20axis if you ignore the influence of other celestial bodies an internal event like an earthquake surely cant change the direction of the angular momentum of the earth unless stuff is ejected out of earth since angular momentum has to be conserved in the absence of an external torque so the axis has to remain fixed am missing something or are geologists trying to say that the resulting movement of tectonic plates causes change in the point of intersection of the axis which remains the same and the plates that include the poles so that it seems as if the axis has shifted edit some articles mention the value of the shift in the axis and also the change in the length of the day if as ted bunns answer indicates below the shift in the axis isnt actually real but is because of the movement of tectonic plates with respect to the axis shouldnt the shift be different at the north and south poles how are the shifts and the change in day length calculated

6782 this concerns the famous two slit experiment electrons or photons or your favorite particle doesnt matter as we all know the attempt to detect which slit the quanta pass through leads to loss of the diffraction pattern the interesting part of the experiment is describing what happens when neither slit has particle detector it is commonly said that each particle goes through both slits at the same time at the popular level this makes qm seem weird and mystical and at the professional level we might cite the copenhagen interpretation which boils down to dont ask questions about things you cant observe and so we dont speak of such things just do the math how sound this reasoning is at fundamental level can we really conclude each quantum goes through both slits yet as whole entity can we define it went through both slits observable is there proper hermitian operator with suppose eigenvalues and that can distinguish quantum going through both slits vs only one slit but without saying which one perhaps it would make more sense to think about an slit experiment and ask about hermitian operator that can report the number of slits quantum takes suspect im not asking this question quite right but have an intuition theres something yet to be dug up from this age old gedankenexperiment
6827 why do optical fibers usually have cladding ok if you put make bundle of optical fibers this prevents that light leaks from one fiber to another fiber in contact however are there other reasons to use claddings are there applications of optical fibers without claddings am mainly interested in optical fibres which can be described by geometrical optics multimode fibers
6898 saw an interview with ed witten where he said one way to confirm string theory is to observe giant string floating in space left over from the big bang how does one observe such string does it have thickness is this string any different then the strings that hypothetically make up elementary particles what is required to produce such large string why is this string so much bigger then others what happends if one tries to interact with this string can one stretch cut it etc can we have stable mega string on earth and can it be used for anything

6906 given recent events in japan this got me wondering is it possible to determine radiation levels reliably not having geiger counters near the possible radiation contaminated zone according to wikipedia the chernobyl disaster was first other than soviet union naturally detected by swedish via radioactive particles found on clothes of nuclear plant workers surely more efficient ways should have been developed by now
6908 my question might sound convoluted but my mind is twisting right now so my apologies in advanced why is it that when have one proton and one electron it is hydrogen clear flammable gas and when have say twelve it is carbon the driving force of life as we know it and then we end up with and we have uranium radioactive element how does the amount of protons affect what matter will be why does the amount of these particle things magically make one thing air and another cyanide if have one pebble it is pebble if have its just more of the same pebbles what makes protons different sorry this is so convoluted any reply is appreciated
6912 understand that information cannot be transmitted at velocity greater than speed of light think of this in terms of the radio broadcast the station sends out carrier frequencies omega but the actual content is carried in the modulated wave the sidebands omega pm omega the modulation envelop has its group velocity and this is the speed at which information is being transmitted we also know for example that rays in glass have phase velocity which is greater than the speed of light in vacuum my question is what exactly is it that is travelling faster than the speed of light edit know it couldnt be anything physical as its superluminal my problem is what is it that has absolutely no information content yet we associate velocity with it
6946 what does it mean to say that mass approaches infinity have read that mass of body increases with the speed and when the body reaches the speed of light the mass becomes infinity what exactly does it mean to say that the mass approaches infinity or becomes infinity am not able to get picture of infinite mass in my mind
6959 to focus this question let us consider first classical mechanics which is time symmetric given final condition and sufficient information one can calculate the system conditions of an earlier time retrodiction given quantum mechanics which is time symmetric and final condition what is the status of retrodiction in that theory without choosing between them here are three options an earlier condition can be determined probabilistically exactly as prediction can be an earlier condition can be determined exactly with enough accessible information from final condition it is inappropriate to use qm for retrodictions it is prediction only theory have seen some thought experiments on all this in penroses books but it remains inconclusive there and standard qm texts are not interested in retrodiction edit after answers thanks for the effort on this question which was challenging will continue to investigate it but some initial thoughts on the answers was expecting to receive comments on decoherence chaos and something on interpretations and such are amongst the answers perhaps the single most important sentence is peter shor the time asymmetry in quantum mechanics beween retrodiction and prediction comes from the asymmetry between state preparation and measurement luboss introduction of bayesian probability and response is the most useful although discussion of entropy does not seem immediately relevant this response though suggests different framework for retrodiction with an apriori set of assumptions introduced for the calculation of initial state complication that was not clearly enough addressed was the link with classical mechanics retrodiction statements that quantum retrodiction was impossible does not square easily with the fact that some will have corresponding classical systems easily retrodicted of course the fact that quantum prediction is probabilistic allows quantum retrodiction to be probabilistic too and thus different from classical retrodiction was not followed up in some answers as far as references to chaos is concerned does not retrodiction chaos result in an increase in ability to classically retrodict given that the trajectories will be converging on peter morgans points should say that the question is open to any interpretation of how the experimental apparatus is used if it is relevant to giving an appropriate answer then so discuss the significance on deepaks links should note that these include references to applications to this idea in quantum communication ie what was the sent state given received state think luboss probability is relevant here too feel free to edit your answers if you think of anything else
7008 are there any examples of common substances whose decay is not exponential were used to thinking about radioactivity in terms of half lives this is concept that makes sense only for decay that is exponential however there are plenty of physics articles on the subject of non exponential decay it seems to be theoretically ubiquitous for example the decay of unstable quantum states is an ubiquitous process in virtually all fields of physics and energy ranges from particle and nuclear physics to condensed matter or atomic and molecular science the exponential decay by far the most common type is surrounded by deviations at short and long times the short time deviations have been much discussed in particular in connection with the zeno effect and the anti zeno effect experimental observations of short and long time deviations are very recent difficulty for the experimental verification of long time deviations has been the weakness of the decaying signal but also the measurement itself may be responsible because of the suppression of the initial state reconstruction khalfin zurn eksp teor fiz english translation sov phys jetp fonda and ghirardi il nuovo cimento 7a physreva delgado muga garcia calderon suppression of zeno effect for distant detectors so are there any examples of deviations from long time decay if not then why not is the theory wrong or simply impractical and is there simple intuitive explanation for why long decays should not be exponential
7041 some threads here touching speed of gravity made me think about that this lead to some questions the speed of gravity was not measured until today at least there are no undebated papers to that effect it seems common knowledge belief among physicists that the speed of gravity is the same as the speed of light and this is my question is that speed of light speed of gravity result of gr or is that fed into the theory or is there some evidence from other sources than gr for this does the same speed imply some deep lying relation between gravity and electromagnetism
7043 imagine three light beams are sent to lens simultaneously they start at the same position but move towards the lens at different angles the first light beam passes the lens at its edge the second light beam passes exactly through its mid whilst the last light beam passes somewhere in between behind the lens there is screen at the focal point of the light beams which of the three light beams reaches the screen first assume they all reach it at the same moment but cant explain why its just my intuition thus hope somebody can help me out here thanks for answers in advance sorry for being inaccurate this is how the setup described should be like this http img6 imagebanana com img ahfdqbrn img jpg
7053 so know that when you collide particles with high enough kinetic energy kinetic energy at least the rest mass of the particles you are making you get particles how come potential energy cannot make particles say you have an electron held at potential such that the amount of potential energy it has equals at least the rest mass of particle you want to make how come potential energy does not convert into rest mass energy directly would this require whatever is creating the potential to disappear because the potential energy turns into particle this shouldnt violate any conservation of energy laws does it another question that kind of relates to my previous question is say we have kev photon what prevents this photon from turning into an electron that then has kinetic energy of kev
7060 so have learned in class that light can get red shifted as it travels through space as understand it space itself expands and stretches out the wavelength of the light this results in the light having lower frequency which equates to lowering its energy my question is where does the energy of the light go energy must go somewhere does the energy the light had before go into the mechanism thats expanding the space im imagining that light is being stretched out when its being red shifted so would this mean that the energy is still there and that it is just spread out over more space
7073 special relativity was well established by the time the schrodinger equation came out using the correspondence of classical energy with frequency and momentum with wave number this is the equation that comes out and looks sensible because this is of the form of wave equation like the one for sound etc except with an inhomogeneous term nabla psi partial tt psi frac mc hbar psi instead we have schrodingers equation which reminds of the heat equation as it is first order in time edit some thoughts after seeing the first posted answer what is wrong with negative energy solutions when we do freshman physics and solve some equation quadratic in say time we reject the negative time solution as unphysical for our case we do have reason why we get them like for the same initial conditions and acceleration this equation tells usthat given these iniial velocity and acceleration the particle would have been at the place before we started our clock since were interested only in what happens after the negative times dont concern us another example is if we have areflected wave on rope we get these solutions of plane progressive waves travelling at opposite velocities unbounded by our wall and rope extent we say there is wall an infinite energy barrier and whatever progressive wave is travelling beyond that is unphysical not to be considered etc now the same thing could be said about pm sqrt 2c mc that negative solution cant be true because particle cant have an energy lower than its rest mass energy mc and reject that if we have divergent series and because answers must be finite we say ahh these are not real numbers in the ordinary sense they are adics and in this interpretation we get rid of divergence iirc casimirt effect was the relevant phenomenon here my question boils down to this guess the general perception is that mathematics is only as convenient as long as it gives us the answers for physical phenomenon feel this is sensible because nature can possibly be more absolute than any formal framework we can construct to analyze it how and when is it ok to sidestep maths and not miss out crucial mystery in physics

7158 by what mechanism do quantum effects become observable in normal life at the macroscopic level for instance when two molecules collide is the momentum probabilistic event wherein the end state is not unique another example during chemical reaction it is probabilistic event at the quantum level whether or not any particular molecule within the solution interacts with another molecule
7172 was not able to find an answer for this question some radioactive elements have half life measured in thousands of years and some others even in millions but over billion years all the radioactive material that was part of the initial material that formed the planet earth should have decayed by now however there is still radioactive material with short half life to be found in nature how is this possible and if the answer is that the new radioactive material is constantly being generated somehow can you explain the mechanism of how this happens thanks
7184 there is no tunneling in the case of infinite potential barrier but there is when we have finite well in the classical analog in the first case we have particle bouncing between to infinitely rigid impenetrable walls and there is no tunneling same as the quantum case but if we have finite barrier means we have walls of finite rigidity say made of cork or something then the particle would just break through some of the cork and its probability of being found further in the cork wall will decay steadily can understand discrete energy levels being new thing because they behave like wave thats confined and not like particles confined but why tunneling
7202 was reading wikipedia which stated voyager 1s current relative velocity is km or kilometres per hour mph it travels away from sun so suns gravity must slow it down what propels voyager to that speed
7218 understand from basic conservation of energy and momentum considerations it is clear in classical electrodynamics that the fields should be able to have energy and momentum this leads to the usual poynting vector and energy density relations for electromagnetic fields however do not know how to interpret situations where there is net linear momentum in static electromagnetic field the fields arent propagating it doesnt make sense to me that momentum can be divorced from motion as concrete example to discuss consider massless string of length with spherical shell on each end with magnetic dipole moment and positive charge the radius of the sphere ll or alternatively consider the dipoles to be perfect point dipoles let the string be along the axis with one dipole at the origin and the other at if the magnetic dipole at the origin is oriented in the direction and the other dipole in the direction if you calculate the total linear momentum in the fields the answer is text em frac mu pi hat while this is an unstable equilibrium it is an equilibrium so classically the state can remain static with no need to evoke other external entities interactions etcetera so there doesnt seem to be any of the usual potential pitfalls to save us here please can someone explain how static field can have momentum
7231 recently there have been some interesting questions on standard qm and especially on uncertainty principle and enjoyed reviewing these basic concepts and came to realize have an interesting question of my own guess the answer should be known but wasnt able to resolve the problem myself so hope its not entirely trivial so what do we know about the error of simultaneous measurement under time evolution more precisely is it always true that for geq left xt right left pt right geq left x0 right left p0 right here argument denotes expectation in evolved state psit or equivalently for operator in heisenberg picture tried to get general bounds from schrodinger equation and decomposition into energy eigenstates etc but dont see any way of proving this know this statement is true for free gaussian wave packet in this case we obtain equality in fact because the packet stays gaussian and because it minimizes hup believe this is in fact the best we can get and for other distributions we would obtain strict inequality so to summarize the questions is the statement true if so how does one prove it and is there an intuitive way to see it is true
7232 does gr provide limit to the maximum electric field ive gotten conflicting information regarding this and am quite confused will try to quote exactly when possible so as not to confuse things more with my paraphrasing the author of the motion mountain physics textbook claims in his book there is limit and clarifies on his site that http www motionmountain net wiki index phptitle dislike page electromagnetic fields are limited in magnitude now every electromagnetic field contains energy and energy density is limited by general relativity if energy density is too high black hole appears the smallest possible black hole then leads to field limit if you deny an upper field limit you deny general relativity however general relativity has been confirmed in every experiment so far this sounds very obvious and intuitive to me however one of my physics tas got very upset when used this in thought experiment when discussing some limits in physics when told him the textbook got that from he looked it up and commented on the motion mountain wiki website his argument id like to add something here suppose for moment the energy density limit is correct then if an object is sped up until it length contracts enough such that the energy density is greater than this limit does it turn into black hole no quoting john baez the answer is that black hole does not form http math ucr edu home baez physics relativity blackholes black fast html the claim that if energy density is too high black hole appears is an incorrect oversimplification the issue is that in gr gravity depends on more than just the energy density component of the stress energy tensor so we cant just look at the relativistic mass to judge whether black hole forms it actually isnt even enough to look at the invariant mass for while the trace of the stress energy tensor for particle is just its invariant mass for an electromagnetic field it is identically zero even though electromagnetic fields curve spacetime in gr so none of these concepts of mass are sufficient when discussing gravity using gr especially when considering electromagnetic fields because gravity couples to the entire stress energy tensor hope this was helpful this makes much less sense to me and dont understand how energy density tending to infinity could ever avoid being black hole no offense to my ta but im skeptical as hes disagreeing with textbook author plus the authors response was that my ta is another einstein denier and not worth responding to so id like third partys answer on this does gr provide theoretical limit to the strength of an electric field is it best to just ignore my ta on this one
7250 my current understanding of gravitational lensing follows when star or other massive body passes between us and another star the phenomenon generally labeled gravitational lensing occurs the term gravitational lensing refers to the bending of light rays due to the gravitational influence of the massive body since the bends concentrate light for the observer they act like magnifying lens otoh but since was young have pondered other explanations for such observations one thought about what else might cause the observed effect is cloud of gas around the massive body itself the assumption being that any change in density between the thin gas of interstellar space and the thicker gas surrounding massive object should form refractive boundary in the case of an active star that gas might be the heliosphere of the star and for any massive object that is not creating an heliosphere it could be due to clouds of gas that the massive object is sucking in raised this idea with physics teacher in high school he assured me that any possible refraction from clouds of gas had been ruled out in observations of gravitational lensing never got to see papers on the subject so cannot confirm that and am not convinced my questions are does anybody know of papers on gravitational lensing that discuss the refraction from clouds of gas around the lensing body how could an observer experimenter go about quantifying the likely refractive index of such gas cloud
7251 if had light diode an object that only allowed light at least for range of frequencies to travel through it in one direction would this necessarily allow violations of the 2nd law of thermodynamics or would it be possible to restrict other properties of the device such that it could be okay why think it should violate 2nd law can place such devices at temperature in bath of thermal radiation at temperature such that it forms box which only lets the light in or out this would appear to always allow one to create thermal gradient once thermal gradient is formed useful energy can be extracted this seems to allow useful energy to always be extracted from thermal bath and thus give perpetual motion release one such device at temperature in bath of thermal radiation at temperature since the photons are absorbed or reflected in one direction and undisturbed in the other the device will start moving it can use thermal bath to directly generate useful motion why think im missing something and such device could potentially co exist with the 2nd law the above arguments seem valid if the diode was only partially rectifying as well however there exist sunglasses which largely reflect on one side but not from the other side researchers have succeeded in using meta materials to create blackhole for microwaves can anyone help sort this out

7437 once asked this question from my teacher and he replied because it passes light and why does it pass light asked and he said because it is transparent the same question again why glass is transparent why does light pass through it while for opaque objects it does not
7441 when was boy used to daydream about building tower so tall that the top of it would project into near space there would perhaps be zero gravity area in the penthouse where my friends and could bounce around and play space versions of various earth based games and sports in most excellent zero conditions much to my continued disappointment and despite all the technological advances of the last thirty or so years no one has built such structure can anyone explain the physical limitations constraints that are preventing someone from realising my fantasy of space tower update this kickstarter project seems to be pretty confident
7454 is there any reason why earths magnetic poles are so close to its axis of rotation or is it coincidence why does the earth have somewhat uniform magnetic field with two poles if you take bunch of random particles and put them together why should pole form on each side of this collection is it in practice possible to create device capable of canceling the earths magnetic field in region the size of the north sea this could help us control the wandering of certain unwanted crabs
7470 this is something probably very basic but was led back to this issue while listening to recent seminar by allan adams on holographic superconductors he seemed very worried to have theory at hand where the chemical potential is negative why for fermions isnt the sign of the chemical potential matter of definition the way we normally write our equations for the fermi dirac distribution the chemical potential happens to that value of energy at which the corresponding state has occupation probability of half and within this definition the holes in semiconductor have negative chemical potential it would be helpful if someone can help make statement about the chemical potential which is independent of any convention like one argues that negative temperature is sign of instability of the system also isnt it possible for fermions in an interacting theory to have negative chemical potential also if there is physical argument as to why bosons cant have positive chemical potential again can an interacting theory of bosons make difference to the scenario and how do these issues change when thinking in the framework of qft no one draws the qcd phase diagram with the chemical potential on the negative axis in qft does the chemical potential get some intrinsic meaning since relativistically there is finite lower bound of the energy of any particle given by its rest mass

7487 iodine is chemical element with symbol and atomic number there is currently lot of discussions regarding radioactivity in japan and iodine iodine has half life of days does it mean that people drinking radioactive water with iodine will lose half of it within days and thus the health risk would be lower and lower over time
7654 this question brachistochrone problem for inhomogeneous potential has the obvious extension namely the same question when gravity is treated according to general relativity to make it specific lets consider the case of schwarzschild metric given to points outside the event horizon what is the trajectory or the worldline of test body which goes from the first point to the second for least time all considered from the point of view of distant observer at rest with respect to the star back hole of course other metrics or the general case are also interesting couldnt find much by searching on the net there is one article with the tittle suggesting relevance actually more but this one seems very relevant but it is over pages of technicalities so it would be nice to see shorter answer
7657 im computer programmer that never studied physics in school and now its coming back to bite me bit in some of the stuff im being asked to program im trying to self study some physics and ive got few open source intro physics books and understanding it for the most part but im bit confused on this statement ive stumbled upon in section about static friction its already gone over the formula for static friction and so forth it gets into section explaining that the weight of train increases static friction between the wheels and the tracks alright makes sense but then it says this the reason locomotives are built to be so heavy is for traction the upward normal force of the rails on the wheels fn cancels the downward force of gravity fw so ignoring plus and minus signs these two forces are equal in absolute value fn fw given this amount of normal force the maximum force of static friction is fs sfn sfw this static frictional force of the rails pushing forward on the wheels is the only force that can accelerate the train pull it uphill or cancel out the force of air resistance while cruising at constant speed the coefficient of static friction for steel on steel is about so no locomotive can pull with force greater than about of its own weight if the engine is capable of supplying more than that amount of force the result will be simply to break static friction and spin the wheels newtonian physics light and matter book p158 crowell http www lightandmatter com bk1 pdf im confused as to how static friction is the only thing that can move the train forward thought static friction was what kept it in place in the first place theres another force that cant think of the name of but ive heard of somewhere that thought was more what theyre describing here where the weight of the wheels pushing down and forward slightly on the tracks causes the tracks to push up and forward from the opposite side can someone explain to me what this is saying
7663 or to put the question another way what is the result of proton positron collision or an up quark charm antiquark collision etc as far as know annihilation happens only between particles of opposite charge and same mass but perhaps am wrong and if the types of annihilation mentioned above cannot happen what are the reasons
7668 in dimensional analysis it does not make sense to for instance add together two numbers with different units together nor does it make sense to exponentiate two numbers with different units or for that matter with units at all together these expressions make no sense mathrm mathrm mathrm mathrm now my question is plainly this why do they not make sense why does only multiplying together numbers with units make sense and not for instance exponentiating them together understand that raising number with unit to the power of another number with unit is quite unintuitive however thats not really good reason is it
7680 there have been lot of sci fi shows recently using the rotating space station explanation for gravity on space stations after watching these videos http www youtube com watchv 49jwbrxcpjc nr http www youtube com watchv 36micus1ro was wondering what would happen if you were facing the direction of rotation while standing on the floor of rotating space station and tossed ball up from the video it looks like the ball should land in front of you is this in fact what would happen and if you dropped ball would it land behind you
7713 question illustrated procedure to forecast the decay rates of isotopes with known long average lifetimes lifetimes of the many isotopes vary from micoseconds to gigayears has only one stable isotope while sn has can standard model principles be used to predict the stability of isotopes and the average lifetimes for unstable isotopes or can this only be done by measurement
7738 at first thought its because of coriolis but then someone told me that at the bathtub scale thats not the predominant force in this phenomenon
7777 this is not question pertaining to interpretations after the last one realized should not open pandoras box for theories to be consistent they must reduced to known laws in the classical domains the classical domain can be summed up as hbar infty which is ok need to know however is that if qm is an independent and fundamental theory why does it rely so heavily on the classical formalism is it necessary for classical formalism to exist in order to have quantum formalism from as far as have read it does not seem so and find this puzzling suppose you have dissipative system or an open system when you cannot write an autonomous hamiltonian in the classical case how then do we approach these quantum mechanically when we cannot even write down the corresponding hamiltonian

7843 we re told that all forces are gauge forces the process seems to start with the lagrangian corresponding to particle type then the application of local gauge symmetry leading to the emergence of the force bosons via the associated symmetry group but where did exactly four forces come from could new perhaps supersymmetric particles hint at new fundamental forces is there deeper theory which predicts what final set of forces we ll eventually end up with finally is the concept of force in unified physics really that fundamental at all
7856 suppose you have semigroup instead of typical group construction in noether theorem is this interesting in fact there is no time reversal symmetry in the nature right at least not in the same meaning as with other symmetries rotation translation etc so why we construct energy as invariant of such kind of symmetry not using semigroup instead is is even possible there is plenty of references about lie semigroups looks like it is active field of mathematics is there any kind of noether theory constructed within such theories could you give any references to ideally introductory texts

7907 was reading landau and lifschitzs classical field theory and came across comment that the action for electromagnetism must be scalar not pseudoscalar footnote in section so was wondering is it possible interesting to construct classical field theory with pseudoscalar action if not why not note was motivated to look at this because of question from sean carrolls spacetime and geometry which asks us to show that adding pseudoscalar term vec cdot vec to the lagrangian doesnt change maxwells equations

7936 my physics teacher explained the difference between voltage and current using sandwiches each person gets bag full of sandwiches when they pass through the battery current the number of people passing through particular point per unit time voltage the change in number of sandwiches per person in parallel circuit the number of people current is divided between the two paths but the number of sandwiches per person voltage remains the same in series circuit the number of people passing through particular point remain the same but they drop off certain percentage of their sandwiches at every resistor therefore there is voltage drop that occurs between the points before and after every resistor this analogy naturally leads to the question how do the electrons know that they are going to have to share their voltage between two resistors before they reach the second one in other words not drop off all their sandwiches at the first resistor they find
7981 if search online for how radio telescopes work the found articles talk about how rf is on the spectrum etc how the parabolic collector is the aperture which contributes to the sensitivity and reflects the signals into the detector at the focal point then they skip to the signal processing circuitry the leads to rendered image they also mention that the furthest nodes in telescope array determine the virtual aperture of the array there are few parts dont understand how does the detector work from my reading it is merely an rf antenna cant think how youd get but one pixel per moment of detection that the telescope is positioned and begins listening and as the earth turns one scan line of image is captured for high resolution 2d image this would take thousands of passes this seems impractical as the earth is orbiting and time marches on otherwise perhaps multiple telescopes each take scan line and interlace the results but especially at such high resolutions cant see how youd engineer the huge machines with such precision please explain this to me do have the 1d scan line antenna idea wrong is it more like 2d ccd sensor in digital camera with the antenna just behind the focus of the dish if so assume the sensor would have to be 2d array of nanometer scale antennas this may be clear in the explanation but in laymans terns how are do telescope arrays work together to create the virtual aperture what is lost if any between the virtual and theoretical real aperture of equal size consider this physics question because understanding the answer to this real world application will help correct whatever theoretical misconceptions have about rf antennas and radio telescopes thanks
7993 suppose we have an atom with several energy levels an hydrogen and it is hit by photons know that in order to have the atom change energy levels the photon must have an energy level precisely equal to the energy difference of the two levels what happens if the photon has more energy than the ionization energy for the ground state the sum of the series of differences between consecutive levels it is not clear to me thanks
8034 given stream of random binary numbers is there any way to differentiate if they came from truly random or from formula algorithm how if there is no way to decide this then cant find any basis to keep denying that behind the truly random of quantum mechanics can be hidden algorithm know am talking about the posibility of hidden variables theory but cant find any other explanation is known that is possible to create computable normal numbers from which first is possible to extract an infinite random binary stream second it tell us that finite logic expression again binary stream can contain rational and even an irrational number so there is no big difference within bit stream and the measurement of random outcome and even less if we consider the accuracy say this because the argument that obtaining bits is not the same as answer the complex question that can be made to quantum experiments think that random results can be perfectly read from random stream of bits
8049 suppose stanford research systems starts selling two level atom factory your grad student pushes button and bang he gets two level atom half the time the atom is produced in the ground state and half the time the atom is produced in the excited state but other than that you get the exact same atom every time national instruments sells cheap knockoff two level atom factory that looks the same but doesnt have the same output in the ni machine if your grad student pushes button he gets the same two level atom the srs machine makes but the atom is always in superposition of ground and excited states with random relative phase between the two states the random relative phase between the two states of the ni knockoff varies from atom to atom and is unknown to the devices user are these two machines distinguishable what experiment would you do to distinguish their outputs
8062 why is the wave function complex ive collected some layman explanations but they are incomplete and unsatisfactory however in the book by merzbacher in the initial few pages he provides an explanation that need some help with that the de broglie wavelength and the wavelength of an elastic wave do not show similar properties under galilean transformation he basically says that both are equivalent under gauge transform and also separately by lorentz transforms this accompanied with the observation that psi is not observable so there is no reason for it being real can someone give me an intuitive prelude by what is gauge transform and why does it give the same result as lorentz tranformation in non relativistic setting and eventually how in this grand scheme the complex nature of the wave function becomes evident in way that dummy like me can understand wavefunction can be thought of as scalar field has scalar value in every point rt given by psi mathbb times mathbb rightarrow mathbb and also as ray in hilbert space vector how are these two perspectives the same this is possibly something elementary that am missing out or getting confused by definitions and terminology if that is the case am desperate for help one way have thought about the above question is that the wave function can be equivalently written in psi mathbb times mathbb rightarrow mathbb since wave function is complex the schroedinger equation could in principle be written equivalently as coupled differential equations in two real functions which staisfy the cauchy riemann conditions ie if psixt uxt vxt and and we get hbar partial frac hbar 2m partial 2v hbar partial frac hbar 2m partial 2u in if this is correct what are the interpretations of the uv and why isnt it useful am assuming that physical problems always have an analytic psirt
8074 made naive calculation of the height of earths equatorial bulge and found that it should be about 10km the true height is about 20km my question is why is there this discrepancy the calculation did was to imagine placing ball down on the spinning earth wherever place it it shouldnt move the gravitational potential per unit mass of the ball is hg with the height above the pole to center distance of the earth call that and gravitational acceleration gravity wants to pull the ball towards the poles away from the bulge it is balanced by the centrifugal force which has potential omega 2r sin theta per unit mass with omega earths angular velocity and theta the angle from the north pole this comes taking what in an inertial frame would be the balls kinetic energy and making it potential in the accelerating frame if the ball doesnt move this potential must be constant so hg frac omega sin theta textrm const we might as well let the constant be zero and write frac omega sin theta 2g for the earth 6m omega frac pi textrm hours this gives km when theta pi so the equatorial bulge should be roughly that large according to wikipedia the earth is km wider in diameter at the equator than pole to pole meaning the bulge is about twice as large as expected wikipedia cites diameter estimated radius where is the extra bulge coming from my simple calculation uses and as constants but neither varies more than percent or so its true the earth does not have uniform density but its not clear to me how this should affect the calculation so long as the density distribution is still spherically symmetric or nearly so wikipedia also includes an expression without derivation that agrees with mine
8149 lets assume two spherical particles and of finite radius and which are at locations pm frac distance apart at initial time these particles diffuse with coefficients and respectively how can obtain the probability distribution of the collision time that is if the time at which they collide is delta would like to know the probability density function of the random variable delta or at least some of its moments in these two cases when the domain is infinite mathbb and when it is bounded inside sphere with surface area and the origin as its center tried to look up for an answer in van kampens book but couldnt really come up with an answer
8151 in mathematics we talk about tangent vectors and cotangent vectors on manifold at each point and vector fields and cotangent vector fields also known as differential one forms when we talk about tensor fields we mean differentiable sections of some tensor power of the tangent or cotangent bundle or combination there are various natural differentiation operations such as the exterior derivative of anti symmetric covariant tensor fields or the lie derivative of two vector fields these have nice coordinate free definitions in physics there is talk of covariant derivatives of tensor fields whose resulting objects are different kind of tensor fields was wondering what is the abstract interpretation of the general notion of covariant derivative in terms of tensor products of tangent vectors and vector fields
8156 when finding the discrete energy states of operator have been taught to use the time independent schrodinger equation which restates the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors what don understand is why the eigenvalues are the energy states is there firstly mathematical reason and secondly physical reason does this arise from hamiltonian or lagrangian mechanics which am not familiar with
8221 when determining the gravitational attraction between solid bodies we can simplify computations by taking their masses to be concentrated at their respective centres of mass however had they been electrically charged bodies and we needed to compute electrostatic attraction there is no centre of charge notion available to us we would evaluate dimensional integral or equivalently apply gausss law is there any simple reason for the absence of such centre of charge frequently ive got the answer charge just doesnt work that way

8256 books such as mathematical methods of classical mechanics describe an approach to classical newtonian galilean mechanics where hamiltonian mechanics turn into theory of symplectic forms on manifolds im wondering why its at all interesting to consider such things in the classical case in more advanced theories of physics manifolds become relevant but in classical mechanics everything is euclidean and homogeneous so this isnt really needed there im wondering what motivated people to develop the theory of hamiltonian mechanics through the theory of symplectic manifolds one idea there wasnt really and physical motivation but someone noticed it and it was mathematically nice if this is the case then how did people notice it however maybe this theory was not developed until general relativity or quantum mechanics came about that is manifolds became relevant to more advanced physics and arnold thought it reasonable to teach students this manifold formalism in classical mechanics in order to better prepare them for more advanced physics but if this is true no one thought of using symplectic manifolds purely for reasons of classical physics

8295 was reading book on the history of quantum mechanics and got intrigued by the gendankenexperiment proposed by einstein to bohr at the 6th solvay conference in for context the thought experiment is failed attempt by einstein to disprove heisenbergs uncertainty principle einstein considers box called einsteins box see figure containing electromagnetic radiation and clock which controls the opening of shutter which covers hole made in one of the walls of the box the shutter uncovers the hole for time which can be chosen arbitrarily during the opening we are to suppose that photon from among those inside the box escapes through the hole in this way wave of limited spatial extension has been created following the explanation given above in order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy it is necessary to find way to determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with it at this point einstein turns to his celebrated relation between mass and energy of special relativity mc from this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides precise indication about its energy source bohrs response was quite surprising there was uncertainty in the time because the clock changed position in gravitational field and thus its rate could not be measured precisely bohr showed that the box would have to be suspended on spring in the middle of gravitational field after the release of photon weights could be added to the box to restore it to its original position and this would allow us to determine the weight the inevitable uncertainty of the position of the box translates into an uncertainty in the position of the pointer and of the determination of weight and therefore of energy on the other hand since the system is immersed in gravitational field which varies with the position according to the principle of equivalence the uncertainty in the position of the clock implies an uncertainty with respect to its measurement of time and therefore of the value of the interval question how can bohr invoke general relativity concept when quantum mechanics is notoriously incompatible with it shouldnt hup hold up with only the support of relativistic quantum mechanics clarifying bit what my doubt is was thought that hup was intrinsic to qm derived principle from operator non commutability qm shouldnt need gr concepts to be self consistent in other words if gr did not exist relativistic qm would be perfectly happy theory was surprised its not the case
8314 from surely you must be joking mr feynman you blast off in rocket which has clock on board and theres clock on the ground the idea is that you have to be back when the clock on the ground says one hour has passed now you want it so that when you come back your clock is as far ahead as possible according to einstein if you go very high your clock will go faster because the higher something is in gravitational field the faster its clock goes but if you try to go too high since youve only got an hour you have to go so fast to get there that the speed slows your clock down so you cant go too high the question is exactly what program of speed and height should you make so that you get the maximum time on your clock this assistant of einstein worked on it for quite bit before he realized that the answer is the real motion of matter if you shoot something up in normal way so that the time it takes the shell to go up and come down is an hour thats the correct motion its the fundamental principle of einsteins gravity that is whats called the proper time is at maximum for the actual curve how is this result proven

8622 summary this turned out to be rather trivial one indeed as marek mentioned in the comment the continuity equation is trivial and it indeed turns out be so godfrey miller elaborates on this showing that the continuity equation merely shows that the transition amplitude is constant with time all this is only confusing as long as you stick to the belief that the continuity equation is some exclusive indication of probability density rho psi psi is the probability density for transition from state to am having trouble interpreting the probability though dp leftarrow psi psi does this mean the probability in region of volume to go from state to state that does not make sense at all edit more or less agree with mareks answer however that makes it seem this is not the probability density how do we reconcile that with the fact that it satisfies the continuity equation if we have two states hbar partial psi frac hbar 2m nabla psi psi after making standard manipulations taking conjugate multiplying by conjugate subtracting we would get partial psi psi frac hbar 2mi nabla cdot left psi nabla psi nabla psi psi right this seems consistent with the continuity equation partial rho nabla mathbb however we seem to be changing its relation to the probability by making the probability int int rho rr rhorr 3r 3r instead of the regular int rhor 3r for kind of intuitive dimensional consistency can we instead say int int sqrt rho rho 3r 3r full steps psi and psi are two states of the same system both satisfy the se of the same potential taking the se for psi and multiplying by psi psi times left hbar partial psi frac hbar 2m nabla psi psi right taking the se for psi complex conjugating the entire equation and multiplying by psi left hbar partial psi frac hbar 2m nabla psi psi right times psi is real no decay processes etc on subtracting the second equation from the first partial psi psi frac hbar 2mi left psi nabla psi nabla psi psi right which is the same as partial psi psi frac hbar 2mi nabla cdot left psi nabla psi nabla psi psi right
8626 if system has degrees of freedom dof and therefore independent1 conserved quantities integrals of motion can continuous symmetries with total of parameters be found that deliver these conserved quantities by means of noethers theorem think this is not exactly the opposite of noethers theorem since dont ask whether for each conserved quantity symmetry can be retrieved ask about connection between the whole set of conserved quantities and symmetries or 2n or depending on definition and details that are irrelevant here but let me expand on it anyway consider the number of dofs equal to the number of initial conditions required to fully describe system in classical mechanics that means velocities or momenta are considered individual dofs and not that each pair of coordinate velocity make up only one dof time is no dof however it is parameter please discuss this in this question if you disagree

8663 in feynmans book quantum mechanics and path integrals feynman states that the probability pba to go from point at time to the point at the time is pba kba of an amplitude kba to go from to this amplitude is the sum of contributions phi xt from each path kba sum text paths from to phi xt the contributions of path has phase proportional to the action phi xt text const hbars xt why must the contribution of path be sim hbars xt can this be somehow derived or explained why cant the contribution of path be something else sim frac hbar sim coss hbar logs hbar or xt hbar edit have to admit that in the first version of this question didnt exclude the possibility to derive the contribution of path directly from schr dingers equation so answers along this line are valid although not so interesting think when feynman developed his formalism his goal was to find way to quantize systems which cannot be treated by schr dingers equation because they cannot be described in terms of hamiltonian the wheeler feynman absorber theory so think good answer would explain feynmans ansatz without referring to schr dingers equation because think schr dingers equation can only handle specific subset of all the systems that can be treated by feynmans more general principle
8673 in discussing relativity with somewhat mathematical friend the other day ran into problem showing why special and or general relativity could be considered as exact descriptions of reality rather than just approximations that are working okay so far heres his argument special relativity applies to situation where there is no curvature of spacetime since both matter and energy cause curvature the only situation where special relativity would apply would be one which has no matter and energy and therefore one which is not achievable in any experiment and even as thought experiment clock has to have mass and energy and so there can be no exact predictions in such theory he went on to say that therefore the general theory of relativity rests on very shaky foundation this is as compared for example to thermodynamics which rests comfortably on statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics related question special relativistic approximation to gr

8850 on the wikipedia article on the alcubierre drive it says since the ship is not moving within this bubble but carried along as the region itself moves conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation do not apply in the way they would in the case of ship moving at high velocity through flat spacetime relative to other objects and also this method of travel does not actually involve moving faster than light in local sense since light beam within the bubble would still always move faster than the ship it is only faster than light in the sense that thanks to the contraction of the space in front of it the ship could reach its destination faster than light beam restricted to travelling outside the warp bubble im confused about the statement conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation do not apply say bob lives on earth and jill lives on planet in andromeda and well say for the sake of argument that theyre stationary if were to travel from bob to jill using an alcubierre drive such that the journey would take me say week from my reference frame how long would jill have to wait from her reference frame do the time dilation effects cancel out altogether would she only wait week

8895 this is not the same as how many bytes can the observable universe store the bekenstein bound tells us how many bits of data can be stored in space using this value we can determine the number of unique states this space can be in imagine now we are to simulate this space by enumerating each state along with which states it can transition to with probability for each transition how much information is needed to encode the number of legal transitions and the probabilities does this question even make sense if so is there any indication that any of these probabilities are or are not computable numbers edit heres thought experiment select your piece of space and start recording all the different states you see if the bekenstein bound tells us we can store bits in our space wait until you see different states now weve seen all the states our space can be in otherwise we can violate the bekenstein bound for any state record any other state that the space can legally transition to without violating any physical laws to simulate this portion of space take its state and transition it to legal state repeat we have only used finite number of bits and we have modeled section of space

8922 astronomical telescopes are now mega projects and cost 1bn and although they are pitched to solve the current interest of the day they are general purpose machines and with upgrades and new instruments have life of perhaps 50years it seems that large accelerator projects are built to answer one question to find one particle but since the design must be based around the particle having particular energy and the cost and timescale being so large you have to be pretty damn sure that you expect the particle to exist and at the predicted energy it almost seems that if you had good enough estimate to build the accelerator then you dont really need to is something like the lhc one trick pony you turn it on and confirm the higgs or if not build bigger one is the lhc really more general purpose experiment but the higgs gets the press attention or is it just that the nature of discover in hep is different and you need to build single one shot experiment
8923 sorry if this is silly question if understand correctly for two atoms having the same number of protons is equivalent to being of the same element while having the same number of protons and the same number of neutrons equates to being of the same isotope of the same element but does having the same number of neutrons in itself have some significance in physics and what about having the same total number of protons and neutrons but not necessarily with the same summands
8926 see that it appears as constant in the relation for the running of the strong coupling constant what is its significance does it have to be established by experiment is it somehow scale for quark confinement if yes how ask because saw this in perkins particle astrophysics after kt fell below the strong quantum chromodynamics qcd scale parameter mev the remaining quarks antiquarks and gluons would no longer exist as separate components of plasma but as quark bound states forming the lighter hadrons such as pions and nucleons
8947 so was cruising around at youtube and saw this sweet video and as was watching started to wonder how is this possible for little bit of background in case you decide to not watch the video what is happening is an individual can hook out pack that sucks up water and then shoots the water downward this water jet levitation jetlev causes the rider to be able to fly upward into the air and move about forward backward side to side and even underwater you have to watch the video for that so my question is how exactly is this possible
8954 know that it is somehow related to the parton distribution functions allowing specific reactions with gluons instead of quarks and anti quarks but would really appreciate more detailed answers thanks
8981 have two part question first and foremost have been going through the paper by dijkgraaf and witten group cohomology and topological field theories here they give general definition for the chern simons action for general manifold my question is if anyone knows of any follow up to this or notes about their paper to those who know the paper they say that they have no problem defining the action modulo for bundle of order as cdot int trf wedge mod but that this has an fold ambiguity consisting of the ability to add multiple of to the action what do they mean here also later on they re define the action as left int trf wedge langle gamma ast omegab rangle right mod how does this get rid of the so called ambiguity basically my question is if anyone can further explain the info between equations and in their paper thanks
8983 the explanation have heard of the difference between static and dynamic friction is that static friction is stronger because bonds form when one object is put on top of another object and these have to be overcome to get the movement started for rotating tire although the point on the ground will be stationary for an instant it would seem that bonds wouldnt have time to form so why isnt the dynamic coefficient of friction used
9052 one of the things never understood but was too afraid to ask is this how should think of things like frac text kg text what exactly is square second square foot makes sense to me because can see it but square second ive always assumed its just one of those things youre supposed to deal with abstractly and not try to get an intuition for the same way you deal with dimensional space should just keep doing that or is there some bit of wisdom ive been deprived of all these years
9059 two questions assuming you dive head first or fall straight with your legs first what is the maximal height you can jump into water from and not get hurt in other words an meter fall into water is equivalent to how many meters concrete pavement fall force wise im assuming the damage caused will be mainly due to amount of force and not the duration assume you jump head first and hold sharp and strong long object that cuts the water before you arrive will that make the entrance to the water more smooth and protect you
9098 know outside nucleus neutrons are unstable and they have half life of about minutes but when they are together with protons inside the nucleus they are stable how does that happen got this from wikipedia when bound inside of nucleus the instability of single neutron to beta decay is balanced against the instability that would be acquired by the nucleus as whole if an additional proton were to participate in repulsive interactions with the other protons that are already present in the nucleus as such although free neutrons are unstable bound neutrons are not necessarily so the same reasoning explains why protons which are stable in empty space may transform into neutrons when bound inside of nucleus but dont think get what that really means what happens inside the nucleus that makes neutrons stable is it the same thing that happens inside neutron stars core because neutrons seem to be stable in there too
9106 what does it mean when we say that the cmbr is mostly gaussian what are non gaussianities in cmbr how does evaluation of point correlation functions of the inflaton field tells us that there is non gaussianity
9111 quantum fields are presented as operator valued distributions so that the operators in the theory are linear functionals of some test function space this works well for free fields giving us particular form for vevs in which the point connected correlation function determines the whole theory and trivial matrix for interacting fields however the vevs and the statistics of matrix observables that are predicted by the theory depend not only on the test functions generally given for the matrix in terms of pure improper wave number modes of the free field at pm infty but also on the energy scale of measurements one obtains different functional form at different energy scales the energy scales at which one is measuring are already encoded in the wave numbers associated with the test functions so it seems that the test functions play extra duty to determine the functional form of the vevs at least in their matrix form both by linearly smearing the quantum field and more indirectly by determining the renormalization scale as consequence the vevs the wightman functions seem clearly to be nonlinear functionals of the test functions for interacting qfts ive worried at this for while the argument as put brings into question the wightman axioms insistence that quantum field must be linear map from the test function space to the space of operators although suppose the effect would be only logarithmic in some measure of the frequencies of the test functions the haag kastler additivity axiom also seems problematic im not aware of weakening this particular aspect of the wightman or haag kastler axioms so as to be able to construct models of the axioms that parallel empirically successful qft having been discussed in the literature but have they note that dropping the linearity of the map from test functions to operators in the algebra of observables does not affect the linearity of the algebra theres still perfectly good probability interpretation of state over algebra and perfectly good hilbert space but the relationship of measurements to space time is somewhat modified edit ill attempt to make the question slightly more accessible it turns out that what follows makes it significantly longer the wightman functions effectively different name for vacuum expectation values vevs allow the reconstruction of wightman quantum field that is given the vacuum state over the algebra one can construct the wightman functions wx 1x left right hat phix hat phix hat phix left right but also given the wightman functions one can construct the algebra wightman functions satisfy somewhat arcane relationships so that just any function vvx 1x is almost certainly not wightman function and cannot be used to reconstruct wightman field the object hat phix is not an operator in the algebra of observables it is an operator valued distribution so that if we have well behaved test function fx where well behaved most often means that it is smooth infinitely differentiable and has smooth fourier transform then hat phi int hat phixfx mathrm 4x is an operator this is often called smearing with the test function fx the test function fx effectively tells us what relative amplification we apply to the field at each point in space time for given measurement and its fourier transform tilde fk tells us what relative amplification we apply to the field at each point in momentum space in signal analysis the same object is called window function which can be looked up on wikipedia one can talk about the bandwidth of measurement or say that signal transformation is high pass or low pass if it were not for non commutativity of measurement operators at time like separation quantum field theory would be exactly what one would want for mathematical formalism for modeling stochastic signal processing if one only talks about measurements that are space like separated admittedly tight constraint qft is stochastic signal processing formalism in contrast to hat phix hat phi is not singular mathematical object the difference is comparable to the difference between smooth function and the dirac delta function in terms of these operators the wightman functions become wf 1f left right hat phi hat phi hat phi left right which is linear in all the test functions when we move to the practical formalisms of interacting qft however the vevs predicted by the bare theory are infinite renormalization fixes that in lorentz invariant way but it leaves the vevs function of the energy scale mu of the measurements that are involved in an experiment thus one finds that the wightman functions are now function of mu as well as of the points mux 1x or in terms of operators muf 1f its perhaps worth noting that we dont know whether these mu satisfy the relationships required for them to be wightman functions so that we could reconstruct wightman field but ive never seen discussion of perturbative qft conducted in such terms the wightman functions in terms of positions do not encode energy scales but they are not observables they are only template for constructing observables the fourier transforms of the test functions tilde ik however already determine various energy scales at which the measurements made in an experiment operate potentially in much more detail than single number mu we could just say that the energy scale of measurements mu is separate from the energy scales determined by the test functions but it seems more natural to me to say that mu is functional of the test functions in which case we can write wf 1f muf 1f where is now non linear functional of the suppose we expect to be symmetric function of each of the for more or less trivial example suppose we have two ordinary quantized klein gordon fields hat phi and hat xi not necessarily having the same mass spectrum then we could construct quantum field hat phi hat phi hat xi epsilon where the square is fx so that hat phi satisfies microcausality so that hat phi mathcal rightarrow mathcal hat phi mapsto hat phi is nonlinear map from the test function space into the algebra of observables this is still gaussian field so not interacting already there start to be significant complications one of the most fundamental wightman axioms is the restriction to positive spectrum which in terms of test functions is projection to forward light cone components of the test functions only components of tilde fk for which alpha is in the forward light cone have any effect on measurement results in the above however forward light cone components of 2x contribute which in fourier space where 2x is convolution means that negative frequency components of fx will contribute although this means that this kind of nonlinearity apparently does not satisfy positivity of the energy its not clear that this means such system is not stable which is the non axiomatic reason why we insist on positivity of the energy as an axiom which whoops brings into question positivity of the energy one of the big axioms which asked about here now of course im trying out doing research here as if it was virtual blackboard many of the ideas above ought to be rubbed out different ideas tried and equally or more vigorously discarded ive got lots of pieces of paper that have discarded ideas on them that you dont want to see because hope you have your own discarded ideas as anyone who doesnt get too fixed in their ways should most of which probably dont want to see not that im not little fixed in my ways but ive discarded some ideas the trouble is that cant see how we can go forward from me just typing away think the feedback loop may be too long for this to work still the alternative is to write paper and get feedback six months later this introduces questions that may try to put on meta by the way making question favorite counts for no reps but its much appreciated
9183 once quantum partition function is in path integral form does it contain any operators the quantum partition function is tre beta where is an operator the hamiltonian of the system but if put this into the path integral formalism so that we have something like int bar gamma gamma int beta tau frac hbar gamma partial bar gamma bar gamma partial gamma bar gamma gamma is the bar gamma gamma an operator thanks
9221 imagine there are two cars travelling straight at the speed of light and is following directly behind suddenly switches on its headlights will be able to see this light my answer is no since the light will always stay stationary relative to this will probably lead to it gathering up and intensifying realize this is impossible but its question my grade honours teacher asked so we dont need to get into relativity frac sqrt cough cough think
9255 we know that point charge located at the origin produces potential sim frac and this is consistent with the fact that the laplacian of frac is nabla frac pi delta vec my question is what is the laplacian of frac at the origin is there charge distribution that would cause this potential
9296 we are all told at school water vapour and carbon dioxide are the top two greenhouse gases and that they absorb thermal infra red radiation trap heat and warm up the earth my question is how do they do that why cant oxygen or nitrogen or any other gas not absorb infra red radiation as well as water vapour or co2
9300 the ising model is well known and well studied model of magnetism ising solved the model in one dimension in in onsager obtained the exact free energy of the two dimensional 2d model in zero field and in yang presented computation of the spontaneous magnetization but the three dimensional 3d model has withstood challenges and remains to this date an outstanding unsolved problem
9302 think saw in video that if dark matter wasnt repulsive to dark matter it would have formed dense massive objects or even black holes which we should have detected so could dark matter be repulsive to dark matter if so what are the reasons could it be like the opposite pole of gravity that attracts ordinary matter and repulses dark matter
9314 why is the speed of light defined as why did they choose that number and no other number or phrased differently why is metre of the distance light travels in sec in vacuum
9325 machs principle says that it is impossible to tell if something is accelerating unless there is something else in the universe to compare that motion to which seems reasonable however if you had one detector in the universe you seem to be able to tell if it is accelerating because an accelerating detector would record radiation where non accelerating detector would not due to the unruh effect so my question is does the unruh effect provide way to tell if something is accelerating even if it is the only thing in otherwise empty space thereby violating machs principle at least machs principle in its form stated above
9349 im having trouble doing it know so far that if we have two hermitian operators and that do not commute and suppose we wish to find the quantum mechanical hermitian operator for the product ab then frac ab ba however if have to find an operator equivalent for the radial component of momentum am puzzled it does not come out to be simply frac vec cdot frac vec frac vec cdot vec where vec and vec are the position and the momentum operator respectively where am wrong in understanding this
9415 we all learn in grade school that electrons are negatively charged particles that inhabit the space around the nucleus of an atom that protons are positively charged and are embedded within the nucleus along with neutrons which have no charge have read little about electron orbitals and some of the quantum mechanics behind why electrons only occupy certain energy levels however how does the electromagnetic force work in maintaining the positions of the electrons since positive and negative charges attract each other why is it that the electrons dont collide with the protons in the nucleus are there ever instances where electrons and protons do collide and if so what occurs
9421 recently found out this strange article about nuclear decay rates somehow showing seasonal variations with high correlation with sun activity has this been experimentally confirmed disproved an experiment using neutrinos from fission reactor would be awesome although probably couple orders of magnitude below the required luminosity at least to be comparable with solar sources could the standard model possibly allow neutrinos to modulate decay rates in this way or do we need new physics link to the public version of the paper another paper about this but now the superkamiokande data is compared with data from brookhaven http arxiv org abs they also propose model of the effect called neutrino resonant spin flavor precession
9482 why is the angle of wake of duck constant and why are some conditions on the water depth necessary realize that this question turns up in google searches but did not see good discussion will be quite happy with link edited to add could anyone tell me how the two up voted answers are related
9574 have quick question that just came up in my research and could not find an answer anywhere so thought id try here so one of the definitions of the dirac delta is the limit of the lorentzian function with epsilon going to zero see here http hitoshi berkeley edu 221a delta pdf for the expression on the first page my question is can define the dirac delta just as well with this deltat lim epsilon rightarrow frac pi frac epsilon epsilon where have included an extra epsilon in the numerator my hunch is that this is no problem since the limiting behavior looks the same to me
9615 was reading some information about the power blackout in the northeastern us beginning early in the afternoon of august big transmission lines began to fail in first energys operating area several because the utility had not kept up with tree trimming so that as heavily loaded lines heated up they sagged into brush and shorted out as one went down the next would become too loaded sag still more and short and so on all that the result of serious infringement of operating standards and no small matter in its own right would have remained local problem if first energy and the midwestern power regulator had quickly recognized what was going on and had promptly cut service to enough customers to keep the whole system from getting overloaded from coal power ban is necessity coal ed michael logan aug what about overheating causes power lines to sag understand that increasing the load on the line will increase the lines temperature due to the resistance in the cables why does this increased heat cause the lines to sag though
9616 after watching some ants in my garden today and then looking at this very illuminating demonstration got to wondering about what they would see not specifically ants understand their eyesight is quite poor but similarly small or even smaller creatures guess im asking more about the nature of light and how photons are reflected off very small surfaces would very small creature like say an ant with vision be able to see something as small as single coli bacterium or virus would their world look the same as ours or does the viewers relative size have bearing on the quality of their perception and additionally beyond the realm of reality if could shrink myself down to the size of bacterium could see atoms

9665 if have container that is full of water and attempt to freeze the water by freezing the container what would happen if the container is strong enough to prevent the water expansion could the water be in liquid state even though it is at or below freezing point this is probably daft question but its something thats been bugging me
9683 in nutshell noethers theorem states that for every continuous symmetry corresponding conserved quantity exists now the hamiltonian equations of motion lets talk about classical system here are invarinat under addition of any constant to the hamiltonian function rightarrow text const is there corresponding conserved quantity
9686 the action int mathrm is an important physical quantity but can it be understood more intuitively the hamiltonian corresponds to the energy whereas the action has dimension of energy time the same as angular momentum ive heard the action being described as measure of change although dont know how this description can be justified
9708 wanted to know that if fire is matter or energy know that both are inter convertible but that doesnt mean there is interconversion taking place just like nuclear fusion or fission if it is matter then its has to occupy space and have mass really doubt that fire has mass if it is energy then dont get it please enlighten me from my ignorance
9720 on quantum scale the smallest unit is the planck scale which is discrete measure there several question that come to mind does that mean that particles can only live in discrete grid like structure have to magically jump from one pocket to the next but where are they in between does that even give rise to the old paradox that movement as such is impossible zenos paradox does the same hold true for time that it is discrete with all the ensuing paradoxes mathematically does it mean that you have to use difference equations instead of differential equations and sums instead of integrals from the point of view of the space metric do you have to use discrete metric the manhattan metric instead of good old pythagoras thank you for giving me some answers and or references where can turn to update just saw this call for papers it seems to be quite topic after all is reality digital or analog fqxi essay contest call for papers at wayback machine all essays winners one can find some pretty amazing papers over there
9727 pioneer are robotic space probes launched by the nasa in the early 1970s after leaving our solar system an unusual deceleration of both spacecrafts has been measured to be approximately ddot frac with respect to our solar system several attempts were made to explain this tiny effect called the pioneer anomaly but none was fully accepted in the scientific community so far two months ago frederico francisco et al have proposed another solution to the problem they assume roughly speaking that the thermal radiation of the spacecraft caused by plutonium on board along with the actual structure of the probes is responsible for this mystery of modern physics here an image of pioneer taken from wikipedia along with sketch of the radiation model employed in the paper hence my question is the pioneer anomaly finally explained sincerely
9751 let us say block of mass is placed on the surface of earth then while drawing the forces on that body we say force mg acting towards the center of earth normal reaction offered by the surface of earth if no other forces are acting we say but what about the centrifugal force omega 2r why dont we ever bring that into picture what am missing
9773 why are these states called as such and how do they differ vaguely understand that when you obtain scattering state but when you have bound state
9800 if see the steam coming out of cooling towers at an altitude of meters cannot help but think that this energy is wasted my question is why isnt this steam cooled enough to become water and used to create hydroelectric power due to the drop from meters
9814 found pair of polarizing 3d glasses lying around and tried to look at myself in the mirror while wearing them to my utter confusion when closing the left eye and only looking through the right eye could not see the right eye in the mirror the light could not pass through the same polarized lens twice could however see the closed left eye clearly would expect the opposite to be true as light going out the right lens with polarization and coming back in with the same polarization should pass through unaffected
9842 if say particle with energy approaches finite potential barrier with height and happens to tunnel through where would the particle be during the time period when it is to the left of the potential barrier and to the right of the potential barrier surely there must be finite amount of time for it to travel through to the other side unless it simply teleports there if it travels through with energy less than however doesnt that mean it cannot enter in the region of the potential barrier
9876 imagine point like particle can only experience the local properties of spacetime but locally there is no curvature and no gravity as it is often stated that locally as expressed in the equivalence principle spacetime is minkowskian and the laws of physics exhibit local lorentz invariance wikipedia general relativity but if this is the case how does point like particle know which direction it should follow in gravitational field can this be seen as hint that point like particles cannot be used as underlying concept for field theory like general relativity
9899 matt in his answer on what does hexagonal sun tell us about the camera lens sensor mentions incidentally the number of distinct points to the star is equal to double the total number of unique orientations in the sides of the aperture shape three blades would be six points six blades would also be six points as hexagon has only three unique orientations in its sides hexagonal aperture has six sides but only three unique orientations as there are three pairs of parallel sides think it makes sense to have three pointed star in case of three blades but how does six blade aperture also result in three pointed star
9969 learned that moving charge creates magnetic field perpendicular to its direction of motion also learned that charged particles like electrons have spin and they also create magnetic field because of their magnetic dipole moment dont understand what magnetic dipole moment is and cant find decent explanation for it by using google first can someone please explain magnetic dipole moment arising from spin in an effective way second is my main question does magnetic field arise from moving charge or from its spin or both third am very confused think am mixing together the classical electrodynamics description of magnetic field moving charge with quantum mechanics description of magnetic field magnetic dipole moment due to spin

10052 ive read on nasas page on neutron star that one teaspoonful of that star would weigh over billion tonnes on earth if it was somehow possible to bring it to earth would it burn and disappear during earth atmosphere entry assuming we have billion tonnes of mass occupying the volume of teaspoon here on earth would it fall through the ground under its own weight
10055 continuing from my first question titled simple quantum mechanics question about the free particle part1 griffiths goes on and says fixed point on the waveform corresponds to fixed value of the argument and hence to and such that pm vt constant or mp vt constant what does this mean am so confused he goes on and says that psixt might as well be the following psixt ikx hk 2mt because the original equation psixt ikx hbar 2mt ikx hbar 2mt only differs by the sign in front of he then says let run negative to cover the case of waves traveling to the left pm sqrt 2me hbar then after trying to normalize psixt you find out you cant do it he then says the following free particle cannot exist in stationary state or to put it another way there is no such thing as free particle with definite energy how did he come to this logical deduction dont follow can someone please explain griffiths statement to me
10089 would like to know what happens with time dilation relative to surface at earths center there is way to calculate it is time going faster at center of earth ive made other questions about this matter and the answers refers to delta phi difference in newtonian gravitational potential between the locations as directly related but think those equation cant be applied to this because were derived for the vecinity of mass but not inside it any clues thanks
10161 is there good chance that gravitational waves will be detected in the next years theoretical estimates on the size of the effect and the sensitivity of the newest detectors should permit forecast on this
10184 this url lists the mass of copper as and this other url lists the mass as these values differ by almost exactly which seems hard to explain by experimental error why is it that these values differ in significant digit but have the same less significant digits is one of them typo of the other what is the correct value what is the origin of both of these values this discrepancy was noted by commentators in this article about supposed cold fusion reactor according to those commentators this value is relevant to the cold fusion debate because it makes all the difference as to whether or not the supposed reaction is energetically feasible the linked article concerns the same cold fusion claim discussed in this previous physics se question edit user9325 voix and user3673 have indicated that the correct answer is have started bounty on the origin of both the correct and incorrect values
10230 operators can be cyclically interchanged inside trace rm tr ab rm tr ba this means the trace of commutator of any two operators is zero rm tr ab but what about the commutator of the position and momentum operators for quantum particle on the one hand rm tr xp while on the other hand xp hbar how does this work out
10262 the topic of lattice qcd or lattice gauge theory or even lattice field theory is quite old now and the main reason for the interest in the topic is the ability to calculate nonperturbative stuff on computer it seems that to do research with lattice you need an access to some supercomputer but now everyone can afford something that is as powerful as supercomputers years ago maybe it possible to redo some of the results of that time is there any project that is relatively simple allows to calculate some real world quantity like mass of the proton can be done with an average home computer
10308 this question is motivated by this xkcd comic strip the problem is indeed interesting and my first recollection upon reading this was similar problem in the book problems in general physics by irodovwhich in my humble opinionis masterpiece the question wanted to ask is are there any generalizations of the problem known can be find the resistance between any two nodes of the grid as function of the distance between the nodes many thanks in advance
10311 im looking for software or software package for example that can simulate lot say thousands at least of molecules in action ie in movement or attached to say static walls have found several but they seems to be either gas only water only or not really scientific lot of small balls dodging around moved by an unique formula
10362 read that the non commutativity of the quantum operators leads to the uncertainty principle what dont understand is how both things hang together is it that when you measure one thing first and than the other you get predictably different result than the measuring the other way round know what non commutativity means even the minus operator is non commutative and think understand the uncertainty principle when you measure one thing the measurement of the other thing is kind of blurred and vice versa but dont get the connection perhaps you could give very easy everyday example with non commuting operators like subtraction or division and how this induces uncertainty and or give an example with commuting operators addition or multiplication and show that there would be no uncertainty involved
10410 if stand exactly in front of colorful wall imagine the light waves they emit and they receive should randomly double or erase out each other so as result imagine should see weird combination of colors or full black full white very lightly perception of the wall when all the light waves that the wall receives and emits cancel out each other or double each other why doesnt that actually happen any time look into wall never see the wall cancel out of my perception same for radio waves shouldnt radio waves not work at all there are so many sources where they could reflect and cancel out or annoy each other

10433 its announced that researchers at imperial college london has found that the electron is almost perfect sphere the popular articles all have nice photo of billiard ball etc it is reported that they found this by measuring the wobble as the electron spins and finding none what does it exactly mean that the electron is sphere is it the wave function that is spherical measuring the spin wobble brings to mind solid object which think the electron surely isnt so what would have been wobbling if it didnt have perfect spherical symmetry
10463 ive read it many places that amplitude modulation produces sidebands in the frequency domain but as best as can imagine it modulating the amplitude of fixed frequency carrier wave just makes that louder or quieter not higher frequency or lower frequency that is believe could sketch on graph paper path of wave function that touches peak or trough exactly every increments regardless of the volume why do the sidebands appear
10464 often ill be driving down the road on summer day and as look ahead toward the horizon notice that the road looks like theres puddle of water on it or that it was somehow wet of course as get closer the effect disappears know that it is some kind of atmospheric effect what is it called and how does it work
10470 when the sun is out after rain can see what appears to be steam rising off wooden bridge nearby im pretty sure this is water turning into gas however thought water had to reach degrees to be able to turn into gas is there an edge case for small amounts of water perhaps that allows it to evaporate

10565 when you release magnetic dipole in nonuniform magnetic field it will accelerate understand that for current loops and other such macroscopic objects the magnetic moment comes from moving charges and since magnetic fields do no work on charges perpendicular to it follows that the work done on the dipole that caused its gain in kinetic energy must have come from somewhere other than the magnetic forces like electric forces in the material however what about pure magnetic moment im thinking of particle with intrinsic spin of course such thing should be treated with quantum mechanics but shouldnt classical electrodynamics be able to accommodate pure magnetic dipole if so when release the pure dipole in nonuniform field and it speeds up what force did the work is it correct to say that magnetic fields do do work but only on pure dipoles not on charges or should we stick with magnetic forces never do work and the work in this case is done by some other force what thanks to anyone who can alleviate my confusion
10572 why does the sound of thunder last several seconds even when lightning lasts for only fraction of second
10582 maybe another stupid question but whats the energy of graviton is it hbar omega does it emit gravitons when an apple falls onto the ground like photons be emitted when an electron transits from higher energy level to lower one
10606 are there any references that present the explicit variation of the hilbert einstein action plus the hawking gibbons york boundary term and demonstrate the cancellation of the normal derivatives of metric variations have tried to read the original papers by york and gibbons hawking but they are not that pedagogical to me
10615 im tutor this is high school level problem in high school every one have might have solved problem of effective resistance of ladder of resistors having infinite steps now the problem is little different what if it has steps instead of infinite steps how to calculate effective resistance in that case
10635 enjoy reading up on new topics in physics and astronomy and learning the concepts and ideas in the major theories like relativity and quantum mechanics unfortunately one thing that lack completely and envy others for is the mathematical understanding would like to start studying the mathematics as well from newtonian gravity to more advanced problems but was wondering what the best progression of topics would be how should learn the mathematics of physics know that there are other questions on how to learn physics and apologize if this seems like duplicate however dont think that the mathematics have specifically been addressed in previous questions
10674 what is the best way to focus sunlight using flat mirrors my goal is to start fire cutting the mirrors is easy
10690 are there any analytical proofs for the 2nd law of thermodynamics or is it based entirely on empirical evidence
10695 find the functioning of laser rangefinder confusing the explanation usually goes like this you shine laser beam onto the object the laser beam gets reflected and gets back to the device and time required for that is used to calculate the distance okay but the object surface can be uneven and not perpendicular to the laser beam so only tiny fraction of beam energy is reflected back to the device and theres plenty of other radiation around sunlight included how does rangefinder manage to see that very weak reflected signal in reliable manner
10701 im software developer and need to calculate the estimated amount of force expended typing stored text preferrably in some interesting way the force exerted on keys thus far is enough to push car miles or equivalent to kg of tnt assumptions were not going to worry about deletes or moving the cursor or anything im just counting characters of stored text dont really care if the space requires more force or not this is more of fun fact than anything from what ive found online the mean force required for keystroke is about 9n source hundreds of millions of characters have been typed questions what is good way to make this something people can relate to how can calculate it thank you all in advance for your valuable time and input edit thought my original post would make this pretty clear realize only have the force required to push each keystroke im looking for way to demonstrate that force applied to something to help people quantify it hypothetical energy in terms people can understand
10710 cant seem to figure out the relationship between and or understand that the units are pretty different but for example bullet with mass of 0g is moving at the speed of 1000m bull with mass of 400kg is charging at the speed of 00m which has the greater kinetic energy 5000j for the bullet and 5000j for the bull that worked fine but now if you calculate momentum you get kg cdot for the bullet and kg cdot for the bull which does not make sense does the bull hit harder than the bullet or the same amount as the bullet
10756 other than one having positive invariant scalar product and the other negative one what are the actual physical differences between these vectors
10759 looking at the relevant wikipedia page one can read that the graviton should be massless is it certain that it is massless or is there room in any nonstandard models for tiny non zero mass which could lead to similar surprise as the detection of the neutrino oscillation such that the graviton if it exists could maybe selfinteract and form something like graviballs my present knowledge of gr and qft is at the demystified level
10773 read recently that if you hold bullet in one hand and pistol in the other both hands at the same height and subsequently fired the pistol at the same time as dropping the bullet both bullets would hit the ground at the same time assuming the fired bullet encounters no obstacles is this true and if so can you explain the reasoning behind it with as few equations as possible assume it is essentially that gravity is unaffected by momentum but it just sounds counter intuitive
10827 from high school remember that aluminium has electrons and thus has an unpaired electron in the 3p shell this should make aluminium magnetic however the wiki page of aluminium says its non magnetic at one placewith citation needed tag though and at another place says its paramagnetic doing google search shows up some contradictory results so what is the truth note the context of the question is this answer on scifi se about magneto
10829 intent not looking to make up something seek explanations which are possible to duplicate description of phenomenon the halved side of the bubble would be horizontal to earths surface and the bowl shape would be closer to the ground image of shape not the bubble itself heres steel version of the bubbles shape related physics heres the best explanation ive found related to the physics know to relate to the issue we consider half of the soap bubble the forces on the hemisphere will be the surface tensions on the two circles and the net force from the excess pressure between the inside and the outside of the bubble this net force is the sum of all of the forces perpendicular to the surface of the hemisphere but must be parallel to the surface tension therefore we can find it by finding the force on the circle that is the base of the hemisphere the total force must be zero so we have rg r2 which gives 4g source and related image current status im out of possible reasons why this would happen except for one that being that any half bubbles observed might in fact be whole free floating bubble with three walls two of which are refracting near zero light while the third is highly refractive the three walls form single sphere divided in half by single wall meaning that theres top hemisphere and lower hemisphere and the dividing wall would this be possible background this phenomenon is based on question saw years ago posted on another physics community forum im unable to locate that page but ive searched for it on that page more than three3 people had independently observed the phenomenon which to me gives some validity to it existence in some form that or someone was just having fun and gaming the forum
10863 consider this explanation of the alpha decay it says the coulomb barrier faced by an alpha particle with this energy is about mev so by classical physics it cannot escape at all quantum mechanical tunneling gives small probability that the alpha can penetrate the barrier the explaining sentence and the attached picture suggest that the alpha particle has to overcome the coulomb barrier in order to escape and as is hasnt enough energy to do that it must tunnel through it but the coulomb force is repulsive force in this case as both the nucleus and the alpha particle are positively charged so why is there any coulomb barrier at all shouldnt the coulomb force help the alpha particle to escape the other way round its obvious the particle wants to enter the nucleus but it is hindered by the repulsive force but when it wants to leave the nucleus it is only retained by the nuclear force as far as can see why does the alpha particle have to go trough the coulomb barrier or am just misinterpreting the explanation and the tunneling occurs somewhere else
10956 im little familiar with the physics and thermodynamics of the wind chill effect but this question seems to come up from time to time why given two temperature sensors or thermometers in the same environment do both report the same temperature if one is exposed to wind when the other is shielded from it people often ask because the temperature reported by for example their vehicle doesnt seem to change as they drive at different speeds etc other than of course the changes from one actual temperature to another as they change geography my understanding is that inert devices arent endothermic like we are so the effects of wind chill dont apply can you explain this in laymans terms
10989 this might sound like the silliest question ever but can someone shed some light on what is actually happening in the following situation there is an asteroid in outer space what is rotating with high speed there is an astronaut standing on its surface does the astronaut feel lighter compared to if the asteroid wasnt rotating can he jump higher compared to if the asteroid wasnt rotating what happens if the astronaut makes big jump vertically is he going to land on the exact same place or the asteroid could rotate under the jumping astronaut

11017 im very new to quantum mechanics im thinking of writing quantum computer simulator would the following work each qubit is stored as single bit for each operation the qubits involved are transformed into complex vector of amplitudes of size this will result in vector containing 0s and one this vector is multiplied by the unitary matrix representing the operation the resulting vector is squared element wise an outcome is picked using the elements of the result as probabilities and the qubits are set according to this outcome im not concerned with the running time or the memory cost of the algorithm what am concerned about is whether this would result in physically accurate simulation
11039 the quark composition of the neutral pion pi is frac bar bar sqrt what does this actually mean think its bizarre that particle doesnt have definite composition theres difference of mev between the quark masses and dont understand how this can be ignored if were to somehow manage to make bound state of an up and an anti up quark what would it be would it be variation on the neutral pion or would it somehow transform into the mixture
11050 im studying vector analysis and it is hard for me to understand what divergence of vector field really is know that divf nabla cdot but dont understand what kind of quantity it gives and what it is used for could anyone give me good example of what it is used for in real physics
11054 assuming only newtonian gravity suppose that the universe consists of an infinite number of uniform planets uniformly distributed in two dimensional grid infinite in both directions and not moving relative to each other is there any reason to believe that this is not an equilibrium state friend of mine who knows much more applied maths than me assures me that this system is not in equilibrium but im unable to find any evidence for this want to be able to say that the net force on each planet in the grid is zero we approach this by summing the forces exerted on planet by each other planet over the whole space but note that we can pair off the other planets that exert equal and opposite forces on to show that the total sums to zero am going mad for bonus points presumably the same result holds for any number of dimensions to the grid

11241 this is thought asked myself often but never did real efforts to get an answer barsmonsters question about number of fans of wind turbine made me think of it again why do blades of aircraft propellers or wind turbines cover only small fraction of the area they circle propellers of ships or kaplan turbine propellers cover almost the entire circle independent of number of blades same for steam turbines and jet turbines am shure that the forms of those propellers are very close to optimum due to decades of experience
11264 for an observable and hamiltonian wikipedia gives the time evolution equation for at iht hbar iht hbar in the heisenberg picture as frac dt at frac hbar frac partial partial from their derivation it sure looks like frac partial partial is supposed to be the derivative of the original operator with respect to and frac dt at is the derivative of the transformed operator however the wikipedia derivation then goes on to say that frac partial partial is the derivative with respect to time of the transformed operator but if thats true then what does frac dt at mean or is that just mistake need to know which term to get rid of if is time independent in the schrodinger picture think its frac partial partial but you can never be too sure of these things
11321 im far from being physics expert and figured this would be good place to ask beginner question that has been confusing me for some time according to galileo two bodies of different masses dropped from the same height will touch the floor at the same time in the absence of air resistance but newtons second law states that with the acceleration of particle its mass and the sum of forces applied to it understand that acceleration represents variation of velocity and velocity represents variation of position dont comprehend why the mass which is seemingly affecting the acceleration does not affect the time of impact can someone explain this to me feel pretty dumb right now

11449 is mass converted into energy in exothermic chemical nuclear reactions my level knowledge of chemistry suggests that this isnt the case in simple burning reaction mathrm to co energy is released by the mathrm bonds forming the atoms lose potential energy when they pull themselves towards each other in the same way that falling object converts gpe to ke there are the same number of protons electrons etc in both the reactants and products would have assumed that this reasoning extends to nuclear fission fusion as well but one physics textbook repeatedly references very small amounts of mass being converted into energy in nuclear reactions so just wanted to know if was wrong about either of these types of reactions and if so what mass is lost exactly
11453 was watching few sci fi movies and was wondering the real science explaining what would happen if you were to be subject to the conditions of outerspace read the wikipedia article on space exposure but was still confused if person was about the same distance from the sun as earth is would they still freeze to death as shown in the movie sunshine im reading from all sorts of sites with conflicting information about what would actually happen when person is exposed to the vacuum of space
11500 im trying to understand the units in mx kx and the general solution is xt cos omega sin omega let omega sqrt frac the unit for the spring constant is kgms or nm where is in kg so that the units of omega seem to be per second but later we put omega in to the cos and sin functions which will return dimensionless ratios so the constants ab must be in since is in what dont understand is why my book says omega has the unit rad get that the input for cosine is rad or some other angle measure but where did the radians come from my analysis of units only proved as the actual units have just been informed that radians are dimensionless so that answers part of this question yet still dont know why we cant say that dimensionless one in degrees or rotations how do know what kind of cosine and sine table to use with this dimensionless number
11506 as the question in the title states am wondering what material can be effectively used to shield gamma rays apart from lead believe concrete is often used but it is nowhere near as effective as lead cm to match cm of lead as understand it also hear significant bodies of water helps as does tightly packed dirt but surely there must be other materials that shield nearly as effectively as lead
11527 as of this writing it has been made clear to me that classical physics luminiferous aether was terriblly poor discriptor of space with the advent of special relativity and general relativity that aether ceased to be applicable today began reading on the higgs boson and the higgs field how are those theories different from or similar to the seemingly irrational luminiferous aether am first year student at bakersfield community college if this question seems naive you now have an explanation edit to me the similarity rests upon their fundamental influences regarding static positions in space currently only accept models in which static spacial positions are impossible contrastingly relative positions seem quite reasonable in my humble opinion my naivatisms inhibit me from absorbing and understanding the higgs boson if they actually are similar public protest would probably be more apparant however have put forth my best effort to pose an direct question here the questions where does space go when it falls and what happens to time lost when matter accelerates come much earlier in my studies and they seem relevant
11542 why is the gravitational force always attractive is there another way to explain this without the curvature of space time ps if the simple answer to this question is that mass makes space time curve in concave fashion can rephrase the question as why does mass make space time always curve concavely

11646 read that thermodynamic entropy is measure of the number of microenergy states what is the derivation for log where is boltzmann constant number of microenergy states how is the logarithmic measure justified does thermodynamic entropy have anything to do with information entropy defined by shannon used in information theory
11675 it has been said that the electron is the fundamental representation of the poincare group with only two conmuting observables sigma mu this question regards what is usually called the superselection rules what dont understand why states that are superpositions of different like overline and electron and positron superposition are supressed and how what about superpositions like mu an electron and muon and finally why neutrino flavors are different and in this regard can be mixed in superposition what about superpositions of particles with different mass what are the currently accepted mechanisms for this supression are there other alternatives worth pursuing are there high decoherence impedances in some state combinations that make them decohere quicker than others or are they fundamentally supressed
11707 was visiting the australian synchrotron earlier today as part of tour group as the guide was going over the booster and storage rings was reminded of something learnt of quantum if know my quantum well enough every so often there are spontaneous pairs of electrons and positrons created and destroyed everywhere now know that they dont last very long but got to thinking what would happen if pair was created at just the right instant for the positron to collide with one of the super high energy electrons in the booster or storage ring of synchrotron when asked our guide he said that the probability was pretty low since there were only 1x10 electrons in there and naturally the pair would have to generate at just the right spot at just the right time ultimately he wasnt quite sure what would happen if the circumstances were correct for it though have been doing some further thinking if remember correctly these pairs form as an electron spiralling in towards central positron think that therefore at ordinary energies any nearby electrons would be repelled by the electron around the positron which is little reminiscent of the atomic stuff of first year chemistry question is could an electron at the sorts of energy levels of the order of giga electron volts get past the spiralling electron and collide with the positron instead of its paired electron doing so as this energy could not simply vanish would you then get lonely now unpaired electron and an explosion or would the energy somehow transfer itself to the other electron my interest here is towards what would actually happen if all circumstances were just right also appreciated would be anyone who might be able to tell me the theoretical frequency of electron positron pairs being spontaneously generated as well as helping me to think up way of determining the probability of finding an electron within one of the rings for instance perhaps if electrons can be considered to have an effective volume within which they are most likely to appear and comparing that to the volume of the ring thanks for your time really appreciate it

11799 currently am stuck trying to derive the self inductance of long wire according to literature it should be frac mu mu 0l pi and in literature its derived by looking at the energy of the magnetic field tried to derive this formula via the magnetic flux and am getting pi instead of pi this are my considerations wire with radius and length the magnetic flux density br is given according to amperes law br pi mu mu frac br mu mu frac pi where is the distance from the center of the wire is its radius and is the total current through the wire now know that the magnetic flux phi through the upper part of longitudinal section is phi int da int brl dr frac mu mu ril pi where is the wires length no use phi li and arrive at pi what am doing wrong where is the mistake in my considerations moreover have the following problem if look at an entire longitudinal section of the wire and not only at its upper half the magnetic flux is zero 2r magnetic flux is zero the magnetic field penetrating the upper half of the longitudinal cross section is exactly opposite to the magnetic field penetrating the lower half hopefully formulated my problem clear enough if not please ask me for further details
11800 there have been recent questions about the vacuum in my simplified knowledge the vacuum is like ground state energy level and also that there might even exist other lower energy levels than the vacuum we find ourselves in the sea is soup of created and annihilated pairs of virtual particles with virtual energies and momenta in normal sea on earth which also represents ground state of water energy can be taken out of random waves by the clever construction of valves that allow only one way motion of water is it conceivable that gadget of similar function could be found for the vacuum sea or is it forbidden by conservation laws my intuition tells me that it might be possible if gr is taken into account but my physics knowledge does not stretch to support this edit an explanation of why am asking this question let me expand on the example of the sea the energy from the waves comes from either tides gravitational forces or wind temperature differentials if these were missing the oceans would be like glass representing unique ground state of the gravitational well of the earth in an analogy gravitational wave going through the vacuum would be supplying energy to the vacuum sea have been thinking of this analogy ever since cold fusion surfaced and refuses to die out the most recent one being discussed here too approached from nuclear physics orders of magnitude the claims seem preposterous there are people though who believe they have results of extra energy over input energy much more than chemical reactions could supply this set me thinking on vacuum energy and the analogy with getting energy from the sea crystal is prime candidate for any exploration of such concepts and in all cold fusion successful results crystals have been used now if the effect depended on the vacuum and how much distorted it was by passage of gravitational wave at the time of the experiment or the exact orientation of the crystal or the type of impurities in the crystal centers etc one would expect to get haphazard results and non repeatable by other experimenters of course this would be the first experimental evidence of gravitational waves edit maybe should clarify that an acceptable answer in the negative would be one based on conservation laws believe that data trumps theory and next in line are conservation lawsbecause they are the distillation of an enormous amount of data some people seem to think that theoretical definitions can substitute for proof in physics but physical theories change solid data do not and this is physics not axiomatic mathematics
11803 in npr news story from few years back gamma ray burst from about billion light years away has become the most distant object in the known universe im layman when it comes to physics so cut me some slack if this is an ignorant question but assuming the universe is around 14b years old and has been expanding since the big bang how is it that we can see events so far back in time understand how it would work if you had static universe and the grb happened 13b years ago at 13b light years away and the light just arrived however at the time of the burst wouldnt we or at least the matter that we are made from have been much closer to the source of that burst and wouldnt the light have blown by us eons ago how is it we are seeing it now if we were expanding away from it at close to light speeds it would seem to make sense for why it took so long for it to get here except for that whole notion that light moves at the same speed relative the to the observer which think would blow that idea out of the water perhaps gamma rays travel at sub light speeds but id still think the math would require that they travel much slower than light for this scenario to play out another possibility is that the light has wrapped around finite universe few times before reaching us of course if that were the leading theory there wouldnt be any remaining controversy about the finite vs infinite universe models what am missing here
11806 im mathematician with hardly any knowledge of physics before start reading volumes of physics books have few questions that have been bugging me and that will help me start reading physics lets forget quantum mechanics for the purpose of the discussion and focus on relativity always fail to understand what the objects are and how to relate them intuitively to perceivable space and time what are the objects heres what mean we begin with spacetime being pseudo riemannian manifold with some metric is this metric assumed to be locally lorentzian for each point in this manifold there should be some parameters right like whether theres particle there what particle is it information that includes for example mass is there magnetic field there and so forth together this pseudo riemannian manifold with pre specified metric and with set of parameters for each point is what described the universe in relativity right what precisely are those parameters in general relativity
11820 know that if we solve the maxwell equation we will end up with the phase velocity of light being related to the permeability and the permittivity of the material but this is not what im interested in want to go deeper than that we know that the real speed of light is actually not changing the decrease in speed is just apparent material is mostly empty the light will still travel with in the spacing the rare atoms will disturb the light in some way so am interested in how the atoms affect the light photon absorption emission theory some textbooks that read explain it in way kind of like this in material the photons are absorbed by atom and then re emitted short time later then they travel short distance to the next atom and get absorbed emitted again and so on how quickly the atoms in material can absorb and re emit the photon and how dense the atoms decides the apparent speed of light in that material so the light appears slower because it has smaller drift speed interference theory but recently realize an alternative explanation atoms respond to the light by radiating electromagnetic wave this new light interferes with the old light in some way that results in delayed light advanced in phase this can easily be shown by using simple phasor diagram consequently effectively the light covers smaller phase each second which gives the impression of lower phase velocity however the group velocity is changing in complicated way think that the first explanation does not explain the change in phase velocity of light if we consider light travelling into slab of negative refractive index non dispersive material let say the light is directed perpendicular to the slab the phase velocity direction will be flipped but group velocity direction in the material will not change only the second explanation can explain the flipped phase velocity direction guess that the velocity that we get in the first explanation is actually belongs to the group velocity it makes sense to me that the front most of the photon stream determines the first information that the light delivers so the question is what really cause the phase velocity of light to be decreased drift velocity of photons they arent the same photons they are re emitted all the time phase difference between absorbed and emitted light something else and also still dont really understand detailed explanation of the absorption emission process for small lights wavelength for large lambda compare to the atoms spacing the photons will be absorbed by the phonons the dispersion relation that we know is continuous and also some material is non dispersive therefore the absorption process must occur in all frequency for certain range so definitely it doesnt involve the atomic transition otherwise it will be quantized my guess is that the relevant absorption process gets smooth out by the dipole moment what makes the spectrum continuous edit link for dispersion relation http refractiveindex info group crystals material si

11878 found sean carrolls no nonsense introduction to general relativity about page here pdf here page overview of the topic very helpful for beginning study it all got me over the hump of learning the meaning of various terms associated with gr most of which had heard before without understanding it also outlined the most important examples is there similar document for quantum field theory which presents the main equations briefly describes the main ideas and summarizes the most important applications and results so that the reader can feel the lay of the land before studying in depth
11881 im wondering why the weak interaction only affects left handed particles and right handed antiparticles before someone says because thats just the way nature is let me explain what find needs an explanation in the limit of massless fermions chirality handedness becomes helicity vec cdot hat now helicity is property of the state of motion of an object in space it is pretty unobvious to me how the internal symmetry su2 times u1 would know about it and be able to distinguish the two different helicity states of motion on more technical level iirc left and right handed spinors are distinguished by their transformation properties under certain space time transformations and are defined independent of any internal symmetry if we want to get the observed parity violating behavior we have to plug in factor of gamma explicitly into the lagrangian is there any reason this has to be like this why is there no force coupling only to right handed particles why is there no gamma term maybe it exists at more fundamental level but this symmetry is broken
11882 so there appears to be quite bit of misinformation on the web as to why people should stay in their cars during thunderstorm so id like to clear some things up one such non nonsensical answer is that cars have rubber tires which insulate you from the ground believe this contributes little to nothing to the actual reason the correct answer appears to be because the car acts like faraday cage the metal in the car will shield you from any external electric fields and thus prevent the lightning from traveling within the car however what happens if you have an imperfect faraday cage around you say for example you had window open think the car would still protect you because it still acts as faraday cage albeit bit not perfect and because electrons will travel the path of least resistance which would be through the body of the car and not through you now going with my reasoning wouldnt you be just as safe standing next to giant conductive pole lightning rod wouldnt the lightning just go through the lightning rod and youd be safe also side question lightning is essentially just an huge electric arc from the clouds to the ground correct

11940 from my understanding of light you are always looking into the past based on how much time it takes the light to reach you from what you are observing for example when you see star burn out if the star was light years away then the star actually burnt out years ago so am years old if was light years away from earth and had telescope strong enough to view earth could theoretically view myself being born

12046 observation so know that all computer screens are able to project many different colors by varying how they display the rgb red green blue pixels question whats the difference between say yellow light nm from sunlight vs the same yellow light thats displayed on the computer screen arent they different is our brains mixing together the rgb lights together and its being interpreted as yellow light or is yellow light the same nm light that comes from sunlight actually hits our eyes relationship between fourier series and light so know that in fourier series you have basis functions sines and cosines that make up any other function depending on the coefficients that are in front of the sines and cosines terms know that rgb colors on screen are the basis for all the other colors that computer screen makes up and the intensity of each of the rgb are like the coefficients so am making the correct relationship here
12089 few days ago was soldering small thing which contained diode battery and some other useless things unfortunately soldered the diode reversed and it didnt work when reversed it again it started to light was trying to find an answer in google but the only thing could find was the fact that electricity in diode can flow only in one direction but my question is why how does it work is this fact connected with the construction of diode

12169 by the no hair theorem three quantities define black hole mass angular momentum and charge the first is easy enough to determine look at the radius of the event horizon and you can use the schwarzschild formula to compute the mass angular momentum can be found using the cool little ergosphere penrose discovered however dont know how to determine the charge of the black hole how can an electromagnetic field escape the event horizon of reissner nordstr black hole is there any experiment we could theoretically do to black hole to determine its charge
12183 here in this forum and elsewhre read about charged black holes what is the background for this questions is this more question of theroretical interest in practice black holes should be neutral because matter is neutral globally star is charged little bit depending on surface temperature and plasma physics in corona but this charge will be blast away with surface material when the interior of the star collapses to form black hole again when black hole eats matter from around charge separation might occur but only to limited extent until the voltage developed would cancel the separation mechanism as in case of star

12200 why is electricity not transmitted wirelessly such that we dont need to span cables on the earths surface as in electricity is transmitted wirelessly from the power plant to the household
12208 the book im reading about optics says that an anti reflective film applied on glass makes the glass more transparent because the air film and film glass reflected waves originated from paraxial incoming wave interfere destructively with each other resulting on virtually no reflected light therefore the extra light that would normally get reflected gets transmitted instead to honor the principle of conservation of energy suppose however this answer states that superposition is the principle that the amplitudes due to two waves incident on the same point in space at the same time can be naively added together but the waves do not affect each other so how does this fit into this picture if the reflected waves actually continue happily travelling back where does the extra transmitted light come from the film is described as having an intermediate index of refraction between those of air and glass so that both the air film and film glass reflections are hard produce inversion in the phase of the incoming wave and having depth of of the wavelength of the wave in the film so that the film glass reflection travels half its wavelength back and meets the air film reflection in the opposite phase thus cancelling it
12286 consider that we have two balls one white and one black and two distant observers and with closed eyes we give the first ball to the observer and the second ball to the observer the observers dont know the exact color state of their balls they know only the probability of having one or another color until they look at them measure if the observer looks at his ball he will see its color which is white so he immediately knows the color of the second ball lets call this classical entanglement my question is what is the difference between this classical entanglement and the quantum entanglement for example of two entangled electrons with opposite spins states can this analogy be used to explain the quantum entanglement

12341 one can define the poincare group as the group of isometries of the minkowski space is its lie algebra given either by the equations to as also given in this page https en wikipedia org wiki poincar c3 a9 group or equations to of weinbergs volume of his qft books what confuses me is that in deriving the commutation relations between mu nu and mu he did use quantum theoretic arguments about the hilbert space operator but guess there is nothing quantum about the lie algebra he derives in the aforementioned equations is that right this quantum confusion steepens when one looks at the relativistic boost along the th spatial direction linear momentum along the th spatial direction commutator being non zero this is justified by saying that the exponential action of the boosts and the translations on the hilbert space states do not commute and that is being reflected here they pick up an extra phase proportional to the mass and the dot product of the boost velocity and the displacement vector but if the afore mentioned equations are really the lie algebra of the isometry group of the minkowski spacetime then in the galilean limit shouldnt they be instead reflecting the fact that galilean boosts and translations when acting on the spacetime coordinates do infact commute but the and commutation continues to be non zero even when the galilean limit is taken on page this makes me strongly suspicious that the equations to are not the lie algebra of the isometry group of the minkowski spacetime but are the lie algebra of the group whose elements are lambda using weinbergs notation right so is the low velocity limit taken on page recovering non relativistic quantum theory and not newtonian physics on page of the same book he derives the topology of the inhomogeneous lorentz group as being times times since this is connected manifold guess that by the term inhomogeneous lorentz group he is meaning only the proper orthochronous component of the full relativistic symmetry group right cant see how the above topology matches with the semidirect product structure for posibly the same thing as given on this wikipedia page http en wikipedia org wiki poincar group when people talk of the poincare group is the full symmetry group of relativity is what is being referred to or is it just its proper orthochronous component and not the other components am familiar with the notion of central charge as in the first term on the rhs of the tt ope of cft what also has the interpretation as the zero point energy when doing the plane minus point cylinder conformal transformation in this light it is not clear to me as to what is meant when one says that one can add in the mass as central charge to the galilean group an extra generator which commutes with all the rest so that with this central extension the free particles will lie in the unitary representations of the galilean group rather than the projective representations before the extension would be grateful if someone can shed light on this issue and help reconcile the two different notions of central charge when one takes low velocity limit of the poincare algebra to get the galilean algebra then is one taking just non reltivistic limit or is one also taking non quantum limit guess this will depend on my first query about whether what weinberg calls as the poincare algebra in the quoted equations has any quantum effect encoded in it as it seems to be or is it just the lie algebra of the isometry group of the minkowski spacetime

12435 whats the cleanest quickest way to go between einsteins postulates of relativity physical laws are the same in all inertial reference frames constant speed of light light is always propagated in empty space with definite speed which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body to minkowskis idea that space and time are united into 4d spacetime with the indefinite metric ds vec dx dt related to the question of what is the best derivation of the correspondence are is the correspondence does the correspondence go both ways and are there any hidden extra assumptions edit mareks answer is really good suggest you read it and its references now but not quite what was thinking of im looking for an answer or reference that shows the correspondence using only mainly simple algebra and geometry an argument that smart high school graduate would be able to understand
12444 ive been seeing many feynman diagrams lately that cant quite interpret yet ive heard basic quantum field theory lecture and so to me feynman diagram is simply mnemonic picture to quickly write down and remember all of the possible terms in the perturbation series of the matrix element in scattering but they seem to be much more than that consider for example this diagram of proton neutron scattering via pion exchange the picture seems to have an intuitive meaning but how can it be valid feynman diagram wouldnt that imply that there is an underlying theory with proper lagrangian from which feynman rules can be derived that would assign number to this diagram question when describing nucleon nucleon interactions in this way do people actually write down lagrangian and derive those rules am confused because ive seen diagrams like that in several books and they usually write down the cross sections simply from analogy arguments to other theories any clarification will be greatly appreciated
12462 in astrophysics often come across the speed of sound understand that broadly it represents the speed at which perturbations travel through medium but theres more than one speed of sound the most common seem to be isothermal and adiabatic which are defined as dp rho and dp rho respectively my question is when do these different speeds apply when do perturbations travel at the adiabatic sound speed and when the isothermal are there any other useful sound speeds

12611 from what remember in my undergraduate quantum mechanics class we treated scattering of non relativistic particles from static potential like this solve the time independent schrodinger equation to find the energy eigenstates there will be continuous spectrum of energy eigenvalues in the region to the left of the potential identify piece of the wavefunction that looks like ae ikx omega as the incoming wave ensure that to the right of the potential there is not piece of the wavefunction that looks like be ikx omega because we only want to have wave coming in from the left identify piece of the wavefunction to the left of the potential that looks like ikx omega as reflected wave identify piece of the wavefunction to the right of the potential that looks like ikx omega as transmitted wave show that interpret frac as the probability for reflection and frac as the probability for transmission this entire process doesnt seem to have anything to do with real scattering event where real particle is scattered by scattering potential we do all our analysis on stationary waves why should such naive procedure produce reasonable results for something like rutherfords foil experiment in which alpha particles are in motion as they collide with nuclei and in which the wavefunction of the alpha particle is typically localized in moving volume much smaller than the scattering region

12657 have noticed that when microwave an ice cube it appears to melt more slowly than would expect for example an equal volume of water starting at deg would probably be at boiling point before an ice cube that was at deg had melted realize there is enthalpy of fusion to take into account in the melting process but believe there is more to it than that as understand it microwave oven works by exciting the water molecules in whatever is being cooked and if memory serves the frequency used is one that causes rotation of the molecule since the ice cube is solid im assuming the molecules arent free to rotate and therefore the microwaves have much reduced effect in fact im wondering if perfect single crystal of water would respond at all to being microwaved does this sound right ive been trying to rack my brain for way of testing this theory but cant think of way of getting an perfectly dry ice cube into microwave to see if anything happens even tiny amount of surface water caused from interaction with warm atmosphere would encourage melting

12744 if you have two magnets not in contact and then put non magnetic object in between the two magnets does that decrease the attraction repulsion between the two magnets it seems that it wouldnt because if it would then you could allow two magnets to attract each other then put an object in between before they came in contact and then be able to pull them apart again without having to put in as much energy as you would have to if the object had not been put in you would get free energy in the sense of free lunch can anyone confirm this

12785 read paper on solving schrodinger equation with central potential and wonder how the author get the equation2 below full text in griffithss book it reads frac phi leftv frac frac ll right phi phi they are quite different can anyone explain how to deduce equation2
12805 this phys se question asks why and how the speed of light is constant would like to ask related almost converse question given that the speed of light is constant how could explain to young earth creationist who is still proponent of the disgraced barry setterfield decay theory that the decay theory contradicts observed physical reality as described and understood by all scientists including those in the physics and astronomy fields surely variable speed of light would throw monkey wrench into all sorts of fundamental laws or systems in physics surely it would be measurable on instruments today if there was even miniscule change in the speed of light relative to continuous cold caesium fountain atomic clock the fact that there is no observable change in any recent trustworthy data is the beginning middle and end of the scientific argument am correct my physics education ended at grade so im asking for high school level explanation also wonder if decay theorists are contradicting themselves or have sawn off the branch upon which they themselves sit for example wonder this would we have to modify our expectations of what the doppler effect red shift would look like as light comes towards us from distant stars if the speed of light is variable would we not have to throw all our doppler data out and all the distances themselves if the speed of light is variable in some undefined way and thus unknown and unknowable the decay theory was spawned because redshift data indicates that the stars are too far away for their light to have reached us in the mere years the universe has existed in short if decay theory exists to explain distant stars to young earth creationists and help them breathe sigh of relief wouldnt it be slightly less scientifically bogus to just dispute the doppler effect and the distance of those stars
12806 actually cant expand much as the question pretty much explains the query would be interested in the method of estimating an answer as well as potential way to measure it experimentally thanks im not sure what tags to include for this one for those that can feel free to edit them as you see fit
12841 suppose have two waves emanating from point source the waves start out completely in phase is the coherence length consistently defined as the length at which these two waves achieve phase difference of radian that seems arbitrary to me you could easily choose phase difference of frac pi im kind of lost on this whole topic of wave coherence to be honest id appreciate someone giving an overview for the example of two standard plane waves with full mathematical description
12973 imagine take polymer like polyethylene of length with some number of kuhn lengths and tie into into trefoil knot what is the difference in entropy between this knotted polymer and circular polyethylene unknot is there an approximate way of calculating this for knots of given crossing number or other topological invariant such as jones polynomial
12983 my field of study is computer science and recently had some readings on quantum physics and computation this is surely basic question for the physics researcher but the answer helps me lot to get better understanding of the formulas rather than regarding them as is whenever read an introductory text on quantum mechanics it says that the states are demonstrated by vectors and the operators are hermitian matrices it then describes the algebra of vector and matrix spaces and proceeds dont have any problem with the mathematics of quantum mechanics but dont understand the philosophy behind this math to be more clear have the following questions and the like in my mind all related to quantum mechanics why vector hilbert spaces why hermitian matrices why tensor products why complex numbers and different question when we talk of an dimensional space what is in the nature for instance when measuring the spin of an electron is why and not what does it mean is the answer just because the nature behaves this way or theres more profound explanation
13043 from wikipedia the energy catalyzer is an apparatus built by andrea rossi and sergio focardi the patent application claims method and apparatus for carrying out nickel and hydrogen exothermal reactions with production of copper although the patent cites previous works on cold fusion one statement by rossi asserted that it is not cold fusion but rather lenr low energy nuclear reaction according to focardi the hydrogen is heated at given temperature with simple resistor when the ignition temperature is reached the energy production process starts the hydrogen atoms penetrate into the nickel and transform it into copper are these claims true
13060 in log plots quantity is plotted on logarithmic scale this got me thinking about what the logarithm of unit actually is suppose have something with length mathrm km log log mathrm km it seems that the unit of log is log mathrm km but can also say mathrm and now log log mathrm this doesnt appear to have any units at all this suggests that log mathrm km and log mathrm are actually dimensionless numbers but wait can do this with any unit does it actually make sense to talk about the logarithm of unit or some other function for that matter
13157 there was reason why constantly failed physics at school and university and that reason was apart from the fact was immensely lazy that mentally refused to believe more advanced stuff until understand the fundamentals which eventually never did as such one of the most fundamental things in physics that still dont understand year after dropping out from the university is the concept of field no one cared to explain what field actually is they just used to throw in bunch of formulas and everyone was content the school textbook definition for field electromagnetic in this particular case but they were similar as remember it goes like an electromagnetic field is special kind of substance by which charged moving particles or physical bodies with magnetic moment interact special kind of substance are they for real this sounds like the authors themselves didnt quite understand what field is so they decided to throw in bunch of buzzwords to make it sounds right im fine with the second half but special kind of substance really bugs me so id like to focus on that is field material apparently it isnt it doesnt consist of particles like my laptop or even the light if it isnt material is it real or is it just concept that helps to explain our observations while this is prone to speculations think we can agree that in scope of this discussion particles actually do exist and laws of physics dont the latter are nothing but human ideas so suspect universe doesnt know thing about them at least if were talking raw matter and dont take it on metalevel where human knowledge being part of the universe makes the universe contain laws of physics any laws are only product of human thinking while the stars are likely to exist without us homo sapiens messing around or am wrong here too hope you already see why hate physics is field not material but still real can something not touchable by definition be considered part of our universe by physicians used to imagine that snapshot of our universe in time would contain information about each particle and its position and this wouldve been enough to deseralize it but guess my programmer metaphors are largely off the track oh and know that the uncertainty principle makes such deserialization impossible only mean that thought the universe can be defined as the set of all material objects in it is such assumption false at this point if fields indeed are not material but are part of the universe dont really see how they are different from the whole hindu pantheon except for perhaps more geeky flavor when talked about this with the teacher who helped me to prepare for the exams which did pass by the way it was before dropped out she said to me that if wanted hardcore definitions field is function that returns value for point in space now this finally makes hell lot of sense to me but still dont understand how mathematical functions can be part of the universe and shape the reality im afraid the question will seem ambiguous and get closed but had really hard time trying to shape my confusion into sentences and will highly appreciate if someone clears it up suggests link or confirms that there is no definitive answer to my question
13237 in mathematical derivations of physical identities it is often more or less implicitly assumed that functions are well behaved one example are the maxwell identities in thermodynamics which assume that the order of partial derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials is irrelevant so one can write also it is often assumed that all interesting functions can be expanded in taylor series which is important when one wants to define the function of an operator for example hat sum infty frac hat are there some prominent examples where such assumptions of mathematically good behavior lead to wrong and surprising results such as an operator hat where cannot be expanded in power series
13245 after some reading on dimensional analysis it seems to me that only rational exponents are considered to be more precise it seems that dimensional values form vector space over the rationals my question is why do we restrict ourselves to rational exponents while its true that have never seen physical equation with irrational exponents is there any real guarantee that it will never occur what are the benefits of such restriction
13263 as noted in how can quasar be billion light years away from earth if big bang happened only billion years ago the wiki about quasars still contains the following misleading sentence the highest redshift quasar known as of june is ulas j1120 with redshift of which corresponds to proper distance of approximately billion light years from earth but even if the strange billion is replaced by the correct billion the fact remains that the actual measurement is redshift of the proper distance is only different way to express that measurement its not clear to me how accurately this describes the distance of the quasar because the quasar surrounds black hole and rotates quite fast so there are at least two additional sources for the redshift but how significant is their contribution
13282 ive recently come across this statement that massless particles arise from sod symetry and massive particles from sod would have guessed that it would be the exact opposite way but that doesnt seem so could someone point me in the right direction what exactly should be reading to understand this as im mathematician who has only recently been trying my way through string theory ive been wondering why is this is there some intuitiv way of thinking about this this was only briefly mentioned in the st book by becker becker schwarz
13289 motivation for asking question am planning to take the gre subject test for physics question can somebody please tell me what are the most important equations should definitely know and understand completely going into this test and for entering first year grad school for physics schodinger equation dp dt maxwell equations what else follow up question what are some miscellaneous equations that are also important to know
13354 regular dice are made such that opposite sides of the die add to the number of sides for example sided die has and opposite of each other adding to for certain types of games life counter die are used in these sides are numbered sequentially so that is next to which is next to which is next to and so on you can see picture here http www coolstuffinc com main supplies phpfpid acc qwsd20spindownlifecounterbluewhite now the question generally speaking will these two kinds of die yield equal probabilities assuming that both dice are well balanced particularly will the probability of getting certain number be the same will the probability of getting number above threshold be the same rolling or more

13388 conceivably it expands with the speed of light do not know but curious if there is an answer at what velocity does our universe expand
13400 what waveform does the light coming off different types of artificial light sources have and of course what are the underlying physical reason for them was inspired to ask this question because of several things have been hearing lately firstly there was recent ted talk about how led bulbs can be used to transmit data researchers have been working on the problem for little while now and theyve made fairly impressive product but it was only recently made possible by the led technology which has such fast response that it can easily compare to the transfer rates of electric information condiuits that we normally use my understanding is that incandescent bulbs flicker because they have hz ac power being pulsed through them in fact think hz was chosen in the first place because it was threshold that was unnoticeable to humans looking at high speed youtube video of such bulb demonstrates that it has very significant lag time responding to both the normal electrical phasor and being turned off in other words it flickers but it doesnt go dark at any point in the ac waveform looking for more information however was little disappointed since nothing seemed to give graph of lumens emitted over time for all different kinds of bulbs of course there isnt just one relevant time scale light could flicker with hz and also flicker with hz just made that up im interested in the complete picture of what lights exhibit what patterns
13426 believe that no real objects are actually exactly meter long since for something to be meters long we would have to have the ability to measure with infinite precision obviously this can be extended to any units of measurement am wrong
13451 in special relativity the spacetime interval between two events is delta delta delta delta giving the minkowski metric eta mu nu text diag what is the justification for making time have negative coefficient and how closely is that related to the 2nd law of thermodynamics sure by letting eta text diag we get pretty boring spacetime and the boosts in the poincar group become trig instead of hyperbolic functions but whats the physical reasoning behind this
13474 im talking about weighing balance shown in the figure press hold on onside of the horizontal beam and then release it it makes some oscillations and comes back to equilibrium like shown in the figure both the pans are of equal equal masses when the horizontal beam is tilted by an angle using external force the torque due to these pan weights are equal in magnitude opposite in direction then why does it come back to it position whats making it to come back
13480 typical problem in quantum mechanics is to calculate the spectrum that corresponds to given potential is there one to one correspondence between the potential and its spectrum if the answer to the previous question is yes then given the spectrum is there systematic way to calculate the corresponding potential
13571 is it possible to determine to an approximate degree the revolutions per minute of fan for example pedesal fan pictured below without using some electronic mechanical measuring device one thing that comes to mind is the markings on old record players turntable can that concept somehow be used to make marks on fan blade to determine its rpm or can something called strobe tuner help can maybe make markings on fan with marker and figure out the rpm using nothing else but stopwatch or maybe some other diy technique that does not require the purchase of any measuring device ps im not entirely sure if this is physics or engineering question so please feel free to move it to the appropriate site checked all stackexchange sites and only the physics site seemed to fit the question
13579 my local car parts dealer presented me his inventory of car batteries one 12v battery had cold crank amperage of 600amps the other 12v battery had cold crank amperage of 585amps questions if the resistance my truck is constant for both batteries how can the amperage ratings differ what is does batterys cold crank amperage really mean
13581 the standard picture of the nucleus of atom is that is several distinct nucleons which themselves are composed of quarks however it seems to me like much simpler picture is that the nucleus is directly made out of quarks without having nucleons as substructures that is that the nucleus is the ground state of quark gluon plasma cant find any evidence that this is false for instance if the distances between the nucleons was significantly larger than the size of the nucleons there would be difference in size between hydrogen and other atoms which cant be explained by this new framework but according to wikipedia the diameter of all of the nuclei is the same order of magnitude what is the evidence that large nuclei have nucleons as substructures
13624 and in what sense are they non local
13654 know what anti matter is and how when it collides with matter both are annihilated however what about anti photons are there such things as anti photons initially thought the idea preposterous however am curious because if anti photons dont exist then anti matter could theoretically transfer its energy to normal matter through the mechanism of light is it right
13714 does anyone have any suggestions as to what is good topic for short talk on theoretical physics to bunch of math and physics undergrads that might make them embrace theoretical physics thanks brain storm string theory quantum tunneling etc also it would be great if someone could suggest some resources
13757 read on wikipedia how the numerical value of avogadros number can be found by doing an experiment provided you have the numerical value of faradays constant but it seems to me that faradays constant could not be known before avogadros number was as its the electric charge per mole how could we know the charge of single electron just by knowing the charge of mole of electrons without knowing the ratio of the number of particles in both just want to know the method physically used and the reasoning and calculations done by the first person who found the number times10 or however accurate it was first discovered to be note see on the wikipedia page for avogadro constant that the numerical value was first obtained by johann josef loschmidt who in estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in given volume of gas but cant access any of the original sources that are cited can somebody explain it to me or else give an accessible link so can read about what exactly loschmidt did

14028 often hear people say that so and so some famous physicist can see the solution without calculation what exactly does this mean is it an intuition but how does one have intuition when it comes to say qm how might one develop such an intuition
14070 friend of mine was telling me about building cloud chamber while he was in graduate school as understand it this allows you to see interactions caused by high energy particles going through the cloud chamber this has fascinated me and would like to build one with my daughter but want to make sure am able to explain it to her when the eventual questions come can someone help me out please how would explain cloud chamber to someone who is freshman in high school
14072 have quite often heard and even used the idea that quantum fluctuations are way to explain the whole something from nothing intuitive leap am about to give talk at local school on cosmology and just want to make sure that dont misstate anything as layperson type of explanation would this pass the close enough to what theory actually states test
14074 this question recently appeared on slashdot slashdot posts fair number of physics stories many of us myself included dont have the background to understand them so id like to ask the slashdot math physics community to construct curriculum that gets me an average college grad with two semesters of chemistry one of calculus and maybe applied statistics courses all the way to understanding the mathematics of general relativity what would need to learn in what order and what texts should use before get killed here know this isnt weekend project but it seems like it could be fun to do in my spare time for the next decade it seems like something that would be good addition to this site think its specific enough to be answerable but still generally useful the textbook aspect is covered pretty well by book recommendations but beyond that what college level subjects in physics and math are prerequisites to studying general relativity in mathematical detail
14082 get the physical significance of vector addition subtraction but dont understand what do dot cross products mean more specifically why is it that dot product of vectors vec and vec is defined as ab cos theta why is it that cross product of vectors vec and vec is defined as ab sin theta times unit vector determined from the right hand rule to me both these formulae seem to be arbitrarily defined although know that it definitely wouldnt be the case if the cross product could be defined arbitrarily why cant we define division of vectors whats wrong with that why cant vectors be divided

14165 my professor told me recently that area is vector google search gave me the following definition for vector noun quantity having direction as well as magnitude esp as determining the position of one point in space relative to another my question is what is the direction of area can relate to the fact that velocity is vector the velocity of moving motorbike for example has definite direction as well as definite magnitude assuming that the bike is moving in straight line not accelerating my friend gave me this explanation for the direction of area vector consider rectangular plane in space he argued that the orientation of the plane in space can only be described by considering area as vector not scalar still wasnt convinced suppose the plane was placed such that its faces were perpendicular to the directions north south for example now the orientation of the plane is the same irrespective whether the so called vector points to north or to the south further what is the direction of spheres area does considering area as vector have any real significance please explain thanks in advance
14175 this is question directly from homework sheet however cant find any decent answers online so hopefully someone can help in single slit diffraction why is the central maximum double the width of the other bands and the brightest understand vaguely that it is something to do with fresnel zones but im quite confused instead of making another question think this question also fits in with the above why does the intensity of light bands decrease away from the central maximum in single slit diffraction thanks
14182 there are lot of articles being posted in the wake of cern announcement that they have not observed the higgs boson in the range of energies so far searched between and billion ev this scientific american blog post how can this be wasnt the existence of the higgs an almost foregone conclusion can someone who looked at the details at cern explain if they are hoping to run the lhc for more time to find it or is the search becoming hopeless or perhaps its energy was estimated wrong

14377 have good undergrad knowledge of quantum mechanics and im interesting in reading up more about interpretation and in particular things related to how qm emerges algebraically from some reasonable real world assumptions however want to avoid the meticulous maths style and rather read something more meant for physicists where rigorous proofs arent needed and things are well behaved id prefer more intuitive resources as opposed to the rigorous texts can you recommend some reading to get started
14436 how does one prove the formula for entropy sum ln obviously systems on the microscopic level are fully determined by the microscopic equations of motion so if you want to introduce law on top of that you have to prove consistency entropy cannot be postulate can imagine that it is derived from probability theory for general system do you know such line once you have such reasoning what are the assumptions to it can these assumptions be invalid for special systems would these system not obey thermodynamics statistical mechanics and not have any sort of temperature no matter how general if thermodynamics stat mech are completely general how would you apply them the system where one point particle orbits another
14481 consider the real scalar field phixt on dimensional space time with some action for instance phi frac pi nu int dx dt partial phi partial phi partial phi where is some constant and nu in mathbb this example describes massless edge excitations in the fractional quantum hall effect to obtain the quantum mechanics of this field there are two possibilities perform canonical quantization promote the field phi to an operator and set phi pi hbar where pi is the canonically conjugate momentum from the lagrangian use the feynman path integral to calculate all expectation values of interest like langle phixt phi00 rangle and forget about operators altogether my question is are the approaches and always equivalent it appears to me that the feynman path integral is sure way to formulate quantum field theory from an action while canonical quantization can sometimes fail for instance the commutation relations for the field phi in the example above look really weird it is conjugate to its own derivative pixt frac pi nu partial phixt the prefactor is already little off for this to make sense we have to switch to fourier transformation and regard the negative field modes as conjugate momenta pi frac pi nu ik phi more serious example it seems to me that the feynman integral easily provides quantum theory of the electromagnetic gauge field mu whereas in canonical quantization we must first choose an appropriate gauge and hope that the quantization does not depend on our choice could you give short argument why gives the right quantum theory of the electromagnetic field standard action frac1 pi mu nu mu nu

14571 working on homework problem which asks for the dominant contribution em strong or weak to the process overline rightarrow lambda overline lambda know that the em interaction cannot change flavor but not sure how this rule applies to the overline rightarrow overline annihilation indicated in this diagram is it valid to say that since there is no net flavor on either side the photon could be the boson involved this almost doesn matter for my purposes since the process can be strong think that ll be my answer to the question anyway was still curious about whether this could be an em process though

14622 we sometimes play game in my family whereby we trace the energy for device back to its source the xbox got power from the wall the wall got power from the local transformer the transformer got power from the coal plant via the power lines the coal plant got power from the turbines etc on and on until weve reached the core of the sun in dinosaur times but my son stumped me the other day what it is it in particular about petroleum and gasoline that makes it so high in energy density secondarily presume that gasoline has other qualities that make it good fuel not exploding spontaneously without significant energy what are these other qualities finally if energy input were not an economic consideration and we only cared about energy density and the other goldilocks factors is there better fuel or is gasoline not only the best actual fuel but the best theoretical fuel
14639 am trying to understand the saddle point approximation and apply it to problem have but the treatments have seen online are all very mathematical and are not giving me good qualitative description of the method and why its used and for what its used so my question is how is the saddle point approximation used in physics what is it approximating when can it be used
14700 my friend and have been wracking our heads with this one for the past hours we have point masses and in perfect world separated by radius starting from rest they both begin to accelerate towards each other so we have the gravitational force between them as frac mm how do we find out at what time they will collide what were having trouble with is this function being function of but have suspected it as actually function of due to the units of being nm kg ive tried taking number of integrals which havent really yielded anything useful any guidance no this is not an actual homework problem were just math physics computer people who are very bored at work

14906 want to check my understanding of the wigner transform and try to understand why and how exactly the probabilistic interpretation drops down as the function goes to zero and then to negative values so suppose we have free quantum oscillator with integer eigenvalues of energy and boson occupation questions is it possible to start the system in state that will have well defined wigner phase space probability density with an analog interpretation as liouville phase space density and it will freely evolve into state for which the wigner density becomes negative valued in other words is the positive definite property of wigner density invariant under free evolution is there simple system hopefully simple harmonic oscillator based state for which the wigner density transitions from being positive definite to being negative at certain regions what happens with the probability interpretation in the boundary of the transition between positive definite and negative at certain regions in general
14939 dels incompleteness theorem prevents universal axiomatic system for math is there any reason to believe that it also prevents theory of everything for physics edit havent before seen formulation of del that included time the formulation ive seen is that any axiomatic systems capable of doing arithmetic can express statements that will be either impossible to prove true or false or possible to prove both true and false this leads to the question are theories of nearly everything axiomatic systems capable of doing arithmetic given they are able to describe digital computer think its safe to say they are if so it follows that such theory will be able to describe something that the theory will be either unable to analyse or will result in an ambiguous result might this be what forces things like the heisenberg uncertainty principle
14968 was quite surprised to read this all over the news today elusive nearly massive subatomic particles called neutrinos appear to travel just faster than light team of physicists in europe reports if so the observation would wreck einsteins theory of special relativity which demands that nothing can travel faster than light source apparently cern gran sasso team measured faster than light speed for neutrinos is this even remotely possible if so would it be real violation of lorentz invariance or an almost but not quite effect the paper is on arxiv webcast is was planned here news conference video here
14973 earlier today saw this link on facebook about neutrinos going faster than the speed of light and of course re posted since then couple of my friends have gotten into discussion about what this means mostly about time travel but dont really know what this really implies this made me wonder what are the biggest and most immediate implications of this potential discovery related superluminal neutrinos
14993 have question that came up in discussion with friends if throw ball straight up in an enclosed train car moving with constant velocity believe the basic physics books say it will land in the same spot but will it really think can say that the answer is not in the real world trivially train car is never enclosed fresh air is being allowed into the carriage or the passengers would all die thus theres currents of air that would affect the ball agreed if we remove the passengers and have trusty robot who does not need oxygen throw the ball up in carriage that really is completely air tight im still not sure it will land in the same spot would imagine that there must still be air circulation the train had to start from stop its true the floor and the roof will drag the air right at the boundary along with it but just as an open convertible car does not drag all the air in the world with it assume that the air in the middle of the car will not be dragged along at the same speed the air in the middle will remain stationary with respect to earth and pile up at the back of the car then it will be forced along further imagine that this pile of air will try to redistribute itself uniformally wont all this set up currents will the air come to be completely still in the reference frame of the car im guessing the answer is yet how long would this take bonus question believe if im sitting in convertible car and throw ball straight up it will land back in my hand as long as dont throw it too far up at some point ill throw it to high and will lose the ball out the back of the car whats the relevant equation covering this in car travelling at miles per hour in still air put another way im trying to get feel for how extensive the boundary layer of air around the car is and how it dissipates with distance
15002 can someone suggest textbook that treats general relativity from rigorous mathematical perspective ideally such book would prove all theorems used use modern mathematical notation as opposed to physics notation especially with respect to linear algebra and differential geometry have examples that illustrate both computational and theoretical aspects have range of exercises with varying degrees of difficulty with answers an ideal text would read lot more like math book than physics book and would demand few prerequisites in physics bottom line is that would like book that provides an axiomatic development of general relativity clearly and with mathematical precision works out the details of the theory addendum did not intend to start war over notation as said in one of the comments below think indicial notation together with the summation convention is very useful the coordinate free approach has its uses as well and see no reason why the two cant peacefully coexist what meant by mathematics notation vs physics notation is the following consider as an example one of the leading texts on smooth manifolds john lees introduction to smooth manifolds am very accustomed to this notation and it very similar to the notation used by tus introduction to manifolds for instance and other popular texts on differential geometry on the other hand take frankels geometry of physics now this is nice book but it is very difficult for me to follow it because lack of proofs and 2the notation does not agree with other math texts that im accustomed to of course there are commonalities but enough is different that find it really annoying to try to translate between the two addendum for the benefit of future readers in addition to suggestions below have found another text that also closely aligns with the criteria stated above it is spacetime foundations of general relativity and differential geometry by marcus kriele the author begins by discussing affine geometry analysis on manifolds multilinear algebra and other underpinnings and leads into general relativity at roughly the midpoint of the text the notation is also fairly consistent with the books on differential geometry mentioned above
15055 ive been wondering what causes the normal force to exist in class the teacher never actually explains it he just says it has to be there because something has to counter gravity while understand this is true it never explains why whenever ask anyone else they always respond in similar way saying it has to be there because the object is not accelerating and this has become very frustrating so what is the cause of the normal force from my reasoning it has to be one of the four fundamental forces gravity electromagnetism the weak force or the strong force it would seam to me that electromagnetism would make to most sense electrons in the outer shells of atoms repelling each other however just as thought this had to be right read thing online about certain fundamental particles repelling each other when their wave functions overlap havent studied quantum mechanics yet so im not really sure what to make of that if anyone could shed some light on this for me it would be much appreciated
15083 in the movie melancholia planet also called melancholia enters the solar system and hits the earth want to leave aside the also unreasonable aspect that planet hides behind the sun and is undetected until its few weeks from earth want to focus on the final stages in the movie the planet passes close to the earth starts receding doubles back and hits the earth all in few days my question is that physically possible guess not but was never good at orbital mechanics assume the givens are as in the movie one of the main characters finds on the internet path for the planet that seems to what it eventually does mass of the planet is four times that of the earth
15088 are there any other facilities that would be capable of independantly verifying the opera result in other words completely different source detector for nu mu beams alternatively there might be another source that could send beam to the same detector at gran sasso with different baseline looking to verify the value of frac with different value of delta
15098 im learning about angular velocity momentum etc and how all the equations are parallel to linear equations such as velocity or momentum however im having trouble comparing angular acceleration to linear acceleration looking at each equation they are not as similar as some of the other equations are anglular acceleration velocity squared radius linear acceleration force mass would think angular acceleration would take torque into consideration how is vsquared similar in relation to force and how is radiuss relation to vsquared match the relationship between mass and force suppose the root of this misunderstanding is how im thinking of angular acceleration which is only an vector representing an axiss direction and having magnitude equal to the number of radians rotated per second also am confused on what exactly tangential velocity represents and how its used is it vector whose magnitude is equal to the number of radians any point on polygon should rotate what is the explanation
15102 not sure if this is the right place to post but how is it possible to have laws of theory theory is not able to be law since its just an explanation that can always be disproven so how is there law of theory
15135 basically cant stop wondering why light the photon is so special compared to all the other particles known and unknown to modern day physics could it be that there exists an upper limit on speed that is instead property of another entity particle wave other than the photon question obviously inspired by the recent very slightly possible superluminal neutrino findings
15206 as per in the title if it turns out that neutrinos do travel faster than the speed of light how will the success of special relativity be explained my apologies if this has been asked before ive just browsed through few questions and couldnt find one that matches although it was slightly touched on in one answer
15231 am reading document and in answer to the question state newton second law of motion the candidate answers that the force acting on an object equals the rate of change of momentum of the object while this is not complete answer the examiner picks on on word equal and says that it is proportional instead now understand that frac dp dt where both and are vectors what is proportional about it checked my good old ohanian 2nd edition and it says explicitly the rate of change of momentum equals force in section the momentum of particle what is this examiner talking about
15249 assume want to learn math and physics enough to reach level where understand maxwells equations the terms and reasoning in the equations why they work what would have to learn in order to have the tools need to make sense out of it im kindof looking for road map which can use to get started and know what to focus on the fields are pretty big so some pruning would be very helpful if possible
15366 if you compress large mass on the order of star or the earth into very small space you get black hole even for very large masses it is possible in principle for it to occupy very small size like that of golf ball started to think how would matter react around this golf ball sized earth if let go of coffee mug next to it it would go tumbling down toward the golf ball isnt that exactly how magnets work with paperclips for example magnets are cool because they seem to defy the laws of gravity on scale that we can casually see clearly the force carrier particles that produce electromagnetic attraction are stronger than gravity on this scale or are at least on par gravity plays some role in the paperclips path but so does electromagnetism my question is why do we try to consider gravity as anything different than magnetism perhaps great mass equates to positively or negatively charged object pull so much matter in close and somewhere youve crossed the line between what we call electromagnetic force and gravity force they are one in the same no
15385 the usual story ive heard describing the difference between hz note played by flute and trumpet is that the overtones are different that is if you play note at hz there will also be fourier components at hz hz etc the difference in the relative amplitudes of those higher harmonics constitutes the difference between instruments however if you mess around with fourier applet like this one the first from google search think youll quickly become convinced that you cant make sound like trumpet flute or pretty much anything other than an electronic box with it whats the essential difference between the idealized sound source and the real sound source
15516 this is very basic question on optics how are we able to view an object kept in room with bulb from what understand light rays from bulb will hit the object and some colour will be absorbed and rest will be thrown off but how does the thrown off light reach eyes thought light ray will reflect with same angle back as the angle between incident ray and normal then how is it guaranteed that reflected ray will reach eyes
15517 what would happen if we have black hole and we start shooting at it single electron at time and go on doing it forever would the electrons start to bounce off eventually
15587 have background in calculus but dont really know anything about physics forgive me if this is really basic question the equation for distance of an accelerating object with constant acceleration is ut frac at which can also be expressed frac mathrm mathrm frac mathrm mathrm frac where xt is the position of the object at time thats fine for canonball or something like that but what about car accelerating from to cruising speed the acceleration is obviously not constant but what about the change in acceleration is it constant suspect not and then what about the change in the change of acceleration etc etc in other words how does one know how many additional terms to add in the series frac mathrm mathrm frac mathrm mathrm frac frac mathrm mathrm frac frac mathrm mathrm frac cdot etc cdot

15640 im tutoring senior high school students so far ive explained them the concepts of atomic structure bohrs model quantum mechanical model very clearly now the next topic to be taught is semiconductors myself am not conviced with the concept of electron holes if there is no electron then there is no electron how can it be hole we define hole when there is some thing every where except at place but inside an atom how can we define hole kindly explain it with the help of bohrs model what was the need of introducing such abstract concept in semi conductors
15642 im guessing that this would be someone in rocket or something when they hit their top speed at what fraction of are they traveling
15666 what is the current consensus on max tegmarks mathematical universe hypothesis muh which claims every concievable mathematical structure exists including infinite different universes etc realize its more metaphysics than physics and that it is not falsifiable yet lot of people seem to be taking liking to it so is it something that is plausible ive yet to hear any very good objections to it other than its crazy but are there any real technical problems with it
15738 was surprised to read that we dont know how to analyze turbulent fluids on page of the feynman lectures on physics volume one feynman writes finally there is physical problem that is common to many fields that is very old and that has not been solved nobody in physics has really been able to analyze it mathematically satisfactorily in spite of its importance to the sister sciences it is the analysis of circulating or turbulent fluids if we watch the evolution of star there comes point where we can deduce that it is going to start convection and thereafter we can no longer deduce what should happen few million years later the star explodes but we cannot figure out the reason we cannot analyze the weather we do not know the patterns of motions that there should be inside the earth which cause earthquakes the simplest form on the problem is to take pipe that is very long and push water through it at high speed we ask to push given amount of water through that pipe how much pressure is needed no one can analyze it from first principles and the properties of water if the water flows very slowly or if we use thick goo like honey then we can do it nicely you will find that in your textbook what we really cannot do is deal with actual wet water running through pipe that is the central problem which we ought to solve some day and we have not im no physicist but imagine hes saying that we have differential equations describing turbulent fluids but no one has ever been able to explicitly solve them or sufficiently determine their properties however feynmans words were written over years ago now has there been any progress in analyzing turbulent fluids since then
15742 im asked to show that frac hat hat lambda frac hat lambda hat hat frac hat lambda with lambda continuous parameter should use the definition frac hat lambda lim epsilon to frac hat lambda epsilon hat lambda epsilon applied to hat hat like frac hat hat lambda lim epsilon to frac hat lambda epsilon hat lambda epsilon hat lambda hat lambda epsilon and do some algebra to get the rhs of the first equation or im missing something another interesting derivative to pay attention to is frac lambda exp hat lambda
15762 was watching an outtake of prof brian cox talking to tv producer about gravity waves their discussion got bit side tracked because the non scientist didnt seem to understand what wave would look like and also because there seemed to be some difficulties with the phrase moving through with prof cox saying that wave doesnt move through space time and then saying the ripples do im now not sure what moves when speaker plays sound the air vibrates but does ripple outward so what is wave obviously im really after much simplified probably broken metaphor that allows me to visualise what wave is understand that it will have flaws forgot to include the youtube link so here it is http www youtube com watchv 6ej8r9rhfw8
15791 looking at the radius and mass of stars on wikipedia see that the sun is the densest of all often many times denser than other stars is that because only non dense starts are easily seen from distance are there any stars of comparable luminosity to the sun that can be seen with the naked eye and do they have similar density as the sun if needed can copy paste the mass and radius of other stars here for reference
15809 this is something that have wondered for long time how come when walk around why do not see random black spots where light has collided destructively and bright spots where it has collided constructively
15841 just finished watching this interesting video http youtu be s9dqjryk0ym it does very quick explanation of how pink light doesnt exist and that the concept of pink is our brains attempt at filling in gap in the spectrum my question is how does our brain perceive this gap what frequency is this pink color if it truly doesnt exist is it frequency greater than violet or is it greater than red sorry if this question seems trivial
15855 just saw this demonstration by someone from tel aviv university lab what they achieved there is mind blowing myself own levitron that uses the hall effect to levitate magnet the problem with that is the magnet must always be flat facing the hall effect base any unbalance will wreck the levitation but in the case of the video you can see that he isnt constrained by such things the disk can levitate and stay still at whatever angle and orientation instead of being levitated the disk is simply being held still how does this happen he referred to this as quantum trapping but ive little idea about what that is also what material is the base in these demos is the circular track in the demonstration magnetic assume this is so is there any conceivable way for this technology to make objects levitate on any surface
15858 in seminar heard that the unitary aspect of representations was important physically because in quantum mechanics unitarity is closely tied to the conservation of probability could someone explain why this is so after bit of thought one vague connection can think of is that matrix generated by hermitian matrix ih where is hermitian is bound to be unitary as hermitian matrices correspond to observables this must have some signficiance though as said still have the faintest idea
15960 could ship equipped with alcubierre drive theoretically escape from black hole also could it reach parts of the universe that are receding faster than the speed of light from us
15963 could the opera result be interpreted as some kind of hint to discrete spacetime that is only seen for high enough energy neutrinos think ive read some time ago something like this in popular article where among other things tests of quantum gravity theories that assume discrete spacetime are explained looking around in blogs and other places in the web notice that this is disussed seldom or not at all
15981 ive read many times including here on this very site that the commonly known explanation of flight is wrong and that airplanes can fly because the shape of their wings deflects air down this makes sense but as far as can tell it doesnt explain upside down flight or symmetric wings the images ive seen show an inclined wing which forces the air to go downwards but how can planes fly upside down then
16018 quite few of the questions given on this site mention photon in vacuum having rest frame such as it having zero mass in its rest frame find this contradictory since photons must travel at the speed of light in all frames according to special relativity does photon in vacuum have rest frame
16048 so atoms are formed from protons and neutrons which are formed from quarks but where do these quarks come from what makes them
16091 in quantum mechanics particles are described by wave functions which describe probability amplitudes in quantum field theory particles are described by excitations of quantum fields what is the analog of the quantum mechanical wave function is it spectrum of field configurations in analogy with qm wave functions spectrum of particle observables where each field configuration can be associated with probability amplitude or is the field just essentially superposition of infinitely many wave functions for each point along the field as if you quantized continuous mattress of infinitesimal coupled particles

16225 probability of interaction between two particles tends to wane with increasing energy technically the cross section of most interactions falls off with increasing velocity sigmav propto frac this raises fun question since interaction probability diminishes with increasing relative velocity if you impart enough energy to particle might it just mostly pass through solid matter might solid matter pass through solid matter with some radiation damage of course the above relation of course is lacking great deal we are really interested in the mean path length as well as the linear rate of energy deposition lets consider the problem in the context of two chunks of solid matter moving at each other really fast like space jousting we have several requirements for survivable experiment average path length for any given nucleus electron from spaceship moving through spaceship must be much greater than spaceship bs length the energy deposition as result of the passing must be small enough such that they dont explode like nuclear bomb right after passing the question also becomes highly relativistic and want to hear commentary from people who have knowledge of interactions in high energy accelerators lets say youre on the star trek enterprise and the captain proposes an alternative to navigating the densely packed matter in the approaching galaxy by increasing speed to just under the speed of light and not worrying about obstacles because youll pass through them what arguments would you use to convince him this might not be the best idea edit this video seems to make the claim that super high energy protons may pass through the entire earth do the answers here contradict the claim http www youtube com watchv atbvpxqifts
16231 common statement in any quantum field theory text is that only compact groups have finite dimensional representations and that the lorentz group is not compact since it is parameterised by leq fair enough but u1 is parametrised by leq theta pi so why is u1 compact should they be described as closed instead or am getting lost
16386 have tough problem am not sure how to solve for this question we are confined to plane consider gravitational field that is proportional to frac instead of frac and consider its potential which is then proportional to frac suppose that put identical point masses in this plane all at different locations and let uxy be the potential function what can we say about the critical points of uxy specifically can we show that the number of critical points is always leq remark by critical point mean the usual definition in vector calculus that is place where both partial derivatives are zero
16390 say im flying from sydney to los angeles s2la back to sydney la2s during s2la travelling with the rotation of the earth would the flight time be longer than la2s on account of los angeles turning moving away from our position or in the opposite direction would the flight to sydney be faster since the earth turns underneath us and moves sydney closer please ignore jet stream effects and all other variables this is control case in an ideal environment by dramatically suppose mean delay of hour or more
16474 want to know if there is any anti gravity material am thinking of making flying vehicles which are made up of anti gravity material so that they will not experience any gravity on them and can easily take off and be more fuel efficient is there any such thing or any workaround
16561 tap faucet when turn tap on full and then put my thumb over the spout covering say of it then the water spurts out if turn it on to say then the water dribbles out whats the essential difference between the way that my thumb covers most of the hole and the way the tap valve opens that makes the water come out at different pressure in either case

16711 saw this video of the double slit experiment by dr quantum on youtube later in the video he says the behavior of the electrons changes to produce double bars effect as if it knows that it is being watched or observed what does that mean how is that even possible an atom knows if it is being watched seriously probably likely are the chances that didnt understand the video
16814 could someone experienced in the field tell me what the minimal math knowledge one must obtain in order to grasp the introductory quantum mechanics book course do have math knowledge but must say currently kind of poor one did basic introductory course in calculus linear algebra and probability theory perhaps you could suggest some books have to go through before can start with qm
16850 im not sure what to make of the direction of vector with components is it an undefined vector
17076 ive always been taught that the spring constant is constant that is for given spring will always be the same regardless of what you do to the spring my friends physics professor gave practice problem in which spring of length was cut into four parts of length he claimed that the spring constant in each of the new springs cut from the old spring text new was therefore equal to text orig is this true every person ive asked seems to think that this is false and that will be the same even if you cut the spring into parts is there good explanation of whether will be the same after cutting the spring or not it seems like if its an inherent property of the spring it shouldnt change so if it does why
17087 im not new to qft yet there are some matters which are quite puzzling to me often come across the statement that real particles the ones we actually measure in experiments not virtual ones are slightly off shell what does this actually mean to my knowledge something being off shell means that it violates the relativistic energy momentum relation but how can this be possible for particles we actually consider to be physical please fill me in on the mathematical experimental backing for such statement to any degree of detail necessary
17109 recently came to know about the conventional current vs electron flow issue doing some search found that the reason for this is that benjamin franklin made mistake when naming positive and negative charges there is even this little comic about that http xkcd com my question is how can naming convention be wrong perhaps dont understand what is the actual mistake here dont know but dont see how naming convention could be wrong or right there is no right and wrong about that it couldve been any other name like charge and charge ill appreciate anyone can help me understand what is wrong in all this

17259 possible duplicate is it possible for information to be transmitted faster than light consider the following thought experiment you have long perfectly rigid beam for the sake of simplicity suppose it is one light second long which is placed on fulcrum in the middle so it is like an extremely long see saw there are two participants on either side of the beam suppose participant flips coin and based on the flip chooses to place either light or heavy boulder on his end of the beam participant one light second away sits down on his end of the beam what happens to participant for the first second of his sit if participant randomly decided to place light boulder on his end then participant would lower the beam with his weight conversely if theres heavy boulder on the other end hell stay up in the air either way he will know in that first second what the outcome of participant as coin flip was and therefore gain one bit of information faster than the speed of light this is of course patently impossible my guess as you can probably tell from the title of the question is that this entire hypothetical situation cannot happen because there is not really such thing as perfectly rigid body the reason that one end of lever moves at all in relation to the other is because the electromagnetic forces between the atoms in the beam push each other up but what does this look like for absurd lengths like one light second does the upward motion travel like wave through the beam does the speed of this wave depend on the material the magnitude of the forces involved or something else entirely is there name for it and what if anything does participant feel in that first second and what would the beam look like to an external observer who can see the whole beam at once cant intuitively visualize any of this at all standard disclaimer only know high school level physics if that helps when aiming answers

17551 am wondering whether the five units of the natural unit system really is dictated by nature or invented to satisfy the limited mind of man is the number of linearly independent units property of the nature or can we use any number we like if it truly is property of nature what is the number five can we prove that there not is more in the answers please do not consider cgs units as extensions really is needed to cover all phenomenon or atomic units where units only disappear out of convenience or si units where the mole for substance amount is just as crazy as say some invented unit to measure amount of money length time mass electric charge and temperature or and other linearly independent units spanning the same space
17587 most gps receivers and smart phones contain an electronic compass which understand is generally hall effect magnetometer these devices generally require calibration which involves waving the device in an shaped figure during the motion the forward axis is tilted about degrees in each direction and the sideways axis inverted there and back initial direction does not matter the device does not to be put in any special mode for the calibration this calibration is needed each time the device is turned on why is it needed the hall effect sensor should measure magnitude of the magnetic field in given direction so id expect pair of sensors to be able to measure direction and magnitude of magnetic field in horizontal plane consistently each time and needle compass isnt doing anything more can understand the other kind of calibration turning the compass around twice slowly as needed to compensate for magnetic bias generated by the device itself but thats only needed once as expected the device generates same bias each time so what is this every time calibration compensating for
17592 is there an easy way to look at partial different equation and get sense of what kind of phenomena it is physically describing have an equation that looks like this partial ta partial xx partial leftva right 1a from inspecting it and doing some searching it seemed like it might be trying to describe phenomena that had advection and diffusion occurring at the same time is this correct interpretation note that and vxt is velocity im not sure but it seems reasonable to assume velocity can be either negative or positive also axt should be positive note that im not looking for solution to the equation just the physical interpretation of what kind of physics would be involved
17628 am currently high school student researching quantum computing was referred to this site by google and friend currently am researching the qubit part of quantum computing my question is exactly how are qubits created in the lab and how are they entangled dont expect the answers to be incredibly specific but general overview would be of great deal of help

17728 in quantum field theory when dealing with divergent integrals particularly in calculating corrections to scattering amplitudes what is often done to render the integrals convergent is to add regulator which is some parameter lambda which becomes the upper limit of the integrals instead of infty the physical explanation of this is that the quantum field theory is just an approximation of the true theory if one exists and it is only valid at low energies we are ignorant of the processes that occur at high energies and so it makes no sense to extend the theory to that regime so we cut off the integral to include the low energy processes we are familiar with only my problem with this explanation is even if we dont know what happens at high energies is it okay to just leave those phenomena out of our calculations in effect we are rewriting our integral as int infty infty int infty lambda int lambda infty and then ignoring the second term is this really okay and even if we were able to ascertain the true theory and calculated the contribution to the correction from high energy processes feel like it would come out to be large since looking at it from our effective field theory viewpoint it already appears to be infinity do we have any right to say it is negligible
17741 on systems level understand that as electrons are pushed into wire there is net field and net electron velocity and ive read that the net electron drift is slow but electricity travels through the wire essentially at and want to understand that mechanism my apologies if my question is poorly stated know bare bones undergraduate quantum theory circa 1990s but it doesnt explain the motion of electricity in detail heres my conception im hoping someone will fill in the holes ha ha an electron moves into the wire its got kinetic energy after travelling short distance it spontaneously emits photon which hits another electron in valence shell that electron then presumably does the same if this conception is simply wrong please enlighten me the questions that arise presumably at this level electrons are acting more like waves and less like particles but is there any classical component in the picture ie are electrons coming in imparting other electrons with kinetic energy through repulsion or does it not work that way if electrons momentarily have energy then pass it on by photon what determines when that photon is emitted and what frequency it will be assume that electrons in this cloud are not limited by any kind of exclusion principal and that any frequencies are possible why should photon emitted by an electron be in the direction of travel conservation of momentum tells me that if an electron is moving the photon should be emitted in that direction slowing the electron but could an electron emit photon in the opposite direction if it did assume it would somehow have had to absorb energy from elsewhere that sounds possible by analogy with quantum tunneling what is the mechanism by which electrons propagating increase the temperature of the material are they transmitting energy to the electrons in the valence shell which tug at the nucleus do some photons hit the nuclei directly or is there some other way presumably electricity travels slower than light because there is some time in each exchange and some time when electrons are moving at sublight speeds before emitting photon by how much is this slower than light and what is the speed of each interaction

17989 my workplace uses these things to generate one time passwords which only work within short time period have always been curious about how the clock synchronisation between the authentication server and the token might work im not sure whether there is any communication between the token and the outside world at all but would doubt it because they are small light and they must make these things to be as cheap as possible for lowest unit cost so maybe there isnt any synchronization at all but then wouldnt the clocks gradually drift apart especially if the battery was running down eventually resulting in bricked token

18174 so energy comes to earth from sun in the form of em waves some of it is reflected back but some of it remains on earth and is used by plants to create food and some is used in the atmosphere creating storms but how is this energy sent back to space if it is not sent back then does it mean that the total energy on earth as whole is continuously increasing

18280 why do quantum physical properties come in pairs governed by the uncertainty principle that is position and momentum why not in groups of three four etc
18405 suppose am going to the doctors and want to do either of the following make myself lighter on the scale make myself heavier on the scale for isnt it just relaxing and let your mass drop for how could do this should maybe exert force on table close by will that force from my hand transfer to the scale
18443 in the first lecture of mits classical mechanics prof lewin highlights the importance of uncertainties in measurements by quoting any measurements without the knowledge of uncertainty is meaningless he measures the length of student and an aluminium bar both in their vertical and horizontal positions respectively and notes their lengths in centimeters and calculates the difference between the two positions question is it so important to make such serious considerations while making measurements do professional physicists make such considerations when making real world measurements arent we well equipped to just ignore these uncertainties
18446 would the effect of gravity on me change if were to dig very deep hole and stand in it if so how would it change am more likely to be pulled downwards or pulled towards the edges of the hole if there would be no change why not
18519 am not entirely clear as to what were the bases for heisenbergs assumptions in his paper he claims that one cannot consider relations between quantities that are unobservable in principle like the position and period of revolution of an electron to quote some text these rules the abovementioned relations lack an evident physical foundation unless one still wants to retain the hope that the hitherto unobservable quantities may later come within the realm of experimental determination this hope might be justified if such rules were internally consistent and applicable to clearly defined range of quantum mechanical problems my first query is why does he claim the position and period of an electron to be unobservable in principle there was theoretically no reason at that time to doubt that these quantities could be measured though certainly they were indeterminate practically secondly just because theory dealing with those quantities is inconsistent or not general enough why does it imply that we cannot define or measure quantities that that theory deals with we may be able to measure some quantities perfectly but still formulate an incorrect theory around them finally is there any ad hoc basis to decide what these uncertain quantities are more specifically how could heisenberg pinpoint position of an electron as an uncertain parameter and not any other quantity like some electric field etc thanks in advance by the way im studying the original paper solely to look more closely at the motivation for assumptions underlying the theory
18527 according to brian cox in his night with the stars lecture the pauli exclusion principle means that no electron in the universe can have the same energy state as any other electron in the universe and that if he does something to change the energy state of one group of electrons rubbing diamond to heat it up in his demo then that must cause other electrons somewhere in the universe to change their energy states as the states of the electrons in the diamond change but when does this change occur surely if the electrons are separated by significant gap then the change cannot be instant because information can only travel at the speed of light wouldnt that mean that if you changed the energy state of one electron to be the same as another electron that was some distance away then surely the two electrons would be in the same state until the information that one other electron is in the same state reaches the other electron or can information be transferred instantly from one place to another if it can then doesnt that mean its not bound by the same laws as the rest of the universe the youtube link keeps breaking so here is search on youtube for brian cox night with the stars lecture
18539 let be the unitary evolution operator of quantum system be ut expith for then what is the meaning of the equation det bigli ute ite bigr where is real variable
18563 am currently trying to learn some basic quantum mechanics and am bit confused wikipedia defines photon as quantum of light which it further explains as some kind of wave packet what exactly is quantum of light more precisely is quantum of light meant to be just certain number of wavelengths of light something like quantum single period of sine wave perhaps or is the concept completely unrelated to wavelengths in other words how much is single quantum
18623 okay ive got little bit of laymans question here were doing bit of spring cleaning in our office and weve found cabinet with boxes upon boxes of stored wires so naturally this discussion arose picture normal bog standard wire with plastic outer coating now quite often when these wires are stored they will wrapped up and twisted to effectively make coil was just wondering what the effects of this type of storage would have what if you had 15m wire and only used the each end to cover about single meter leaving 14m still twisted and wrapped in the middle what the effect of the electrical current running through this have thanks for helping us settle mild dispute
18632 can anyone recommend good book on the history of quantum mechanics preferably one that is technical and not afraid to explain the maths did degree in physics many years ago and also that explains the developments using the technical language of the time rather than using treatments as we know understand them if it also explained the input from experiments that would be great too
18670 apologize if this seems like quack question but need some insights by those who know much more than me in physics anyway the gravitational force not really force is manifestation of the curvature of space time caused due to presence of mass suppose conjecture that any force electroweak strong is also manifestation of some property of space time effected by something as in mass in the case of gravity and different for different types of forces so is there any blatant fault with this line of thought im asking for blatant faults since its wild supposition anyway
18793 background was recently reading book on the planets to my son and noticed pattern in the distributions of the planets the planets distances roughly follow an exponential distribution below is plot of scaled log orbital distances tilde frac logd logd with the line an where corresponds to mercury and so on ceres is included pluto is excluded by linear regression for the statistically minded the data has pearsons correlation of note that this is well known phenomenon see pletser and references the code used to generate the plot may be provided on request question what is the mechanism that leads to this distribution aside is there good introductory text on solar system formation for the mathematically inclined update this is also known as titius bode law
18795 hydrogen nucleus consists of single proton hydrogen deuterium nucleus consists of proton and neutron tritium nucleus consists of proton and two neutrons this makes me wonder how an atomic nucleus made of proton and minus one neutron would look like and the closest thing to minus one neutron can imagine is an antineutron what happens if we combine proton and an antineutron are things like this even possible if such thing is an atomic nucleus can we add an electron and get an atom edit in the comments below also asked this more specific question suppose its useful to also mention it here in order not to create complete chaos if the proton and antineutron annihilate is it still possible that the thing they annihilate to remains somehow stable enough to behave like an atomic nucleus
18812 was recently looking at wurlitzer juke box and noticed something strange its decorated with liquid filled tubes gas bubbles are injected at the bottoms of the tubes and the bubbles naturally rise what was strange was that as the bubbles rise they shrink not just little bit but very noticeably at first assumed it was some kind of optical illusion but actually many bubbles shrink down to nothing and disappear how can this be where does the gas go surely it cant be dissolving into the liquid it cant happen that fast and the liquid would be saturated by now
18853 when an air filled balloon is released without its opening tied up it moves in circular path rather than straight line why is that
18889 remember learning this in high school but have forgotten it and cant seem to find it anywhere online air travels from areas of high pressure to low pressure correct so if have cold room in my house does the air move from the warm rooms to the cold room or the other way around
19043 am not talking about mirrors just plain window made of glass like material would it be possible to allow light pass only in one direction but not the other
19083 its very popular experiment eg from elementary school put burning candle on dish filled with water cover the candle with an inverted glass after little while the candle flame goes out and the water level inside the glass rises the standard explanation as recall it was that combustion burns oxygen and the consummed volume accounts for the extra water that goes inside the glass is this correct remember feeling years later uncomfortable with the explanation because to burn is certainly not to dissapear thought that oxygen combustion produces mainly co and hence one oxygen molecule would produce another co molecule and the volume would remain basically the same perhaps co dissolves into the water would doubt that to add to my confusion others state that the main cause is not the oxygen combustion but the changes of air temperature that decreases when the flame goes out and makes the air inside the glass contract which would rather invalidate the experiment as it was and is traditionally taught to students what is the right explanation image from here update as from webpage linked in accepted answer there are several effects here but its fair to say that the traditional explanation consumption of oxygen is wrong oxygen plus paraffin turn into co plus water representative reaction 38o to 25co 26h 2o this would account for small reduction in volume approx even assuming that this is the complete chemical picture its not and that water condenses co dissolves in water poorly and very slowly the main cause here is thermal expansion contraction of air
19195 if go camping and shout anywhere in the forest or on cliff usually hear the echo of my voice why when shout in my room do not hear any echoes
19295 need to calculate resistance in an electrical grid grid is graph edges of graph are resistors how calculate resistance between any two vertexes for arbitrary graph know kirchoff law and ohm law can calculate resistance between any points for given grid but not for arbitrary is there programs to solve this problem actually my goal is to write algorithm that calculate resistance for arbitrary graph any help is appreciated
19302 take our universe observations are consistent with relativity but not consistent with newtonian mechanics assume that our current relativistic model of gravitation is correct now increase to infinity experimental observations in this altered universe are still consistent with relativity by the assumption that relativity is correct are they now consistent with newtonian mechanics as well
19323 my first question is fairly basic but would like to clarify my understanding the second question is to turn this into something worth answering consider relativistic electron described by spinor wave function psi vec sigma and the dirac equation the conventional wisdom is that rotating everything by degrees will map the spinor to its negative psi mapsto psi however it appears to me that this statement is obviously false because rotation by is when viewed as an element of the group so3 exactly equal to the identity map and cannot map anything to its negative thus to make sense of the behavior of spin under rotation have to conclude the following the rotation group so3 does not act on the configuration hilbert space of electrons only its double cover su2 acts on the space of electrons is this interpretation correct so essentially there is symmetry group su2 which acts on physics but its action on the spatial degrees of freedom is just that of so3 what other groups even larger than su2 are there that could act on physics and are an extension of so3 is it possible to classify all possibilities in particular the ones that are not direct products of course gauge freedoms will give rise to direct products like so3 times u1 acting on space times electromagnetic potential but would consider these to be trivial extensions
19330 was reading michio kakus beyond einstein in it think he explains that when physicsts treat particle as geometric point they end up with infinity when calculating the strength of the particles field as you approach the particle first did get that part right second how does in very simple terms renormalization try to fix this in quantum mechanics if you can include some type of word picture that would be great accepted answer will go to the clearest explanation update got little further in the book lol and kaku talks about using symmetry to remove the divergences in the math id appreciate an answer that incorporates this also thanks guys
19361 ive been looking at few papers in experimental physics from the atlas collaboration for example and ive often run across phrases such as high electron what exactly is is it simply momentum but with the component parallel to the main beam projected off also why is as opposed to an important characteristic of particle in collision process
19378 when dirac found his equation for the electron gamma mu partial mu psi he famously discovered that it had negative energy solutions in order to solve the problem of the stability of the ground state of the electron he invoked paulis exclusion principle and postulated that negative energy states well already filled by sea of electrons this allowed him to predict the positron viewed as hole in the sea this interpretation was ultimately discarded owing to its inapplicability to bosons and difficulties with explaining the invisibility of the infinite charge of the sea according to my understanding the modern argument goes something like this there is discrete symmetry of the lagrangian called charge conjugation psi rightarrow psi which allows the negative energy solutions to be interpreted as positive energy solutions for second mode of excitation of the electron field with opposite charge called positrons the decay of electrons to positrons is then suppressed by the u1 gauge symmetry of the lagrangian forcing conservation of electrical charge according to this interpretation what dirac would have missed was the lagrangian formalism is this historically and physically correct
19405 in the simple explanation that black hole appears when big star collapses under missing internal pressure and huge gravity cant see any need to invoke relativity is this correct
19636 im quite familiar with sr but have very limited understanding in gr singularities and black holes my friend which is well read and is interested in general physics said that we can jump into another universe by entering black hole suppose that we and our equipments can withstand the tidal forces near black holes we jumped from our spaceship into black hole as we had passed the event horizon we couldnt send any information to the outside anymore can this situation be interpreted as that we were in another universe separate from our previous universe is there corrections or anything else to be added to above statement
19642 from what know in electromagnetic waves the components electric field and magnetic field generate each other magnetic field generated from moving electric charge generates another electric field and which also generates another magnetic field and so on thus creating an electromagnetic field so each of them gets weaker with distance which results in weaker emf am correct here
19690 how many colors do exist our perception as far as know colors are just different frequencies of light according to wikipedia we can see wavelengths from about nm und nm this means we can see light with frequency from about cdot hz to about cdot hz is this correct dont know if time and frequencies are discrete or continuous values if both are continuous an uncountable number of colors would exist if it is discrete there might still exist no upper bound an upper bound found the article orders of magnitude of frequencies the planck angular frequency seems to be by far higher than all other frequencies is this the highest frequency which is possible do higher frequencies make sense in physics why do ask this question am imagining the vector space mathbb like the mathbb but with colors need an infinite amount of colors if this should make sense in fact the number has to be uncountable
19731 see the phrase dynamical variable in several of my texts and they dont really define it google search doesnt yield much either have gathered that dynamical variable can be represented in terms of position and momentum and examples are velocity and kinetic energy but what is the definition
19747 not sure where to ask this question thought you guys would probably have the best idea today single key on my keychain in my pocket heated up so that it was too hot to handle and scalded my leg any ideas what could possibly have done this always keep prison guard style set of keys attached to my trousers and in my pocket one of these keys is very large and thick longer and thicker than my finger this is the key that heated up somehow in my pocket was my phone an htc desire hd was sitting at my desk as do all the working day when felt my pocket getting hotter rather alarmingly quickly stood up and pulled everything out of my pocket and cant work out how it happened the phone was not hot at all and worked fine my best guess is that there was some form of induction going on does anybody have any idea what might have happened dont think it was friction or bending of the keys as its never happened before and was sitting still all morning thanks for any ideas im more curious than anything else
19770 the poisson bracket is defined as fg sum left frac partial partial frac partial partial frac partial partial frac partial partial right the anticommutator is defined as ab ab ba the commutator is defined as ab ab ba what are the connections between all of them edit does the poisson bracket define some uncertainty principle as well
19775 wikipedia describes many variants of quantum field theory conformal quantum field theory topological quantum field theory axiomatic constructive quantum field theory algebraic quantum field theory are these approaches to the same thing or actually different
19802 the following image serves to aid the reader in understanding the privileged character of spacetime the wikipedia article on spacetime and the sub article the priveleged character of dimensional spacetime in particular made me think bit about the possibility that we might live in non integer amount of spatial and or time dimensions the notion of attaching non negative real number to metric space has at least mathematically already been described by such concepts as hausdorff dimension and minkowski bouligand dimension this may sound silly ignorant absurd to professional practicing theoretical physicists to me layman however it doesnt sound much stranger than the idea of wrapping up six extra dimensions which is from what understand considered to be serious possibility by those who study dimensional string theory into intricate shapes called calabi yau manifolds has any research on dimensional spacetime where ab in mathbb geq ever been done if so what where the findings if not why not
19813 this is problem that has bothered me for couple of weeks now and cant seem to wrap my head around it and understand it lets say we have planet with mass of we also have an object of relatively small mass so small that its gravitational field would not affect the planet and we know that at time it is at position if we know the acceleration due to gravity we can calculate the position at time over and we know that the acceleration due to gravity could be calculated over but since the acceleration depends on the position of the object relative to the planet and the position of the object is dependent on the acceleration this would obviously mean that the first formula wont work when we are working with displacement so large that it would change the acceleration significantly so in essence my question is what formula can we use to calculate the position of an object taking into consideration the change in acceleration due to gravity
19816 mc is the famous mass energy equation of albert einstein know that it tells that mass can be converted to energy and vice versa know that is energy is mass of matter and is speed of light in vacuum what didnt understood is how we will introduce speed of light atom bomb is made using this principle which converts mass into energy in that the mass is provided by uranium but where did speed of light comes into play how can speed of light can be introduced in atom bomb
19852 geometric algebra gives geometric meaning to linear algebra and much more it can provide coordinate free geometric interpretation of spaces those who learn of it tend to be dismayed they werent taught physics in this framework what are the pros and cons of replacing linear algebra and vector calcunningulus with geometric algebra good books on geometric algebra geometric algebra for computer science has exercises to self tests and features prettyfied pictures for extra clarity books by hestenes have an incredible signal to noise ratio extreme compression of information to shannon limit and are definitely must many introductions floating around remember search for geometric algebra and not algebraic geometry also try to see the pascal triangle structure of number of vector basis blades in dimensions
19860 can mathematics including statistics dynamical systems combined with classical electromagnetism using only the constants appearing in chargefree maxwell equations be used to derive the planck constant can it be proven that plancks constant is truly new physical constant
19886 where to find cross section data for pdgs cross section data listing does not include it
20003 im having trouble understanding the simple planetary model of the atom that im being taught in my basic chemistry course in particular cant see how negatively charged electron can stay in orbit around positively charged nucleus even if the electron actually orbits the nucleus wouldnt that orbit eventually decay cant reconcile the rapidly moving electrons required by the planetary model with the way atoms are described as forming bonds if electrons are zooming around in orbits how do they suddenly stop to form bonds understand that certain aspects of quantum mechanics were created to address these problems and that there are other models of atoms my question here is whether the planetary model itself addresses these concerns in some way that im missing and whether im right to be uncomfortable with it
20034 from what ive read on thorium reactors theres enormous benefit to them their fuel is abundant enough to power human civilization for centuries their fission products are relatively short lived theyre far less prone to catastrophic failure and they dont produce anything you could feasibly use as source of material for nuclear weapons so what technical issues need to be resolved so that thorium reactors become practical and put into wide use is it purely engineering issues that need to be overcome or are there problems of physics as well if so what are the technical problems and what research is occurring to overcome them if none of the problems that face thorium reactors are insurmountable then why arent they the focus of research and development that nuclear fusion is are there real environmental issues if so what are they
20071 maxwells equations specify two vector and two scalar differential equations that implies components in the equations but between vector fields vec xe ye and vec xb yb there are only unknowns so we have equations for unknowns why isnt this problem as far as know the answer is basically because the equations arent actually independent but ive never found clear explanation perhaps the right direction is in this article on arxiv apologies if this is repost found some discussions on physicsforums but no similar question here
20123 assume that the refrigerators temperature of degrees has something to do with the fact that water is densest at that temperature does that inhibit microbe growth but what about the freezer what is special about degrees is it trade off of some type
20157 if gravitons are also massless and neutrinos nearly so why arent pairs of either of them normally expected outcomes of electron positron annihilations are they possible but simply unlikely or is there actually some conserved quantity prohibiting their creation edit im talking about the low energy limit not in accelerator beam collisions

20259 what makes the beam of some lasers visible such as the ones used in clubs or such as the laser pointers sold at amazon which if pointed to the sky look like solid visible beam of light crossing the sky it reminds me of the lightsaber in star wars invisible such as the ones used in pointers for presentations
20331 im having trouble understanding the diagrams of elctromagnetic waves have no problem with any concept in classical mechanics and think this can be answered without any relativity which dont know yet hope for an answer which is as intuitive as possible but any answer will be good so in the common diagram of an electromagnetic wave what exactly do the vectors represent the wave is propagating though an eletromagnetic field are the lines just the field created by particle we learned in physics that charged particle creates field in all of space is this picture of changes in the field when it moves and if so how does it move does it move up and down with the amplitude of this wave lastly its not clear to me why the field part is not in the direction of the motion of the wave because usually an electric field is depicted as so it is in direction outwards from the source of the charge this is really running through my mind for some time so thanx for reading this
20333 couple of weeks ago was travelling in car km approximately and saw fly flying in front of me inside the car near my nose windows closed wonder how was that possible does it mean is really flying at km or the fly is being affected by some kind of gravity force
20371 recent research at ibm has found way to store bit of data in atoms while that is big accomplishment compared to what we have today it does seem like waste to non physics eye like me from this figure on the same page it looks like we can determine and based on the alignment of magnetic properties of atoms but why is smaller unit like just one atom not good enough
20401 we can imagine many changes to the laws of physics you could scrap all of electromagnetism gravity could be an inverse cubed law even the first law of thermodynamics could hypothetically be broken weve all imagined perpetual motion machines at one time or another however the second law of thermodynamics seems somehow more emergent it just springs out of the nature of our universe the effectively random movement of physical objects over time provided you have universe whose state is changing over time according to some set of laws it seems like the second law must be upheld things must gradually settle down into the state of greatest disorder what im particularly wondering is if you can prove in any sense perhaps using methods from statistical mechanics or is it possible to construct set of laws preferably similar to our own which would give us universe which could break the second law
20430 let be hilbert space and let hat be linear operator on my textbook states that hat psi rangle hat psi rangle my understanding of bra kets is that psi rangle is member of and that psi alone isnt defined to be anything so hat psi rangle isnt defined is hat psi rangle hat psi rangle just notation or is there something deeper that am missing
20437 tensors are mathematical objects that are needed in physics to define certain quantities have couple of questions regarding them that need to be clarified are matrices and second rank tensors the same thing if the answer to is yes then can we think of 3rd rank tensor as an ordered set of numbers in 3d lattice just in the same way as we can think of matrix as an ordered set of numbers in 2d lattice
20460 what are the key differences between gauge pressure and absolute pressure are there any other forms of pressure
20477 the electromagnetic force on charge is vec vec vec times vec the lorentz force but is this separate assumption added to the full maxwells equations the result of some empirical evidence or is it somewhere hidden in maxwells equations
20480 was wondering as its getting cold is it better for my electricity bill to shut down completely my electric heater during day and to turn it on again when come home then it will have to heat the room from something like to around or should keep the temperature around say while im away would naively guess its better off but im also wondering about inertia of the walls for instance
20604 in david griffithss introduction to electrodynamics the author gave the following problem in an exercise sketch the vector function vec frac hat and compute its divergence where hat frac vec qquad vec the answer may surprise you can you explain it found the divergence of this function as frac please tell me what is the surprising thing here
20619 am engineer who was taught the standard four semester two year physics courses from halliday and resnicks book however after reading the insightful answers here ron maimons awesome explanation of term in kinetic energy and some good books qed and weyls fantastic space time matter my eyes have opened to the possibilities of explaining deep physical knowledge from simple first principles so my question is why is undergraduate physics not taught more in an axiomatic fashion rigorously introduce the concepts of time and space like weyl does then introduce the galilean transformation and the concept of fields then proceed to show some powerful consequences of these one can argue the classic approach is more suited for engineers and related disciplines which probably is true but future physicists learn from the same books too which find to be amazing
20643 my parents told me to turn off the light when am not using it but remember my physics teacher told me that the action of turning on off light can cause huge energy am wondering how much is that someone said the energy caused by this action are enough to keep the light on for minutes if we require configuration here lets assume we use t8 light tube with 220v voltage from the house and 30w of the tube
20670 am asking this question here because think the answer has something to do with the way light is bent as its captured through the eye saw show while ago about tiny screens on contact lenses to pull up data on objects you see in the real world also just saw this article about google testing the same idea with screens in the lenses of sunglasses the part do not understand is how your eye would focus on screen that is so close my eyes and believe most others cannot focus on anything closer than couple inches away yet the lenses on glasses are much closer to the eye than couple inches so would guess they would have to use some special technology to separate the light rays in way that your brain could make an image from it if thats correct how would it work if not how would they get your eye to focus on screen so close
20675 okay so the trailer for the new spider man movie is out and appearently our friendly physicist from the neightborhood came up with something however cant find out what this is transcription begin align frac text log phi text alpha biggl biggl frac phi biggr beta biggr phi sum prod exp biggl frac j1 bigl1 bigr biggr log bigl cdots end align the last part is hidden dont think that its just jubberish and while my first guess was statistical physics or network theory it could as well go in the biology direction
20713 just curious if the possibility exists not necessarily spontaneously for photon with wavelength greater than the distance component of to be emitted and would this inherently violate the scalar
20726 keep hearing this rule that an object must have bigger size than the wavelength of light in order for us to see it and though dont have any professional relationship with physics want to learn the explanation for this also may have expressed my question wrong but hope you get the idea of what im trying to ask can you explain this as simple as possible for non physics person
20797 for the following quantities respectively could someone write down the common definitions their meaning the field of study in which one would typically find these under their actual name and most foremost the associated abuse of language as well as difference and correlation no pun intended propagator two point function wightman function greens function kernel linear response function correlation function covariance function maybe including side notes regarding the distinction between covariance covariance function and cross covariance the pair correlation function for different observables relations to the autocorrelation function the point function the schwinger function the relation to transition amplitudes retardation and related adjectives for greens functions and or propagators the heat kernel and its seemingly privileged position the spectral density spectra and the resolvent edit id still like to hear about the correlation fuction interpretation of the quantum field theoretical framework can transition amplitudes be seen as sort of auto correlation like such that the qft dynamics at hand just determine the structure of the temporal and spatial overlaps
20802 the many worlds interpretation suffer from at least wounds the preferred basis issue and perhaps the most notorious probability issue how do you make sense of probability in model where everything happens there are all these elaborate attempts at deriving born rule by wallace et al and at least different people at arxiv and there are some very good papers that provide criticism for these attempts but my question is why isnt gleasons theorem enough
20813 black hole power plant bhpp is something ill define here as machine that uses black hole to convert mass into energy for useful work as such it constitutes the 3rd kind of matter energy power formerly nuclear power humans have entertained the first two being fission and fusion putting aside the fact that the level of technological advancement needed for this is far beyond modern day humans it seems to be pretty well established that this is possible and maybe someday inevitable among physicists personally feel like dont understand the proposal because no one has really created coherent picture of how it would work to keep this focused here are my objective questions related to the conversion itself what mechanism of energy release are we talking about possibilities include radiation from accretion of material hawking radiation magnetic conversion of rotational energy and maybe others edit manishearths answer revealed that dont know the possibilities myself can we rule some of these out pragmatically how well are these mechanisms understood do we really have the physics observations to back them up or is it still on the forefront of physics how would the energy be harvested some possibilities include thermal cycle like rankine cycle radiation to electricity conversion like photovoltaics magnetically induced currents and charge movements could the particles of emission be too high energy to harness with known materials as part of the machine structure that would certainly apply to hawking radiation from small bhs do other options have the problem of overly energetic emissions related to application is there anything we could use to change the hawking radiation power output other than the bh mass would we be dancing on knifes edge by using hawking radiation as power source as you should know bh evaporation would be fairly major cosmic event and to get more power out one would have to use smaller bh which presents greater risk of catastrophe this problem could be mitigated by using several bhs so lower energy throughput would be needed for each but then that risks bh collision which is also catastrophic event does the spin charge or local gravitational potential affect the output is there any way for hawking radiation to be reasonably safe method of matter to energy conversion even for an advanced civilization what are the parameters for the total mass and energy output specifically what would the total energy output divided by mass be and what would the mass to energy conversion efficiency of new in falling material be for accretion ive heard numbers like of the in falling material can be converted to energy and ejected back into space at the poles but could we change and control that how would bhpps parameters compare to our sun and current earth based power plants sorry couldnt wrap this up into single question tried to address the on topic concern hear people mention that tokomak fusion power research still has many unknowns that are in the domain of physics as opposed to engineering which will come later in its development tried to edit my question above to be actually physics in nature think speak for most people when say that dont understand the vast majority of the physics of bhs my question here is generally how those physics would play out in machine that does useful matter to energy conversion
20825 understood the concept of apparent depth from here but one thing didnt understand is will there be difference in the real depth and apparent depth when we are looking not at an angle as shown above but vertically downward along the normal as shown in the figure below according to me real depth and apparent depth should be same because the light rays coming out of the object is not undergoing any refraction if im right then the answer to the question below must be but its 8m how come bird is flying above the surface of water if the bird is diving vertically down with speed his apparent velocity as seen by stationary fish underwater is
20832 am looking for site that publishing riddles and problems such as project euler publishes problems in computer science is there any similar site that is hardcore in the area of physics this site has some good problems set but it seems like there isnt community and sharing of solutions ideas like in project euler
20850 how can it be shown that turbulence occurs in fluid dynamics think people imply that it develops because of the text rot terms in the equations of motion the navier stokes equations but dont see how of course these cross derivatives are large for curled up vector field but why do these expressions force the fluid on an inward spiraly trajectory and then even multiples of these is there maybe an illustrative explicit calculation in two dimensions
20919 the thought randomly occurred to me that circular particle accelerator would have to exert lot of force in order to maintain the curvature of the trajectory many accelerators move particles at fully relativistic speeds and want to ask how that affects things why does this matter well if understand correctly particle in the lhc moving at would be dramatically more difficult to keep moving in the circle than particle moving at reading wikipedia was delighted to find fully specified problem within single paragraph http en wikipedia org wiki large hadron collider the lhc lies in tunnel kilometres mi in circumference as deep as metres ft beneath the franco swiss border near geneva switzerland its synchrotron is designed to collide opposing particle beams of either protons at up to teraelectronvolts tev or microjoules per nucleon or lead nuclei at an energy of tev per nucleus tev per nucleon can or google can calculate the proton case to come to in order to correctly calculate the force that the lhc must exert on it do need to start from dp dt or can get by with times the relativistic mass im not quite sure how to do the former question say have protons both moving so fast theyre going almost the speed of light but one has twice the energy of the other they move side by side and enter either an electric or magnetic field that causes them to accelerate perpendicular to the velocity vector is the radius of curvature mostly the same for the two or is it different by major factor like 5x 1x or 2x want to read some comments from people who understand these physics well the particles beyond certain energy are all going almost exactly the same speed is it still okay for me to say they have the same acceleration too they just happen to have absurdly huge inertia compared to the same particle at more modest fraction of the speed of light is this the correct perspective
20947 it is known that superconductor is material with electrical resistance zero my question is it is exactly zero theoretical zero or for practical realistic reasons it is effectively zero
20954 suppose we consider rigid body which has particles then the number of degrees of freedom is 3n mbox of constraints as the distance between any two points in rigid body is fixed we have choose constraints giving mbox 3n frac nn but as becomes large the second term being quadratic would dominate giving negative number how do we explain this negative degrees of freedom paradox
20962 do particles and anti particles attract each other from the very basic understanding that they are created out of nothing mutually and collide to annihilate each other seems to indicate this happens due to an attraction is it measurable force plus they are exactly alike except their opposite charge which would indicate attraction as this source indicates http www thenakedscientists com forum index phptopic id like more information on this if possible for the record im speaking about them under the construct of time if you ignore the construct of time both particles could actually be considered the same particle one moving backwards through time in loop that occurs once ignore this if you do not know what im talking about or feel free to correct me on it
21017 do you think it would be possible to get joules out of standard size mouse trap by my math it is torsion coefficient of or so out of the spring
21100 possible duplicate learn algebra and interpretation of qm im physics student its my last year and find my self struggling with usage of quantum mechanics now im starting to learn nuclear physics solid state physics and soon quantum field theory and see that have holes in my knowledge its not that im completely ignorant ive passed the exam in quantum physics understand the concepts but it doesnt feel right dont have the intuition like do for example classical mechanics or electrodynamics for example of course there are problems that cant solve in classical mechanics or electrodynamics but always know where to start have an intuition about the problem and in most scenarios have an ideas what solutions should look like but in quantum physics usually even for simple problems can get stuck or dont know where to start want to rebuild my knowledge from new source the literature ive used so far is introduction to quantum mechanics by david griffiths quantum physics by leonard schiff modern quantum mechanics revised edition by sakurai first one is an easy read good introduction but it doesnt use bra ket notation second on just didnt like it was hard to read short on examples third one really like but id like to see more examples and cant check solutions for problems at the end of the chapters anywhere could you please recommend me couple of more choices prefer books with lot of examples of solving problems also while its fine that book starts with wave functions solving schrodinger equations etc id like book that uses bra ket notation
21276 in vibrational spectroscopy only transitions between neighboring vibrational states delta nu pm nu being the vibrational quantum number are allowed within the harmonic approximation where does this selection rule come from have some ideas but havent come to satisfactory conclusion guess it has something to do with the transition dipole moment having to be nonzero this is given by begin equation left langle psi text final big hat mu big psi text initial right rangle end equation where hat mu is the dipole moment operator and psi text final and psi text initial are the wave functions of the final and the initial state respectively since the wave functions of the harmonic oscillator are even functions for nu 2n and odd functions for nu 2n with dots and hat mu transforms as vector and so can be considered an uneven function the integral for vanishes if psi text final and psi text initial are both even or uneven so if my ideas about the problem are correct please correct me if they arent would expect selection rule delta nu pm pm pm dots but why is it only delta nu pm
21301 for what longest possible time it was possible to hold light in closed volume with mirrored walls would be most interested for results with empty volume but results with solid state volume may be also interesting
21319 the event horizon of black hole is where gravity is such that not even light can escape this is also the point understand that according to einstein time dilation will be infinite for far away observer if this is the case how can anything ever fall into black hole in my thought experiment am in spaceship with powerful telescope that can detect light at wide range of wavelengths have it focused on the black hole and watch as large rock approaches the event horizon am correct in saying that from my far away position the rock would freeze outside the event horizon and would never pass it if this is the case how can black hole ever consume any material let alone grow to millions of solar masses if was able to train the telescope onto the black hole for millions of years would still see the rock at the edge of the event horizon am getting ready for the response of the object would slowly fade why would it slowly fade and if it would how long would this fading take if it is going to red shift at some point would the red shifting not slow down to standstill this question has been bugging me for years ok just an edit based on responses so far again please keep thinking from an observers point of view if observers see objects slowly fade and slowly disappear as they approach the event horizon would that mean that over time the event horizon would be lumpy with objects invisible but not passed through we should be able to detect the lumpiness should we not through
21336 what determines the color of light is it the wavelength of the light or the frequency if you put light through medium other than air in order to keep its color the same which one would you need to keep constant the wavelength or the frequency
21405 the world is full of nuclear warheads being stockpiled controlled fusion power seems long way away could we put these warheads to better use by exploding them in controlled way and capturing the energy they produce by useful work mean the power is then available for the national grid to boil kettles or have shower extra points for looking at the practicalities of building facility to do this although guess that would get the question closed
21595 the pauli spin matrices sigma begin smallmatrix end smallmatrix qquad qquad sigma begin smallmatrix end smallmatrix qquad qquad sigma begin smallmatrix end smallmatrix are mathematically symmetric in the sense that like and they can be universally exchanged with each other in several ways without altering any mathematical result however the visual forms for these three matrices are unexpectedly diverse only sigma uses and my understanding of physics history is that pauli and also dirac developed his matrices by trial and error rather than by applying any specific theory does deeper theoretical explanation exist for why these very different visual representations of spin are nonetheless interchangeable in multiple ways
21669 im happy to accept and use conservation of energy when im solving problems at uni but im curious about it to for all of my adult life and most of my childhood ive been told this law must hold true but not what it is based on on what basis do we trust conservation of energy
21677 this question is related but my question here is much more elementary than discussions of the pauli principle across the universe there has been fair amount of discussion around at the moment on the double well potential model in quantum mechanics the question have here is just concerned with some very simple basic schoolboy quantum mechanics that you need to get right in order to progress with the discussions think these questions would be too elementary for physicist to ask fortunately im not physicist so my embarrassment is under control the scenario is this have double square finite depth potential well with large distance separating the wells call them left hand and right hand wells the model want to use is elementary nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the energy eigenstates of such system are similar to those of single well but what was one energy eigenstate now becomes two with incredibly closely spaced energy levels ref suppose have two electrons in this system in the two very closely spaced lowest levels and the two electrons are indistinguishable so the state is over sqrt rangle rangle rangle rangle the statement that has often been made in these discussions is something like an observer in the left hand well now makes an energy measurement of an electron and gets the value in talking about this scenario in the link gave above sean carroll stated imagine that we have such situation with two electrons in two atoms in mutually entangled state we measure our electron to be in energy level is it true that we instantly know that our far away friend will measure their electron to be in energy level yes absolutely true this is where im confusing myself by assumption our system was in an energy eigenstate and weve made an ideal energy measurement so by the rules of quantum mechanics after the measurement it ends up still in an energy eigenstate after the measurement but the observer knows that we have double well two fermion system and the correct system state is still the antisymmetrized one over sqrt rangle rangle rangle rangle so for an idealized measurement the system started in this state and remained in this state so ask question if the measurement proceeds like this without any extra entanglement introducing mechanism wont the observer think if my far away friend now makes an energy measurement hell have chance of getting or in other words since this is non relativistic qm the particle could have moved to the other well immediately after the first measurement so the state is still antisymmetrized over the particle identities in other other words the state described isnt mutually entangled just antisymmetrized over the electron identities question if this correct then how typically would introduce some entanglement between the electrons as in seans statement finally when we say an observer in the left well makes an energy measurement doesnt this introduce some locality into the picture for the following reason what it implies is that the observers measuring equipment is spatially localized in the left well so that when an energy measurement is made there is also an implied acquisition of information about the measured electrons location at that time so come to question wouldnt this mean that after such local measurement the measured electron cannot be in one of the systems energy eigenstates so the system state would be something like over sqrt psi rangle rangle rangle psi rangle where psi is spatially localized state concentrated in the lh well this doesnt sound right where is my reasoning going wrong
21678 read this answer while ago and while thinking about nabla realized something since the cross product can be written as determinant in higher dimensions we require extra vector inputs iirc its called the wedge product in higher dimensions alright how does this work when we generalize maxwell to higher dimensions curl can be written abuse of notation yes as cross product with nabla but to generalise it to higher dimensions we need multiple inputs we need something like nabla mathbf mathbf in four dimensions and so on so we have two ways to get out of this we can either use different way to write curl in multiple dimensions the wikipedia page has stuff on this which dont understand or there are more than one and fields in higher dimensions so which is it how are maxwells laws generalised to higher dimensions just note never understood the linked answer after the first sentence didnt know enough so if theres something obvious there that answers this question missed it know nothing of higher dimensional analysis so if complex notation is going to be unavoidable for the multiple dimensions id be fine if you showed me what happens in four dimensions
21753 what is the explanation between equality of proton and electron charges up to sign this is connected to the gauge invariance and renormalization of charge is connected to the renormalization of photon field but is this explanation enough do we have some experimental evidence that quarks have and charges by the way think about bare charge of electron and proton and am also wondering if this can be explained by standard model
21814 in wolfgang pauli wrote letter to lise meitner for convention in bingen considering the problem of beta decay does anybody know where to find the original letter online
21830 charged particle undergoing an acceleration radiates photons lets consider charge in freely falling frame of reference in such frame the local gravitational field is necessarily zero and the particle does not accelerate or experience any force thus this charge is free in such frame but free charge does not emit any photons there seems to be paradox does freely falling charge in gravitational field radiate
21866 undergraduate classical mechanics introduces both lagrangians and hamiltonians while undergrad quantum mechanics seems to only use the hamiltonian but particle physics and more generally quantum field theory seem to only use the lagrangian you hear about the klein gordan lagrangian dirac lagrangian standard model lagrangian and so on why is there mismatch here why does it seem like only hamiltonians are used in undergraduate quantum mechanics but only lagrangains are used in quantum field theory
21877 my question is is there simple and truly general equation for the resistance between two electrical equipotential surfaces obviously if so what is it and if not why it would be very difficult to solve granted but just want to see calculus equation that is fully descriptive have two frameworks under which this could be entertained ill write those out and then explain the motivation to start with we need propose that the volume separating the two surfaces has volumetric resistivity rho in units of omega single volume framework we can limit the discussion to defined volume then the surfaces reside in that volume or on the surface of it this volume may have constant resistivity rho while everywhere outside the volume is completely electrically insulating infinite volume framework an alternative to the above approach that might make the task more or less difficult would be to replace constant resistivity with spatial dependence rho vec and no longer require boundary condition in that case we only have mathematical inputs to the problem which is the resistivity defined for all vec and definition of the two surfaces and known algebraic analogs the basic algebraic formulation that find insufficient is rho frac ell where is the length of the restive material that is any shape which has translation symmetry over that length and is the cross sectional area obviously this is rather simple equation that wont apply to more complicated geometry even more sophisticated academic sources seem to give equations that fall short of what im asking for example rho int frac ax dx think its obvious that an equation such as this is built upon myriad of assumptions for thought experiment imagine that the area starts out as very small and then pans out to very large quickly well accounting for the larger area in the above sense underestimates the resistance because the charge has to diffuse out perpendicular to the average direction of flow as well as parallel to it have some reasons to suspect this might actually be rather difficult big reason is that all the approaches im familiar with require the flow paths to be established beforehand which cant be done for what im asking so maybe this will result in two interconnected calculus equations motivation had an interest in squishy circuits and it occurred to me that cant quickly and simply write down the equation for resistance between two points the unique thing about squishy circuits is that it calls for two types of dough one that conducts and one that is mostly insulating however the recipes arent perfect and because of that the young children who play with these circuits regularly encounter the limits of conductor and insulator definitions if you make your conductor dough too long and or too thin you will encounter dimming of the light you connect with it similarly thin insulator layer will lead to lot of leakage current which also dims the light
21882 in my scant spare time im building an asteroids game you know little ship equipped with pea shooter and bunch of asteroids floating around everywhere waiting to be to blown up but wanted to add little twist wouldnt it be cool if newtonian gravity was in effect and you could do thinks like enter into an orbit around an asteroid and fire at it or shoot gravity assisted bankshots around massive asteroid so that you can shoot one behind it but the problem is that in asteroids space is topologically toroidal if you fly off of the top of the screen you reappear at the same coordinate at the bottom of the screen and similarly for the right of the screen so how does one calculate the distance between two bodies in this space really realize that this question doesnt make sense because body would pull upon body from variety of directions each with their corresponding distances but anyway the main questions how would newtonian gravity work in toroidal space and is there any applicability to the answer to this question outside of my game
21903 week or so back asked question about the gravitational potential field phi frac gm qquad neq and how to show the laplacian of phi equals zero for neq eventually it took while was able to understand that nabla cdot nabla phi gm left frac 2x 2y 2z leftx right right qquad neq which was revelation but now im wondering why poissons equation nabla cdot nabla phi nabla phi pi rho doesnt always equal zero as well obviously it doesnt so im assuming that inside mass the gravitational potential field cannot be given by phi frac gm qquad neq is that correct also is there comparably easy formula for gravitational potential inside mass or does it vary horribly depending on the shape and density of the mass
21933 can conceive of particle existing in empty spacetime but not wave wave appears to me at least to insist upon medium for its very definition understand that the 19c physicists postulated the lumineferous aether for this very reason but abandoned it in favour of the electromagnetic field in the textbooks ive looked at its always said that the physicists eventually understood that wave does not necessarily require medium but it seems to me tht they abandoned the idea of medium mechanically conceived assume because of the high prestige of newtonian mechanics its status as defining fundamental paradigm which privileges our naive intuitive understanding of mechanical phenonema for medium conceived in more general manner afterall this field permeates spacetime and its state evolves through time this is how would naively conceive of medium in general sense should add this is maybe more of history of physics question and ive added tag as such to stop people getting upset
21942 this is my hey ive noticed that too question for the week if you stack two plastic ice cube trays with water in them in freezer the resulting ice cubes in the top tray will usually come out cleanly and easily while the those in the bottom tray will stick and crack try it so why summarized answer ice expands as it freezes so if freezing starts at the top surface of the water the liquid water below it allows the cube to edge gently upwards as it freezes without much stress on it this same upwards edging effect also keeps the ice from every gaining solid hold on the entire surface of the tray result the top surface of the ice cube stays flat and the cube comes out of the tray easily without cracking conversely if freezing starts from below at the tray surface the freezing water has the time and opportunity to lock itself tightly to all parts of that surface but as the ice continues to grow inward it tries to expand from all sides at once into the internal space this creates lot of stress in the ice and causes the cube to form peak at the top due to the internally expanding ice having no place else to go so since the ice has both had ample opportunity to freeze tightly to all of the tray surface and because it was stressed internally as the freezing progressed the ice cube becomes disaster when you try to get it out much of it sticks to the tray and the parts that do come out are often cracked how is all of this connected to whether tray is stacked on top or bottom its because stacked trays almost always impedes the cold air of the freezer from getting between the trays that causes the stacked trays to behave largely like single unit with freezing occurring from the outside of that two tray unit the top tray therefore freezes mostly from the top down producing ice cubes that have flat surfaces and come out easily the bottom tray freezes mostly from the bottom up through the surface of the tray and so ends up producing peaked ice cubes that stick to the tray and crack when you try to remove them see the next addendum for some actual experiments you can do to try to confirm this ron maimons was the first one to figure this out see his accepted answer for details addendum heres an experimental prediction based on ron maimons answer if the ice cubes have flat tops they will come out easily conversely if the ice cubes have central peaks they will crack badly when you remove them see the answer summary above for why based on the answer this experiment should make ice cubes come out easier tape an empty tray to the bottom of the tray with water in it this will create an air tight insulating air pocket below the filled tray and so should result in flat topped ice that comes out of the top tray easily you can also try for he opposite result by taping tray upside down over the top of the tray with water in it when it is done freezing the ice cubes should be strongly peaked and should stick and crack when you try to remove them so anyone interested get crackin
21955 consider this penny on my desc it is particular piece of metal well described by statistical mechanics which assigns to it state namely the density matrix rho frac beta in the simplest model this is an operator in space of functions depending on the coordinates of huge number of particles the ignorance interpretation of statistical mechanics the orthodoxy to which all introductions to statistical mechanics pay lipservice claims that the density matrix is description of ignorance and that the true description should be one in terms of wave function any pure state consistent with the density matrix should produce the same macroscopic result howewer it would be very surprising if nature would change its behavior depending on how much we ignore thus the talk about ignorance must have an objective formalizable basis independent of anyones particular ignorant behavior on the other hand statistical mechanics always works exclusively with the density matrix except in the very beginning where it is motivated nowhere except there one makes any use of the assumption that the density matrix expresses ignorance thus it seems to me that the whole concept of ignorance is spurious relic of the early days of statistical mechanics thus id like to invite the defenders of orthodoxy to answer the following questions can the claim be checked experimentally that the density matrix canonical ensemble say which correctly describes macroscopic system in equilibrium describes ignorance if yes how and whose ignorance if not why is this ignorance interpretation assumed though nothing at all depends on it ii in though experiment suppose alice and bob have different amounts of ignorance about system thus alices knowledge amounts to density matrix rho whereas bobs knowledge amounts to density matrix rho given rho and rho how can one check in principle whether bobs description is consistent with that of alice iii how does one decide whether pure state psi is adequately represented by statistical mechanics state rho in terms of ii assume that alice knows the true state of the system according to the ignorance interpretation of statistical mechanics pure state psi corresponding to rho psi psi whereas bob only knows the statistical mechanics description rho rho presumably there should be kind of quantitative measure rho rho ge that vanishes when rho rho and tells how compatible the two descriptions are otherwise what can it mean that two descriptions are consistent however the mathematically natural candidate the relative entropy kullback leibler divergence rho rho the trace of rho log frac rho rho edit corrected sign mistake pointed out in the discussion below does not work indeed in the situation iii rho rho equals the expectation of beta log in the pure state this is minimal in the ground state of the hamiltonian but this would say that the ground state would be most consistent with the density matrix of any temperature an unacceptable condition edit after reading the paper http bayes wustl edu etj articles gibbs paradox pdf by jaynes pointed to in the discussion below can make more precise the query in iii in the terminology of there the density matrix rho represents macrostate while each wave function psi represents microstate the question is then when may or may not microstate psi be regarded as macrostate rho without affecting the predictability of the macroscopic observations in the above case how do compute the temperature of the macrostate corresponding to particular microstate psi so that the macroscopic behavior is the same if it is and which criterion allows me to decide whether given psi this approximation is reasonable an example where it is not reasonable to regard psi as canonical ensemble is if psi represents composite system made of two pieces of the penny at different temperature clearly no canonical ensemble can describe this situation macroscopically correct thus the criterion sought must be able to decide between state representing such composite system and the state of penny of uniform temperature and in the latter case must give recipe how to assign temperature to psi namely the temperature that nature allows me to measure the temperature of my penny is determined by nature hence must be determined by microstate that claims to be complete description of the penny have never seen discussion of such an identification criterion although they are essential if one want to give the idea underlying the ignorance interpretation that completely specified quantum state must be pure state part of the discussion on this is now at http chat stackexchange com rooms discussion between arnold neumaier and nathaniel edit march accepted nathaniels answer as satisfying under the given circumstances though he forgot to mention fouth possibility that prefer namely that the complete knowledge about quantum system is in fact described by density matrix so that microstates are arbitrary density matrces and macrostate is simply density matrix of special form by which an arbitrary microstate density matrix can be well approximated when only macroscopic consequences are of interest these special density matrices have the form rho with simple operator in the equilibrium case linear combination of and vaiious number operators if conserved defining the canonical or grand canonical ensemble this is consistent with all of statistical mechanics and has the advantage of simplicity and completeness compared to the ignorance interpretation which needs the additional qualitative concept of ignorance and with it all sorts of questions that are too imprecise or too difficult to answer
22010 when was in the university in the late 90s circa was told there had been research investigating the the square of distance in the newtons law of universal gravitation frac 1m maybe model like frac 1m with slightly different from let say or fits some experimental data better is that really true or did misunderstand something
22018 absence of magnetic charges is reflected in one of maxwells fundamental equations operatorname div vec tag1 this equation allows us to introducte concept of vector potential vec operatorname rot vec using this concept it is possible to express maxwells equations in graceful symmetric form nabla vec frac frac partial vec partial frac vec epsilon tag2 nabla phi frac frac partial phi partial frac rho epsilon tag3 noticing that vector vec and scalar phi potentials as well as electric current density vec and charge density rho form vector in minkovsky space time therefore maxwells equations can be expressed in covariant form using dalembertian nabla mu nabla mu nu frac nu epsilon tag4 if magnetic monopols exist maxwells equation will look as operatorname div vec mu rho mathrm magnet as the divergence of vec isnt equal to zero it impossible to introduce concept of vector potential thus the equation in the form of will not be possible to express
22030 was reading gizmodo the other day and didnt quite understand the physics behind this could anybody shed some light on how this effect actually works
22075 in the usual derivation of plancks radiation law the energies or frequencies omega of the oscillators depend on the measurements of the black body the model is such that the only characteristic energy is given by these oscillator excitations and in terms of the temperature also the oscillation amplitude vanishes on the walls specifically the structure of the atom walls doesnt enter the computation after all thats pretty much the definition of black body my question are there computations maybe qed statistical physics for more realistic systems which might model the interaction of photons with the wall atoms and which give results such that one can see the limiting case to an ideal black body the question came up when wondered about the theory behind emission and absorptions of photons on the walls of black body
22116 suppose you have dynamics of coherent state the state presents normal distribution of finding the particle does anyone know of any attempts to connect modern advances in the probability theory to quantum dynamics of coherent state
22151 wish to describe in simple but correct terms the analogy between the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa cmk and pontecorvo maki nakagawa sakata pmns matrices the cmk matrix describes the rotation between weak interaction eigenmodes and the flavour mass eignstates of quarks the pmns matrix is the rotation between neutrino flavour states and the time evolution mass eigenstates both are unitary and experimentally known are the following two statements correct quark masses are large compared to amplitudes of the flavour mixing weak interaction thus the effect of flavour oscillations is negligible and manifested mainly as decays of higher mass quarks in the weak channel on the other hand the differences in neutrino eigenenergies are comparable to the mixing amplitudes thus the contrast of oscillations is high the interaction responsible for the cmk matrix is the weak interaction while the interaction responsible for pmns and neutrino oscillations is unknown due to non observability or any other of its effects this answer sheds some very useful light on point no but im not sure whether the non renormalizable dimension operators mentioned there can be unambitious classified as different in some well defined sense from the weak interaction or not
22201 consider some positive charge that is distributed uniformly over very long line along the axis if am stationary with respect to the line then there is only static electric field which has cylindrical symmetry assume now that am moving with some constant velocity which has only positive component along the axis with respect to me there is now current running down the negative axis hence expect to find static magnetic field in my moving inertial frame my question is do still find static electric field as well in this case because on one hand find the answer to be no since static electric fields should come only from static charges and the charges here will not be static on the other hand although the line carries current the line is still charged which is different from currents running in conducting wires where the wires are neutral at all times that means the answer is yes and one expects to see static electric field because the line is continuously charged so is the answer yes or no and why
22204 why is allowed decompose the spacetime metric into spatial part temporal part like this for example ds an adt 2n adtdx ab dx adx is called lapse is the shift vector and ab is the spatial part of the metric in order to arrive at hamiltonian formulation of gr how is breaking of lorentz invariance avoided by doing this sorry it this is dumb question maybe should just read on to get it but im curious about this now
22249 all right know there must be an elementary proof of this but am not sure why never came across it before adding total time derivative to the lagrangian or 4d divergence of some vector in field theory does not change the dynamics because the variation can be assumed to be zero on the boundary and integrated away but dont see why any arbitrary function as long as it is well behaved no discontinuities etc cant be written as total derivative or 4d divergence in fact know that any nice scalar function in 3d can be written as 3d divergence of some vector field since for any 3d charge distribution there exists an electric field whose divergence is equal to the charge function because of gauss law but if can write any function as total derivative or divergence of some vector than can add any function to the lagrangian and get the same dynamics which means the lagrangian is completely arbitrary which makes no sense at all so my question is why cant an arbitrary function as long as it is well behaved no discontinuities etc be written as total derivative of some other function or divergence of vector
22306 the wavefunction of free electrons is variously described as plane wave or wave packet am fairly happy with the wave packet as it is localised but if we change to the electrons rest frame then there is no direction of motion and thus the wavefunction must be isotropic presumably as gaussian wavepacket yet the wavepacket supposedly expands over time in real space permitting it to drop in energy in momentum space does this mean that the free electron wavefunction is not stable in its own frame will it simply expand ad infinitum until it interacts with another particle if the electron can continue to expand arbitrarily then the probability that it retains its original momentum grows vanishingly small which would deny conservation of momentum for any free particle with significant path length
22357 was reading in the papers how some airline or the other increased their prices for extra luggage citing increased fuel costs now im bit skeptical using the wrong bernoulli effect explanation of lift get this more luggage implies more lift needed implies more speed needed not implies more fuel needed at this point im only analysing the cruise situation when the plane is accelerating this will come into effect but more on that later now know that the correct description of lift involves the coanda effect and conservation of momentum but dont know it well enough to analyse this also there will be drag forces which havent and dont know how to factored in can see that viscosity must be making change otherwise planes wouldnt need engines once theyre up there but dont know how significant 1kg increase of weight would be so my question is are airlines justified in equating extra baggage to fuel bonus questions if more baggage means more fuel approximately what should the price be for each extra kilo of baggage what happens when we consider takeoff and landing does heavier plane have to use significantly large amount of fuel
22377 when light wave enters medium with higher refractive index from air to standard glass and its speed decreases why does that make it refract bend understand that wavelength decreases and frequency stays the same and therefore its speed decreases but cant find anywhere whatsoever why the speed decrease cause the wave to refract so could someone please explain this
22409 im interested in quantum mechanics book that uses high level mathematics not only the usual functional analysis and the theory of generalised functions but the theory of pseudodifferential operators etc certainly the modern mathematics if there isnt something similar please give me reference to the book that is strictly supported by mathematics given set of mathematically descripted axioms author develops the theory using mathematics as main tool
22542 have read and heard in number of places that extra dimension might be as big as mm what im wondering is the following how is length assigned to these extra dimensions mean you can probably not get your ruler out and compare with the extent of an extra dimension directly can you so if not how can you compare one dimension with the other does one have some sort of canonical metric could one also assign length in meters to time in this way
22559 it is said that string theory is unification of particle physics and gravitation is there reasonably simple explanation for how the standard model arises as limit of string theory how does string theory account for the observed particle spectrum and the three generations edit march in the mean time read the paper arxiv suggested in the answer by john rennie my impression from reading this paper is that string theory currently does not predict any particular particle content and that to get close to derivation of the standard model one must assume that string theory reduces at low energies to susy gut if this is correct wouldnt this mean that part of what is to be predicted is instead assumed thus one would have to wait for specific prediction of the resulting parameters in order to see whether or not string theory indeed describes particle physics some particular observations quotes substantiating the above looks like input from the standard model the masses of the superparticles after are apparently freely chosen to yield the subsequent prediction this sort of arguments only shows that some susy gut and hence perhaps string theory is compatible with the standard model but has no predictive value the authors impose an intermediate so10 susy gut as discussed earlier in section random searches in the string landscape suggest that the standard model is very rare this may also suggest that string theory cannot make predictions for low energy physics perhaps string theory can be predictive if we understood the rules for choosing the correct position in the string landscape so my followup question is is the above impression correct or do lack information available elsewhere edit march ron maimons answer clarified to some extent what can be expected from string theory but leaves details open that in my opinion are needed to justify his narrative upon his request posted the new questions separately as more questions on string theory and the standard model
22577 always get the doubt about this know that bike measures its speed based on the motion of its front wheel so what is the case with train is it same principle then what about an airplane is it by radars
22578 black hole is so powerful to suck everything into itself so is it possible that mini black holes can be created if not then we could have actively disproved the rumors spread during lhc experiment
22618 heard its is pretty tough to get results for more than few quantum particles are quantum mechanical calculations useful at all for any technology that is being sold or do they use quasi classical results at most is there hope that advances in qm calculations would make any change to the technological world im basically considering everything that could make change to our life disregarding pure theoretical research results which path of qm advances could potentially be the most yielding in terms of practical results edit from what experienced experiments are already producing results when theorists are still trying to fit their theories to the data so why do you need the theoretical calculations then do they have predictive power that would be found easier and more precise with experiments
22665 id like to know what are the differences in timbre or the acoustic properties of sound that allow us to differentiate between sound which is quiet but close by and one which is far away for example you can tell when someone near to you is playing an instrument quietly even without looking to see where they are they dont sound far away hearing loud gig or car stereo playing from the next street doesnt sound like its quiet it sounds loud but far away but other times we cant differentiate sometimes hear siren on tv and think its on the street thought only the amplitude volume of sound wave diminished with distance does the shape frequency alter too is this ability just to do with having two ears to locate the source surely someone who is deaf in one ear can still tell an orchestra is playing diminuendo and not gradually getting further away

22792 ive just stumbled about sentence which says that high curvature of spacetime implies that any matter present is at high temperature this somehow confuses me so my probably dumb questions are how is this general relationship between the temperature of matter and curvature of spacetime derived or explained just looking at einsteins field equations dont see why there cant be some cold mass just sitting there leading to large curvature is this relationship generally valid or is its domain of applicability restricted somehow for example has the curvature of spactime to be so large that quantum effects kick in and it has something to do with the uncertainty principle
22795 this is followup question to how does string theory reduce to the standard model ron maimons answer there clarified to some extent what can be expected from string theory but left details open that in my opinion are needed to justify his narrative let me state what his answer suggested to me based on some indirect evidence it is conjectured that one day string theory produces in one of the many possible low energy approximations theory equivalent to the standard model or slight variation of it ii string theory cannot predict that the universe must be in this low energy approximation as the actual low energy approximation is random result of stochastic dynamics and hence as unpredictable as the masses and distances of sun and planets in the solar system iii in particular the phenomenological input needed roughly corresponding to boundary conditions in classical theory includes the qualitative structure of the standard model plus the susy plus say decimal place data on parameters from this it is conjectured that infinitely accurate values of all parameters in the standard model are determined by string theory support for these conjectures is matter of belief to me none of the three statements is so far plausible can be supported only by finding such an approximation what other finding could support this conclusion ii is quite different from what we see at lower energies for example while we cannot predict the shape of particular bunch of water we can derive completely all macroscopic low energy properties of water from microscopic principle and few constants defining the microscopic laws masses of and the electron and the fine structure constant and the parameters of the standard model define in principle the properties of all nuclei though we havent yet good enough numerical methods what makes string theory unique in that not only the particular low energy states but also the low energy dynamical laws are random results iii could only be substantiated if it could be shown at least for some of the many low energy approximations that knowing some numbers to low pecision fixes all coupling constants in theory to arbitrary precision is there such case so that one could study the science behind this claim also iii is somewhat disappointing as it means that most of the potential insight an underlying theory could provide must already be assumed quite unlike newtons theory which is indispensible to derive from few dozen constants the complete motion of the planets or quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics which are indispensible to derive from few dozen constants all properties of macroscopic materials string theory does not provide similar service for elementary particle theory as quantum field theory already contains all machinery needed to draw the empirical consequences from the qualitative structure of the standard model plus the susy plus say decimal place data on parameters
22842 the pressure for the ultrarelativistic bose gas is 3v propto kt hc it looks to me like it diverges for to looking at the derivation it diverges because is the unit volume in phase space and letting it go to zero allows for an infinite number of states per volume but dont understand the physics my question is threefold is it correct that the pressure diverges in the limit to or is there some hidden dependence that ive missed is this indeed the right classical limit if not what is what does that mean physically
22876 know photon has zero rest mass but it does have plenty of energy since energy and mass are equivalent does this mean that photon or more practically light beam exerts gravitational pull on other objects if so does it depend on the frequency of the photon
22916 in reading through old course material found the assignment my translation show that single photon cannot produce an electron positron pair but needs additional matter or light quanta my idea was to calculate the wavelength required to contain the required energy mev which turned out to be times nm but dont know about any minimum wavelength of electromagnetic waves cant motivate it with the conservation laws for momentum or energy either how to solve this task

23197 actually im learning string theory and one of its proposals is that there are actually dimensions of which only are visible to us and the remaining are curled up however superstring theory says that there are dimensions and theory says dimensions im having trouble imagining curled up dimensions is it that we go out of the universe to see 4th dimension this was suggested by friend of mine
23295 ive read something about this and conclude that it happens because of the uncertainty principle but dont understand very well the meaning of that mean its very abstract that the speed vec and position vec of particle cant be known at the same time dont understand that statement

23399 post below on the bishop hill blog relating to climate change asserts that no warming effect can be attributed to mathrm co dont know whether the author is really physicist but it sounds impressive planck spectra and black body radiation etc can someone explain in laymans language whether the assertions are valid quote from http www bishop hill net blog greenhouse reversal html there is no greenhouse so it cant be reversed many so called skeptics are not really basing their arguments on the true physics of the atmosphere by failing to do so they are demonstrating that they also have fallen for the ipcc bluff that radiation from cooler atmosphere including so called backradiation but also initial radiation can transfer thermal energy to warmer surface this is not correct physics and the sooner this is made clear to the public the better true physics backed up by basic phenomena such as the fact that radiation in microwave oven is not absorbed in the usual sense of the word shows why this is the case no one has ever proved anything to the contrary in any empirical experiment and never will the only thing any such radiation from the atmosphere can do is slow down that third or so of surface cooling which occurs by way of radiation that does not escape to space via the atmospheric window radiation from the atmosphere can have absolutely no effect on evaporative cooling chemical processes or sensible heat transfer these non radiative components plus the radiation to space make up about of all surface cooling furthermore the effect of carbon dioxide with its limited frequencies is far less than true blackbody and less per molecule than water vapor no gas can radiate outside its planck spectrum more than true blackbody and so there is no way that carbon dioxide in molecules can contribute very large amount of radiation anyway the other cooling processes merely accelerate and compensate for any minuscule slowing of radiative cooling thus there is absolutely no warming attributable to carbon dioxide it is time for skeptics to get their facts right and stop giving in to part of the hoax only truth will prevail in the long run edit the author of the blog post was doug cotton who has published related paper at http principia scientific org publications psi radiated energy pdf and has website at http climate change theory com

23725 in new scientist magazine published an article titled relativity drive the end of wings and wheels1 about the emdrive wikipedia which stirred up fair degree of controversy and some claims that new scientist was engaging in pseudo science since the original article the inventor claims that technology transfer contract with major us aerospace company was successfully completed and that papers have been published by professor yang juan of the north western polytechnical university xian china furthermore it was reported in wired magazine that the chinese were going to attempt to build the device assuming that the inventor is operating in good faith and that the device actually works is there another explanation of the claimed resulting propulsion notes direct links to the article may not work as it seems to have been archived the abstracts provided on the emdrive website claim that they are chinese language journals which makes them very difficult to chase down and verify

23797 if youve ever been annoyingly poked by geek you might be familiar with the semi nerdy obnoxious response of im not actually touching you the electrons in the atoms of my skin are just getting really close to yours expanding on this little bit it seems the obnoxious geek is right after all consider zenos paradox every time you try to touch two objects together you have to get them halfway there then quarter way etc in other words theres always infinitesimal distance in between the two objects atoms dont touch each other even the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom arent touching each other so what does it mean for two objects to touch each other are atoms that join to form molecule touching suppose the atoms are touching because their is some overlap but the subatomic particles are just whizzing around avoiding each other if this is the case should touching just be defined relative to some context if touch your hand our hands are touching but unless you pick up some of my dna the molecules in our hands arent touching and since the molecules arent changing the atoms arent touching either is there really no such thing as touching

24001 am wondering if the mass density profile rho vec has been characterized for atomic particles such as quarks and electrons am currently taking an intro class in quantum mechanics and have run this question by several professors it is my understanding from the viewpoint of quantum physics particles position is given by probability density function psi vec also understand that when books quote the radius of an electron they are typically referring to some approximate range into which an electron is likely to fall say one standard deviation from the expectation value of its position or maybe meters however it is my impression that in this viewpoint wherever the particle is or even whether or not the particle had any position to begin with via the bell inequalities it is assumed that if it were somehow found it would be point mass this has been verified by my professors and gsis am wondering if its really true if the particle was truly point mass then wherever it is it would presumably have an infinite mass density wouldnt that make electrons and quarks indistinguishable from very tiny black holes is there any practical difference between saying that subatomic particles are black holes and that they are point masses am aware of such problems as hawking radiation although at the scales of the schwarchild radius of an electron back of the envelope calculation yields tilde meters would it really make any more sense to use quantum mechanics as opposed to general relativity if anyone knows of an upper bound on the volume over which an electron quark gluon anything else is distributed would be interested to know quick google search has yielded nothing but the classical electron radius which is not what am referring to thanks in advance look forward to the responses
24110 first of all it is my understanding that the problems one encounters with the non renormalizability of gravity are very similar if not the same as one encounters in any non renormalizable theory as long as you are doing your calculations well below the scale that suppresses irrelevant operators your calculations should make sense as you approach that scale that suppresses irrelevant operators there is new physics that comes in at that scale if you try to push your effective theory to the scale of new physics perturbation theory will break down this to my knowledge is the story that underlies the failure of fermi theory that necessitates introducing bosons and the failure of the standard model with out higgs that necessitates the introduction of higgs my questions is is gravity priori any different then the above scenarios that is we need new physics to come in at the planck scale to uv complete the theory or put it another way unitarize graviton scattering but could it be as simple as one to few new particles or for other reasons does it have to be something as drastic as string theory or loop quantum gravity by drastic mean paradigm shifts where its not some small modification to the current theory consisting of few new particles but more of an complete overhaul
24192 am an amateur learning about the higgs because was interested in what the lhcs purpose is read that as particle passes through space it is actually passing through higgs field and there are little higgs particles that accumulate on the moving particle which is where mass and momentum come from but thats where my main question comes from this all sounds similar to medium and mediums usually impart resistance on particles moving through them so the particles would slow down even in space as far as know this is the reason why aether ether theories dont work please let me know
24263 if you go to any course about photography you learn that all colors are made up of the colors red green and blue rgb if you mix red green and blue light you will get white light or any other color according to how much of each light color you use if you ask physicist he or she will tell you that the visible light is made up of all the colors in the rainbow the water splits the white light and shows the rainbow with all the different colors it contains what is color and what is it made of are all the colors in the rainbow really basic colors and photographers have just experienced that you can reproduce all those colors with red green and blue what is the commonly accepted idea about colors
24280 there are multiple theories about time traveling one is proven the time slows down according to your speed the satellites in space are traveling faster than us thus their clocks slows down bit so by traveling at the speed of light you would travel without the time so the time stops when you are traveling with the speed of light then you would travel forwards in time because when you slow down the time around you will have gone in the regular speed while being still in your time another completely inverse theory by einstein is that extra dimension the space time so if you make wormhole you would be able to travel past the bends in the space time thus traveling faster than the light if you arrive before the light then you would have traveled back in time also want to point out that some physicists have managed to send messages back in time with the help of photons even though we are only talking about microseconds just saw an interview on discovery channel which of these or both is generally believed to be true if any and what about the paradoxes do you know any paradoxes regarding this maybe you are able to solve them one ive found is that if you travel into the future and grab product that you start selling in the presence the product will be in the future because you got it while time traveling who did make the product in the first place im mostly interested in the paradoxes created while time traveling

24312 would like to understand how physicists think of space time in the context of string theory understand that there are large space dimensions time dimension and or or extra dimensions and all these dimensions need to fit together in way such that the extra dimensions are compactified with calabi yau or structure my question however is not about the possible or dimensional manifolds that may be possible but about whether string theorists consider space time as somehow quantized or discrete or rather as continuous manifold or are both options possible in other words can strings move continuously through space or are there discrete set of locations where strings can be and does string theory rule out one of the options how about the same question in loop quantum gravity lqg should think of the spin networks in lqg as describing discrete space time thanks for your insight or any references you may be able to provide
24314 why is gravity stronger than other forces at the macroscopic level yet weaker than other forces at the quantum level is there an explanation
24367 im presuming that the scientific community pretty much agrees that randomness doesnt exits and that everything has cause please correct me if im wrong ive heard of quantum mechanics but as far as know it only says that it is impossible to know the electrons position and speed in the same time because of the uncertainty principle but dont think that this makes the electron move randomly now lets consider big bang point starts expanding in size as the time flows if there isnt any randomness it is logical to conclude that matter will position itself in some kind of predictable pattern not chaotic shapes as we see today so ask you how did the universe form as it is today is that proof that randomness truly does exits does randomness break laws of logic and physics

24923 suppose there are two charged black holes which collide to form bigger black hole but when they combine lot of potential energy of the system is lost gained depending on their charges the opposite or the same will it manifest as an increase decrease in mass of the big black hole if the mass were to come down ve ve collision will the resultant black hole shrink in size
24934 if large star goes supernova but not enough mass collapses to form black hole it often forms neutron star my understanding is that this is the densest object that can exist because of the pauli exclusion principle its made entirely of degenerate matter each particle of which cannot occupy the same quantum state of any other so these objects are so massive that they gravitationally lens light if you make them more massive they bend the light more keep going and going until they bend the light so much that light passing near the surface can barely escape its still neutron star add bit more mass just enough that light passing just over the surface cannot escape now its black hole with an event horizon think does this mean the neutron star has become singularity isnt it still just neutron star just beneath the event horizon why are black holes treated as having singularity instead of just an incredibly massive neutron star at its center does something happen when an event horizon is created
25038 there are numerous pictures obviously of the blackness of space from the shuttle the space station and even the moon but they all suffer from being from the perspective of camera which is not sensitive enough to pick up the stars in the background when compared to the bright foreground objects the limb of the earth the station moon etc ive seen some photos that show few of the brightest stars but nothing special are there any photos or eye witness accounts from astronauts of what it looks like to human with night adjusted vision if were in an orbit similar to the space station and looked away from the earth would be able to see more stars than ever could on earth or would it only be marginally better than the best terrestrial night viewing
25070 understand that we can never see much farther than the farthest galaxies we have observed this is because before the first galaxies formed the universe was opaque it was soup of subatomic particles that scattered all light but before the universe was opaque the big bang happened which is where the cosmic microwave background cmb comes from if the opaque early universe scattered all light and the first few galaxies are as far back as we can see why is the cmb observable where is it coming from
25076 we know that the age of the universe or at least the time since the big bang is roughly billion years have heard that the size of the universe is much larger than what we can see in other words much larger than the observable universe is this true why would this not conflict with what is given by special relativity namely that faster than light travel is prohibited if it is true then what is the estimated size of the universe and how can we know

25369 understand that the event horizon of black hole forms at the radius from the singularity where the escape velocity is but its also true that you dont have to go escape velocity to escape an object if you can maintain some kind of thrust you could escape the earth at km if you could maintain the proper amount of thrust for enough time so if you pass just beneath the event horizon shouldnt you be able to thrust your way back out despite the escape velocity or does this restriction have to do solely with relativistic effects time stopping for outside observers at the event horizon

25451 remember from watching cosmos years ago carl sagan suggested an interesting hypothetical method for directly seeing exoplanets he proposed that in the future we could launch satellite designed to block the light from distant stars effectively eclipsing them perhaps by unfolding large circular parasol allowing powerful telescope to directly detect the light from nearby orbiting planets based on this notion have two questions has or is this idea being seriously considered would it be possible to position space based telescope to take advantage of objects that are already in space to eclipse light from star perhaps moon or asteroid related lack of exoplanet missions in the decadal survey and given photo of the moon taken from earth is it possible to calculate the position of the photographers site

25591 if the big bang was the birth of everything and the big bang was an event in the sense that it had location and time time wouldnt that mean that our universe has center where was the big bang what is there now are we moving away from the center still are these even valid questions
25657 the photon sphere is spherical region in space where photons are forced to travel in an orbit at frac 3gm is it possible to detect these spheres what happens if fall through it what happens to photon that tangentially hits the event horizon wouldnt this also lead to photon orbiting the black hole edit since neutron stars also might have photon sphere do we know neutron stars that should have such sphere
25685 globular clusters like omega centauri certainly dont seem to be very coplanar at all in other words why doesnt the explanation at why are our planets in the solar system all on the same disc plane layer quoted below apply here we havent ironed out all the details about how planets form but they almost certainly form from disk of material around young star because the disk lies in single plane the planets are broadly in that plane too but im just deferring the question why should disk form around young star while the star is forming theres lot of gas and dust falling onto it this material has angular momentum so it swirls around the central object the star and the flow collides with itself the collisions cancel out the angular momentum in what becomes the vertical direction and smear the material out in the horizontal direction leading to disk eventually this disk fragments and forms planets like said the details arent well understood but were pretty sure about the disk part and thats why the planets are co planar
25698 blackholes may be really strong but they act in very short range for example if the sun was black having the same mass it will be dark but we will still be revolving around it it wont engulf us also hear that the outer stars in galaxy rotates around the galaxy with same speed as the inside stars this defies the law of gravity is this still mystery does anybody know what is the pull on star by galaxy and is this pull uniform throughout the galaxy related question is there evidence of dark matter in our galaxy
25708 the universes densest objects are black holes in the second place there are neutron stars so if neutron star compresses to its schwarzschild radius would it appear as black hole that black hole would be one of the most dense objects in the universe
25759 how exactly does time slow down near black hole have heard this as possible way of time traveling and do understand that it is due in some way to the massive gravity around black hole but how exactly does that massive gravity slow down time
25779 ive always wondered that since the earth is moving at very fast velocity around the sun why is it that when astronauts leave the earth the earth doesnt immediately move away from them at extremely large speeds
25796 know only that the vlt is equipped with adaptive optics ao to bypass atmospheric distortion is it the only one or have other telescopes been build with ao in the optical and infrared spectrum
25806 we all know that our universe is inflating from what is known as the big bang however will our universe continue to inflate at the current rate or after reaching maximum size will it collapse in big crunch
25883 possible duplicate why can we see the cosmic microwave background cmb we all have seen evidence of radiation left from the big bang but how is it still detectable why didnt it disperse early on
25924 forgive the elementary nature of this question because new moon occurs when the moon is positioned between the earth and sun doesnt this also mean that somewhere on the earth solar eclipse or partial eclipse is happening what then is the difference between solar eclipse and new moon
25968 given photo of the moon taken from earth is it possible to calculate the position earth longitude and latitude of the photographers site am thinking about photos taken with normal camera lens and not with telescope for example photos taken with mm lens like these one http www flickr com search moon cc ct mt all adv assume the photo shows enough detailed features like recognizable craters and maria is there any software capable of solving the problem thank you alessandro addendum diagram of simplified model of the problem is the radius of the earth is the average distance from the center of the moon to the center of the earth is the photographer site on the surface of the earth
25978 let us pretend for moment that there are two identical planets that are exactly opposite their star from each other and are the same distance from said star this would make them at all times double the distance from their star apart from each other would they under the definition of planet be considered planets one could argue they have not cleared their neighborhood by virtue of one not having cleared the other but it would seem strange to assume planet would be capable of clearing something that always has its sun in the way
25982 assuming for second that there were pocket of anti matter somewhere sufficiently large to form all the type of object we can see forming from normal matter then one of these objects would be black hole question is would there be difference between an anti matter black hole and normal matter black hole in terms of how would the matter anti matter make the black hole different or would they be the same would expect the answer to be that the black hole formed from anti matter would retain the anti matter properties in such way that if it was to merge with black hole at same size formed from normal matter that they would annihilate each other con convert into pure energy would that be correct understanding
26007 or in other words are there differences in average lyapunov timescale between orbits interior to jupiter and orbits exterior to jupiter im trying to answer question at http www quora com why does pluto have so many satellites answer alex chen but im not totally sure if the last part of my answer is right ill quote the last part of it if the 2nd theory is true then its harder to answer this one thing for sure though jupiter is much farther away so its tug on the system is much smaller factor than it is for the inner planets where it can be major source of instability over the solar systems lifetime in fact suspect that another factor is that from plutos perspective jupiter is practically in the center of the solar system anyways so youre unlikely to see periods of time where jupiter is in such position where its constant gravitational tugs over several jupiter orbits can accumulate and tug satellite into an unstable orbit which is what can happen with planets that orbit the sun at distances interior to jupiter anyways dont fully know the physics on this yet so some of my details could be wrong what do know is that it could happen to both asteroid belt objects and to mercurys orbit http en wikipedia org wiki stability of the solar system mercury e2 93jupiter resonance perhaps because there are positions where jupiters pull on interior bodies is in direction opposite to that of the suns pull we never hear about the sun creating any orbital instabilities and mercury is much closer to jupiter than pluto is of course pluto is vulnerable to neptunes influence but pluto and neptune have orbital resonance so its relatively safe from collisions with neptune although the resonance may not be constant over the solar systems lifetime anyways we might finally know more once new horizons reaches pluto in few years http www alpheratz net murison papers lyapunov lfm pdf says that there is something special about asteroids with orbits interior to jupiter ill try to find more information on this
26061 jay wacker1 professor of physics at the slac national accelerator laboratory stated the first stars known as pop iii were made out of hydrogen and helium they had no planets why couldnt they have had gas planets requires login at linkedin
26139 im curious about why the asteroid belt wasnt pulled by marss or jupiters gravity or formed into either moons or planets why did it form into an asteroid belt instead
26153 in this example of neutrino jet it seems that the supermassive black hole moves around the space and meets up with interstellar object sometimes source of the above image and larger version what force gives supermassive black hole the ability to move around the space
26177 as far as know astronomy is generally an observational science we see something and then try to explain why it is happening the one exception that know of is black holes first it was thought of then it was found einsteins relativity is middle ground to me he thought of light beams at the speed of light but obviously could observe gravitys effects anyway guess my question is what are the biggest discoveries that were thought of before they were seen in the sky
26182 have bunch of jpeg jpeg2000 gif and png files that in theory could be used for some types of science analysis if there were temporal and spatial information in them years ago had looked into trying to put some of the information as exif into the files and could enter timing information datetimeoriginal subsectimeoriginal exposuretime and even location of the main object of interest subjectarea but it had some issues with distance to the object subjectdistance as it stored it as rational number long long in meters and so the farthest distance could specify was about au is anyone else aware of people embedding scientific metadata in common use graphical formats and if so can you point me towards the specification project or implementation and other than geotiff or the like we just dont use tiff except for sending to museums im interested in trying to put the critical metadata into the browse images that were generating for the scientists
26257 know that the cosmic microwave background radiation cmbr is the leftover radiation from the surface of last scattering however at every instant the surface is changing at the rate of flow of time so how constant is the cmbr
26271 how can population iii star have mass of several hundred solar masses normally the limit is about solar masses
26274 heard this story where they celebrated the birthday of the now defunct north korean dictator kim il sung in the 1970s and as birthday present they created through some very complex artillery maneuvers an artificial total solar eclipse over pyongyang at that very moment the dictator stepped out of his palace in front of the crowd in suit covered with reflecting material and had giant reflectors directed at him so he practically outshone the sun while this seems plausible in view of the megalomania and extreme personality cult we all know about still wonder whether that is technically feasible im not looking for an answer whether the story is true or not so my question is whether there is any possibility to have an artificial man made total solar eclipse and if so how
26317 every now and then notice some very bright stars in the sky they tend to be very few one or two usually and are quite much brighter than any other star out there often theyre perfectly visible and bright even in dusk when no other star is visible yet or will be for some time to come now im writing the word star in quotes because really dont think that theyre stars but what are they planets satellites latest chuck norris encounters leaving the atmosphere my best guess would be that they are satellites because planets should be about the same brightness as stars but that sounds pretty implausible as well and yes im very certain that they are not airplanes

26372 black holes were first predicted by astrophysics then observed was the existence of galaxies first predicted by astrophysics or first observed by astronomers
26408 frequently hear that kepler using his equations of orbital motion could predict the orbits of all the planets to high degree of accuracy except mercury ive heard that mercurys motion couldnt be properly predicted until general relativity came around but what does general relativity have to do with mercurys orbit
26451 this is question in the area of extraterrestrial life while life may be possible without it space travel is probably impossible without metal metal is created in stars and heavy metals above iron are created in super novae in german posting someone mentioned that there are only very few stars outside of the galactic core which contain lot of metal there is little hope for life in the core itself but if metal is so rare outside the core that surely limits the options for aliens to build civilizations my question we can easily measure the amount of metal in star by looking at its spectrum does that give good indication of the metal distribution of dark bodies is there theory about the relation between elements in the star and its planets also read somewhere that there seem to be lot of free planets which dont orbit sun does this also apply to them
26454 in my mind im comparing it to the sun earth moon system after all the earth is primarily satellite of the sun but the moon is still gravitationally bound to the earth could something like this occur on smaller scale and are there any examples
26499 the question follows from xkcd cartoon depth perception ive isolated the frames that describe the concept here in words one could theoretically point two cameras at the sky and displace them so that if viewed as components of projected 3d image the starfield of the night sky would have perceivable depth that is sirius or alpha centauri would appear closer than say betelgeuse the idea sounds interesting but was wondering whether its actually possible that is how large would the displacement of the cameras need to be to create perceivable depth to quantify lets say were trying to reduce the scale from light years to would this require displacement of light years times separation of eyes approx1 light years approx136 au or is it more complicated than that guess the maximum we could achieve is by taking two images of the same field of stars one year apart and combining them to give separation of the eyes of about au dont know enough astrometry myself to be sure
26507 was reading this question and got to thinking can neutrino detectors give us any clue where the neutrinos came from or when supernova may occur
26515 how do scientists calculate that density what data do they have to calculate that
26574 just watched this spacerip video on youtube which shows pictures taken by hubble while looking into the disk of the andromeda galaxy to study certain type of variable star it occurred to me that if we can study individual stars in andromeda we must be able to use most of our methods of exoplanet detection on them is this true if so why not look for exoplanets in another galaxy my logic tells me that since its difficult to look through the disk of our own galaxy since were inside it were limited to relatively local region for detecting exoplanets but if we turned our sights to andromeda couldnt we study the differences in planet formation between different regions of galaxy also suspect that the reason were not doing this is because we would need much more sensitive instruments for this and because we already have one planet finding telescope in space so itd be tough to justify sending up another one am mostly right in this reasoning are we capable of searching for exoplanets in andromeda would there be benefit to doing it besides the obvious cool factor is cost pretty much the only limiting factor
26605 my understanding is that hawking radiation isnt really radiated from black hole but rather occurs when particle anti particle pair spontaneously pop into existence and before they can annihilate each other the antiparticle gets sucked into the black hole while the particle escapes in this way it appears that matter has escaped the black hole because it has lost some mass and that amount of mass is now zipping away from it is this correct if so wouldnt it be equally likely that the particle be trapped in the black hole and the antiparticle go zipping away appearing as if the black hole is spontaneously growing and emitting antimatter how is it that this process can become unbalanced and cause black hole to eventually emerge from its event horizon and evaporate into cosmic soup over eons
26636 could jupiters gravity destabilize earths artificial satellites over long timescale after all it can destabilize mercurys orbit and it can also destabilize orbits in the asteroid belt
26674 using ground based telescopes or the hubble space telescope astronomers take photographs of galaxies which are many light years from the earth does it mean those photographs are as old as the galaxies are far from the earth as read that the universe is growing very radidly then its position and shape should have changed after many years are photographs useless as result
26692 this question is actually related to my earlier question what is motion the fact that objects move lot in the universe and that the universe is expanding can imply that gravity is repulsive force that increases with distance so the farthest objects repel us more this can still explain several existing observations why does the apple fall motion is the result of such repulsion two objects unlucky enough not to be moving relative to each other get squished due to the repulsion of the rest of the universe around them the earth repels the apple less than the stars so it is pushed towards the earth furthermore it can explain the expanding universe without the need for dark energy this could be demonstrated in thought experiment if we take lot of same charge particles with small mass such as electrons and lock them in large box at low enough temperature the mutual repulsion of the particles may cause similar motion as if due to gravitational attraction another experiment would be to measure the slight changes in our weight during day and night when the sun and earth align if their masses are large enough to detect the feeble change in repulsion edit the question in the original form may not have been clear it is can we model with yes no answer and why not if downvoting please justify
26720 is there any scientific evidence that demonstrates why time passes or is it just an opened question
26739 vertical takeoff requires disposable rockets would it satellite rocket which is money loss and also lot of fuel because initial velocity is zero also vertical takeoff seems risky involves huge pieces of equipments launch pads to diminish risk horizontal takeoff are done with reusable aircraft like modified initial velocity not being zero there are much less risk and the fuel spent in is much less expensive than disposable rocket so why are there more vertical takeoff than horizontal for spacecrafts
26742 whenever did calculations in high school physics involving gravity it was either ball falling to the earth type scenario or basic measurement of the gravitational attraction between two planetoids think read somewhere recently that gravitational changes arent reflected instantly across the universe but instead propagate at the speed of light somewhat like the ripples in pond expanding is this true is there experimental evidence to confirm or deny this what is the theoretical basis for it
26748 was reading thread about how pendulum would be affected if the earth did not rotate and larians answer made me wonder if all planets rotate necessarily due to physics so thats the question is it possible for there to exist planet that doesnt rotate at all and why in any solar system or galaxy
26764 in photographs of jupiter the limb seems extremely definite being gas giant my naive self thinks that the atmosphere should have more gradual cut off creating hazy effect similar to that on titan am aware of jupiters immense size so each pixel in the linked photograph is likely tens or hundreds of kilometers even so wouldnt there be some small smudge does perhaps jupiters terrific gravity have any effect on the apparent edge of its atmosphere
26780 since of matter is what we cannot see why cant it be black holes from early on is is possible to figure out that there are no black holes in the line of sight of various stars galaxies we observe
26798 was attempting to do some calculations of apparent magnitude to help solidify my understanding of the topic but have been running into some confusion according to wikipedia the apparent magnitude can be given as log where is the observed flux and is reference flux in other words this equation provides the difference of apparent magnitude between two observed values also this is assuming that the same wavelength band is used in both flux measurements flux in turn can be calculated as frac where is the stars luminosity and is the flux density since stars act as point sources this can be simplified to frac pi where is the distance to the star since historically vega has been used as the reference zero point having an apparent magnitude around tried doing simple calculation to find out the apparent magnitude of fomalhaut using the values for luminosity and distance given in wikipedia for both of them first the flux of vega vega frac odot pi ly vega times odot ly next the flux of fomalhaut fomalhaut frac odot pi ly fomalhaut times odot ly now to calculate the apparent magnitude fomalhaut log frac times odot ly times odot ly fomalhaut huh fomalhauts apparent magnitude is supposed to be even correcting for vegas offset of we still come up with why are the calculations failing dont think ive made mistake in the mathematics am using the wrong values
26906 guess by now most people have heard about the new paper arxiv by the opera collaboration which claims to have observed superluminal neutrinos with sigma significance obviously this has been greeted with great deal of skepticism and there will no doubt be debate over systematic errors for long time to come and frankly expect some unaccounted for systematic error to be the case here obviously theorists abhor superluminal travel and am well aware of many of the reasons for this however the paper has me wondering whether there have been any toy models put forward which would be both consistent with the opera paper and with earlier bounds on neutrino velocity in particular if taken with other previous papers from minos and from observations of the supernova you have the following bounds on neutrino velocity in various average energy regimes gev frac times gev frac pm stat pm sys times gev frac pm times mev frac times is there any proposed model which is actually consistent with such results it seems that there has been lot of pointing to the supernova bound the 10mev scale as being inconsistent with the reported findings however if there was mechanism whereby the velocity were monotonic function of energy or depended on flavor this argument would be negated do there exist any such proposed mechanisms
26983 many years ago when css codes were first invented the error threshold of was found when bit and phase flips are independent has threshold yet been found for the case of depolarizing noise
27048 it seems me that there is difference at least apparently in how the belinfante rosenfeld tensor is thought of in section of volume of weinbergs qft book and in section of the conformal field theory book by di francesco et al would be glad if someone can help reconcile the issue schematically the main issue as see is this if the action and the lagrangian density is writable as int 4x and omega mu nu be the small parameter of lorentz transformation then weinberg is thinking of omega mu nu to be space time independent and he is varying the action to write it in the form delta int 4x delta mu nu omega mu nu then some symmetrized form of whatever this mu nu comes out to be is what is being called the belinfante tensor its conservation needs the fields to satisfy the equations of motion but following francesco et als set up am inclined to think of omega mu nu as being space time dependent and then the variation of the action will also pick up terms from the jacobian and the calculation roughly goes as saying delta int deltad 4x int 4x delta since under rigid lorentz transformations the volume element is invariant the coefficient of omega mu nu in the first variation will vanish but the second variation will produce coefficient say mu nu but both the variations will produce coefficient for the derivative of omega mu nu and let them be mu nu lambda and mu nu lambda respectively now the argument will be that since the original action was to start off invariant under lorentz transformations when evaluated about them the mu nu should be and on shifting partial derivatives the sum of mu nu lambda and mu nu lambda is the conserved current and its not clear whether their conservation needs the field to satisfy the equation of motion so by the first way mu nu will be the conserved current and in the second the conserved current will be mu nu lambda mu nu lambda the tensor will basically look like nu eta lambda mu is the above argument correct if yes then are the two arguments equivalent how or is weinbergs argument taking into account the contribution to the conserved current from the variation of the jacobian of the transformation
27096 came across this abstract and am curious as to what the atlas team has actually discovered abstract motivated by the result of the higgs boson candidates at lep with mass of about gev c2 the observation given in atlas note atl com phys november and the publication production of isolated higgs particle at the large hadron collider physics letters we studied the invariant mass distribution over the range of to gev c2 with pb data from and pb from we observe resonance around gev c2 with significance of the event rate for this resonance is about thirty times larger than the expectation from higgs to in the standard model this channel is of great importance because the presence of new heavy particles can enhance strongly both the higgs production cross section and the decay branching ratio this large enhancement over the standard model rate implies that the present result is the first definitive observation of physics beyond the standard model exciting new physics including new particles may be expected to be found in the very near future the abstract seems to be from restricted web site cern log in required however have been able to track down pdf that seems to be discussing the same phenomenon however the abstracts are not the same currently as understand it there is lot of skepticism about the initial higgs candidate if this isnt the higgs then what part of the standard model is actually being represented or is this an entirely new phenomenon
27138 in evaluating the vacuum structure of quantum field theories you need to find the minima of the effective potential including perturbative and nonperturbative corrections where possible in supersymmetric theories you often see the claim that the hler potential is the suitable quantity of interest as the superpotential does not receive quantum corrections for simplicity lets consider just the case of single chiral superfield phix theta phix theta alpha psi alphax theta fx and its complex conjugate the low energy action functional that includes the hler and superpotential is bar phi phi int mathrm 8z bar phi phi int mathrm 6z phi int mathrm bar bar bar phi keeping only the scalar fields and no spacetime derivatives the components are begin align bar phi phi big text eff pot int mathrm 4x big bar frac partial 2k bar phi phi partial phi partial bar phi phi bar phi big xrightarrow to phi int mathrm 4x big frac partial 2k bar phi phi partial phi partial bar phi big phi int mathrm 4x bar phi phi end align where in the second line we solve the simple equations of motion for the auxiliary field the vacua are then the minuma of the effective potential bar phi phi however if you read the old up to mid 80s literature on supersymmetry they calculate the effective potential using all of the scalars in the theory the coleman weinberg type effective potential using the background external fields phix theta phix theta fx this leads to an effective potential bar phi phi bar which is more than quadratic in the auxiliary fields so clearly not equivalent to calculating just the hler potential the equivalent superfield object is the hler potential auxiliary fields potential as defined in supersymmetric effective potential superfield approach or here it can be written as bar phi phi int mathrm 8z bigk bar phi phi bar phi phid phi bar bar phi big int mathrm 6z phi int mathrm bar bar bar phi where bar phi phid phi bar bar phi is at least cubic in phi bar bar phi the projection to low energy scalar components of the above gives the effective potential bar phi phi bar that is in general non polynomial in the auxiliary fields and so clearly harder to calculate and work with than the quadratic result given above so my question is when did this shift to calculating only the hler potential happen and is there good reason you can ignore the corrections of higher order in the auxiliary fields
27176 using form of the haag kastler axioms for quantum field theory see aqft on the nlab for more details it is possible in quite general contexts to prove that all local algebras are isomorphic to the hyperfinite iii factor or to the tensor product of the iii factor with the center of the given local algebra local algebra is the algebra of observables that is associated to an open bounded subset of minkowski space the term iii factor refers to the murray von neumann classification of factors of von neumann algebras also see this question on math overflow for more details so one could say that quantum mechanics has the and infty factors as playground while qft has the hyperfinite iii factor as playground my questions has two parts would like to know about concrete physical system where it is possible to show that the local algebras are hyperfinite iii factors if there is one where this is possible is there an interpretation in physical terms of the presence of the hyperfinite iii factor in qft
27179 one perspective is to say that one introduced the ghost fields into the lagrangian to be able to write the gauge transformation determinant as path integral hence was tempted to think of them as just some auxiliary variables introduced into the theory to make things manageable but then one observes that having introduced them there is now an extra global u1 symmetry the ghost number hence hasnt one now basically added new factor of u1 to the symmetry group of the theory how can the symmetry of the theory depend on introduction of some auxiliary fields now if one takes the point of view that the global symmetry has been enhanced then the particles should also lie in the irreducible representations of this new factor hence ghost number should be like new quantum number for the particles and which has to be conserved but one sees that ghost field excitations are brst exact and hence unphysical since they are in the brst cohomology am unable to conceptually reconcile the above three ideas the first two seem to tell me that the ghost number is very physical thing but the last one seems to tell me that it is unphysical at the risk of sounding more naive if the particles are now charged under the ghost number symmetry then shouldnt one be able to measure that in the laboratory lastly this ghost number symmetry is global rigid u1 symmetry cant there be case where it is local and needs to be gauged
27195 take the poincar group for example the conservation of rest mass is generated by the invariance with respect to partial mu partial mu now if one simply claims the state where the expectation value of symmetry generator equals the conserved quantity must be stationary one obtains begin array rl stackrel delta langle psi psi rangle rightarrow stackrel square psix end array that is the klein gordon equation now wonder is this generally possible quantization does this yield the dirac equation for frac12 when applied to the pauli lubanski pseudo vector mu frac epsilon mu nu rho sigma nu rho sigma squared which has the expectation value ss
27268 what are the known methods for visualizing quantum states of one dimensional spin chains they can be based either on their wave functions or density matrices my particular interest is in plotting eigenstates of 1d spin chains heisenberg model in way in which correlations between particles are related to the self similarity of the image as side note found wikipedia commons image with its description on the topic thumbnail below however it is not supported neither by peer reviewed publication nor by decent preprint the only text related is extremely drafty however im the most interested in published results and even more when they relate properties of the image to the properties of the state
27332 adm mass is useful measure of system it is often defined wald adm frac pi lim to infty oint mu nu mu mu mu nu nu da where is two sphere with radius going to infinity however have also seen the following definition edit for example page of relativists toolkit adm frac pi lim to infty oint sqrt sigma theta where is the extrinsic curvature of embedded in flat space and is the extrinsic curvature of embedded on hypersurface of the spacetime it is not overly clear to me how these two are related obvious we can get the same differential with the follow definition da sqrt sigma theta but more so than that it doesnt seem clear why those extrinsic curvatures should be equal to those metric derivatives times the constant term of presumably the fact that we are taking the limit out to to infty is important as we are assuming that the metric should be asymptotically flat or at least asymptotically constant metric and these quantities might be reduced to some similar form in the limit any insight

27402 this question was listed as one of the questions in the proposal see here and didnt know the answer dont know the ethics on blatantly stealing such question so if it should be deleted or be changed to cw then ill let the mods change it most foundations of statistical mechanics appeal to the ergodic hypothesis however this is fairly strong assumption from mathematical perspective there are number of results frequently used in statistical mechanics that are based on ergodic theory in every statistical mechanics class ive taken and nearly every book ive read the assumption was made based solely on the justification that without it calculations become virtually impossible hence was surprised to see that it is claimed in the first link that the ergodic hypothesis is absolutely unnecessary the question is fairly self explanatory but for full answer id be looking for reference containing development of statistical mechanics without appealing to the ergodic hypothesis and in particular some discussion about what assuming the ergodic hypothesis does give you over other foundational schemes
27473 am looking for references on how to obtain continuum theories from lattice theories there are basically few questions that am interested in but any references are welcome for example you can obtain the ising chiral cft from lattice theory how does this work exactly intuitively is is clear that one should do something like taking the lattice spacing to zero is this worked out somewhere in detail for this example one can also image say quantum spin models with sites on the edges of some graph such that the interactions do not depend on the distance between the sites one can imagine subdividing this graph further to obtain an inclusion of the associated algebras of observables this leads to an increasing sequence of algebras and one can take the direct limit of this can one in this way obtain continuum theory suppose that one might have to impose some conditions on the dynamics of the system at each step is something like this done in the literature im mainly interested in mathematical treatment of these topics
27479 in their book condensed matter field theory altland and simons often use the following formula for calculating thermal expectation values of exponentials of real field theta langle thetax tau theta00 rangle frac12 langle thetax tau theta00 rangle an example can be found in chapter problem boson fermion duality part this refers to the second edition of the book page in other words expectation values of exponentials can be cast as exponentials of expectation values under certain conditions unfortunately seem to be unable to find an explanation of why this can be done and what the conditions on the lagrangian of theta are hence my question is how to derive the above formula what do we need to know about theta for it to be valid in the first place ideally am looking for derivation using the path integral formalism managed to rederive very special case in terms of operators and the baker campbell hausdorff formula but id like to gain more thorough understanding
27520 as grad student have single publication conference proceeding to my name so my question is what do need to do to obtain post doc position obviously my references are going to be important but what other methods are available to me to demonstrate my competence as am us based is it worth my time to apply for an nrc fellowship
27643 for countable sequence of positive numbers lambda in is there construction producing hamiltonian with spectrum or at least having the same eigenvalues for leq for some here by hamiltonian understand polynomial of and or equivalently and dagger of pairs of variables and of order 2n both and can be functions of and for example for the spectrum ldots one of hamiltonians working for any is dagger
27681 there are two pure symmetric states psi rangle and phi rangle of qudits is there any known set of invariants in ldotsk which is equal for both states iff phi rangle otimes psi rangle for in text su there is theorem by hilbert saying that for compact group acting on linear space there is finite number of polynomial invariants characterizing orbits however as far as know it does not provide and explicit construction of the invariants the problem is easy when schmidt decomposition and majorana representation partial solutions and solutions with changed assumptions linear operators instead of unitary operations are welcome as well

27773 im studying the edge theory of the fractional quantum hall effect fqhe and ive stumbled on peculiar contradiction concerning the bosonization procedure which am unable to resolve help in particular consider the first few pages of wens paper theory of the edge states in fractional quantum hall effects here wen defines fermionic field psixt in dimensions in terms of bosonic field phixt as psixt propto frac nu phixt the number nu is the filling fraction of the fqhe which we shall set to nu for simplicity the bosonic field fulfills the somewhat strange commutation relations phixy phiyt pi nu text sgn which are necessary to make psixt anticommute like proper fermion lbrace psixt psi daggeryt rbrace deltax moreover the bosonic field satisfies the equation of motion partial partial phixt some operator algebra shows that psixt is also solution to this equation of motion however it appears to me that these two requirements anticommutation and the equation of motion already fix the greens function of the fermion however wen goes on to note that these fermions have the greens function equation in the paper gxt langle psi daggerxt psi0 rangle exp langle frac1 nu phixt phi0 rangle propto frac vt nu do not understand how this can be after all from the anticommutation relations and the equation of motion we can calculate the greens function to be gxt propto frac vt to do this define fourier modes psi psi dagger obtain the usual anticommutation relations for these solve the equation of motion and transform back into real space the result will be as noted and the exponent nu will be missing where did the exponent nu go whats wrong with calculating the greens function from the anticommutation relations and the equation of motion maybe theres something going on inside the deltax part of the anticommutation relations if so what exactly or maybe something about the ground state or something about the bosonization procedure as whole
27794 from what ive read according to relativity photon does not experience the passage of time can we say there is no past present future for photon would it be better to say photon is fixed in spacetime if so how do we explain the apparent movement of photon is everything else moving relative to it in spacetime
27830 its told in landau classical mechanics that in the hamiltonian method generalized coordinates and generalized momenta are independent variables of mechanical system anyway in the case of lagrangian method only generalized coordinates are independent in this case generalized velocities are not independent as they are the derivatives of coordinates so as understood in the first method there are twice more independent variables than in the second this fact is used during the variation of action and finding the equations of motion my question is can the number of independent variables of the same system be different in these cases besides that how can the momenta be independent from coordinates if we have this equation frac partial partial dot
27837 what are the major differences between physics and chemistry know that they both study atoms electrons and molecules but what makes some topics part of one and some part of another
27847 for elastic collisions of particles we know that momentum in the three orthogonal directions are independently conserved frac dt sum limits iv ij quad from this it follows theres also corresponding scalar quantity conserved frac dt sum limits iv i1 i2 i3 frac dt sum limits iv quad so why is there need to put in front of this conserved scalar quantity kinetic energy
27849 am having trouble understanding how eq in this paper pdf mathcal mathcal propto langle phiu0 tilde phi v0 rangle mathcal mathbb generalizes to eqn langle mathcal xy mbox sheet rangle mathcal mathcal frac langle phiu0 tilde phi v0 mathcal xy rangle mathcal mathbb langle phiu0 tilde phi v0 rangle mathcal mathbb its quite possible that some of you with more experience in cfts will be able to immediately answer this for me without the context but here it is anyway we want to evaluate the partition function on the riemann manifold mathcal which consists of flat 2d sheets joined together at the branch cut between and in the manner shown in fig in the paper we do this by modeling the manifold as disconnected flat sheets with twist fields inserted at the branch points it turns out that the original partition function is proportional to the correlation function of two twist fields as in eq later on the paper makes use of the correlation function with insertions of the stress energy tensor so that generalization with the equality sign is crucial your help is appreciated in particular how does this not mean that the partition function in eq is not actually proportional to the two point function but is simply equal to one am replacing the mathcal in with one to make this claim
27866 so know this is pretty fundamental question but ill ask it any way lets say you have 12v battery and the positive is connected to the negative directly by wire with negligible resistance is the voltage drop between the positive terminal and the negative terminal still 12v without resistor know this is short circuit by the way
27909 by blowing at pencil piece of paper or another object up to fifty centimeters away can cause it to move away from me significantly but cant move an object toward myself by inhaling sharply from that distance even if it is extremely light why is that
27939 this is problem just started puzzling over and felt this would be good forum to check my reasoning so here are the relevant observations followed by my question water achieves its maximum density at roughly that is water including ice at all other temperatures below or above is less dense since matter is ordered from top to bottom by increasing density any water in lake will be found at the bottom temperature is continuous property and so the water in lake must be arranged by temperature as well that is there can be no regions of water with temperature and unless there is region between them with temperature so my initial puzzlement arose from trying to imagine the temperature arrangement of water with temperatures from to if water is the most dense it must be on the bottom of the lake and both the and the water must be above it however if temperature is continuous there must be water between any and water so there is no way for these three temperatures of water to coexist without violating either the ordering of densities or the continuous distribution of temperature suspect the coexistence of these temperatures in water is most likely possible but it is short lived imagine some kind of convection current where the water eventually reaches equilibrium at but the picture of this is pretty blurry to me so does it follow from this that for relatively warm lake temps from to begin to freeze all the water must reach before any sub temperature is reached otherwise there would be situation with water coexisting right edit heres an extension of this thought that begs for some testing since the ordering of densities occurs because of buoyant forces which occur in gravitational field wonder if the temperature profile of cooling freezing water is significantly different in anti gravity based on the above observations would expect the temperature barrier at not to be observed whoa
28093 is there any equation that states the relation between pressure and water flow lets say that in hour with 8mca water collum meters pressure obtain 50m3 what if giving the same contditions execute the same test but now with 15mca is that just proportional
28111 bit of background helps frame this question the question itself is in the last sentence for his phd thesis richard feynman and his thesis adviser john archibald wheeler devised an astonishingly strange approach to explaining electron electron interactions without using field their solution was to take the everyday retarded wave solution to maxwells equations and mix it with the advanced backwards in time solution that up until then had always been discarded as obviously violating temporal causality in series of papers they showed that this was not the case and that the recoil of an electron when it emits photon could self consistently be explained as the result of an advanced photon traveling backwards in time and impacting the electron at the same instant in which the electron emits forward in time photon while feynmans thesis ideas deeply influenced his subsequent development of qed in qeds backwards in time interpretation of antimatter electrons positrons feynman in letter to wheeler later famously retracted well famously for some of us the specific idea of paired photons traveling forwards and backwards in time feynmans specific reason for abandoning his thesis premise was vacuum polarization which cannot be explained by direct electron to electron interactions vacuum polarization is easily accommodated by qed however feynmans abandonment of the original feynman wheeler retarded advanced photon scheme has always troubled me the reason is this if their original idea was completely invalid the probability from an information correlation perspective of the idea leading to accurate predictions of how physics operates should have been vanishingly small instead their oddly arbitrary mix of real waves and hypothesized backwards in time waves almost works all the way down to the minute length scales at which vacuum polarization becomes significant one analogy is that the feynman wheeler scheme behaves like slightly broken mathematical symmetry one that correctly describes reality over almost the entire range of phenomena to which it applies but then breaks down at one of the extrema of its range my question finally is this does there exist clear conceptual explanation perhaps in the qed description of vacuum polarization for example of why the feynman wheeler retarded advanced model of paired photons traveling two directions in time provides an accurate model of reality overall despite its being incorrect when applied at very short distances addendum if ive understood ronmaimon correctly and certainly still do not fully understand the matrix part of his answer his central answer to my question is both simple and highly satisfying feynman did not abandon the backward forward scheme at all but instead abandoned the experimentally incorrect idea that an electron cannot interact with itself so his objection to wheeler could perhaps be paraphrased in more upbeat form into something more like this vacuum polarization shows that the electron does indeed interact with itself so was wrong about that but your whole backwards and forwards in time idea works very well indeed got nobel prize for it so thank for pointing me in that direction answer to ron and my thanks
28118 the theory ive recently come to postulates that the volume of space filling the universe is finite and is constantly growing thus the boundaries of the universe are constantly expanding the expansion of the universes boundaries is caused by light that is converted into fresh space while reaching the universes boundaries from within the expansion of the universes matter is caused not by kinetic reasons of big bang somewhere in distant past but instead by the tendency of the matter to distribute itself evenly across the ever increasing volume of space which is perhaps connected to the cosmological constant well is it worth any constructive discussion any existing theories if this kind or is it another example of why amateur physicists should not post their lunatic theories on this forum and like the second postulate best is there way for it to branch into separate theory if the combination of the three doesnt work out
28174 my understanding is that gravitomagnetism is essentially the same relativistic effect as magnetism if so why is it that ive heard so much about magnetic monopoles but never gravitomagnetic monopoles arent each just as theoretically well motivated as the other in similar vein one always hears that there is no independent existence of an electric or magnetic field only the electromagnetic field because and fields transform into each other under lorentz boosts shouldnt the same statement apply to gravity and gravitomagnetism
28312 highlighted the part where the confusion is the sentence said that the potential difference is yet it then immediately talks about how electrons can have motion what are they trying to say
28350 you know how birds perch on powerlines without getting electrocuted what if by some chance that find myself falling and grab on one of them lets say both of my hands are on the same line would get electrocuted am thinking wont because the current wont rush through me and wont be part of the circuit me powerline how does the ground play role in this ive heard people say that the ground creates potential difference but how there is only voltage across the powerlines the pole connecting to the ground is wood an insulator thanks
28407 if you take giant whale out of the water and put it on land for long enough it will crush itself under its own weight why doesnt the animal get crushed under its own weight when its in water
28488 professor asked me about the equation which used in paper or with ct told him that it was the exact equation of motion for relativistic particle undergoing constant acceleration he had some doubts about the equation so went back to my office and derived the equation over again but it was quite messy its such simple equation basically it says that to convert particle motion from newtonian to relativistic you have to replace parabolas with hyperbolas instead of speeding up indefinitely the particle speed approaches pm is there simple or short derivation
28505 this question is based on problem ii in anthony zees book quantum field theory in nutshell show by explicit calculation that is the lorentz vector see that the generators of su2 are the pauli matrices and the generators of so31is matrix composed of two pauli matrices along the diagonal is it always the case that the direct product of two groups is formed from the generators like this ask this because im trying to write lorentz boost as two simultaneous quatertion rotations unit quaternions rotations are isomorphic to su2 and tranform between the two methods is this possible in other words how do construct the su2 representation of the lorentz group using the fact that su2 times su2 sim so31 here is some background information zee has shown that the algebra of the lorentz group is formed from two separate su2 algebras so31 is isomorphic to su2 times su2 because the lorentz algebra satisfies begin align ie ijk ie ijk end align the representations of su2 are labeled by frac ldots so the su2 times su2 rep is labelled by with the being the lorentz vector because and each representation contains 2j elements so contains elements

28568 what is each mathematical step in detail that one would take to get from 2c 2c to gamma mc where gamma is the relativistic dilation factor this is for an object in motion note in the answer would like full explanation when explaining how to derive from frac rather than giving an answer of frac give one where you describe each step like times both sides both sides but of course still with the numbers on display youd be surprised at how people would assume not to describe in this detail
28573 ive been trying to grok general relativity for while now and ive been having some trouble many physics textbooks gloss over the subject with an its too advanced for this medium and many other resources start out with something like well space is just non euclidean manifold with ricci tensor defined as follows which would be cool if understood non euclidean manifolds or ricci tensors unfortunately when try to crack open wikipedia articles on non euclidean articles on the ricci tensor have trouble making sense of all the foreign terms is non euclidean geometry good place to start if want to understand general relativity whats good introductory resource for non euclidean geometry for someone whos only ever dealt with euclidean note understand the basic principles of general relativity how acceleration and gravity are different perspectives about the same thing and how clocks move slower when higher in gravity field but want to understand the math and how it was derived
28583 this question is follow up to what was missing in diracs argument to come up with the modern interpretation of the positron there still is some confusion in my mind about the so called negative energy solutions to the dirac equation solving the dirac equation one finds the spectrum of allowed energies includes both positive and negative solutions what does this negativity refer to given that the dirac equation is symmetric under charge conjugation the convention to call one positive and the other negative appears perfectly arbitrary would it be therefore correct to refer to the electrons as negative energy positrons in similar spirit physicists used to be worried about the negative energy solutions decaying into infinity through emission of photons by the same symmetry argument this should also be problem for photons it is not entirely clear to me how the quantization of the field supresses this issue is the photon emission for the negative state re interpreted as photon absorption by positron my understanding is that the whole discussion about positive or negative energy solutions is misleading what matters is the physical content through the qed interaction hamiltonian which does not predict this infinite descent is this correct edit think understand the source of my confusion after the comments if get it right the dirac sea picture is equivalent to the freedom of choice in the formally infinite vacuum energy one observes after quantization of the qed hamiltonian holes in the sea are positive energy positrons equivalent to the action of the positron creation operator on the vacuum is this correct
28656 have question which is inspired by considering the light field coming off an incandescent lightbulb as blackbody radiation field the light is in thermal equilibrium at temperature which implies that each normal mode has mean energy given by plancks law and random phase thus if were to look microscopically at the electric field would see fairly complicated random function that can only really be considered constant at timescales tau ll hbar at which the corresponding modes have next to no amplitude and therefore do not affect the electric fields time dependence this illustrates general aspect of thermal and thermodynamic equilibrium they are only relevant concepts when the systems involved are looked at on timescales far longer than their relevant dynamics my question then is this are examples of slowly varying systems where by slowly mean on the timescales of seconds or preferably longer that can be considered to be in thermal equilibrium on timescales longer than that known
28720 know that what planck length equals to the first question is how do you get the formula ell sqrt frac hbar that describes the planck length the second question is will any length shorter than the planck length be inaccessible if so what is the reason behind this
28747 the question is pretty clear think only started learning gr but the results ive seen so far and from some lectures saw from leonard susskind on youtube understood that for low energy densities the curvature of space time is mainly in the time coordinate is this true is the gravity we feel here on earth mainly the result of curvature of the time coordinate
28783 in my textbook it lists isotopes of carbon and it noted that is radioactive and are not is there direct relationship between the number of neutrons and an elements radioactivity in other words since we know is radioactive does that mean we also know that if such thing exists would also be radioactive
28816 thought of thought experiment that had me questioning how time reversal works in quantum mechanics and the implications the idea is this you are going forward in time when you decide to measure particle the particle then collapses to the observed state now if physics were to be the same in reverses time then if we stop and reverse time then measure that very same particle again then would imagine that since the wave function has collapsed we ought to measure the same thing what this says to me is that given some time evolution in the direction if we measure particle and it collapses the wave function then if you reverse the arrow of time to go in the direction we ought to get the same answer as before the future present effects the past this means if we theoretically had time machine and went back in time we would have traveled into different past another implication of this thought experiment is that the future would be indistinguishable from the past and would hence forth be the same would imagine that this is consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics since physics dictates that entropy only increases going in the reverse direction of time to decrease entropy would violate the laws of physics has anyone else out there thought about this from my studies in quantum mechanics dont remember any postulates stating anything like this but this all makes sense to me are there any theories out there that go along these lines
28895 realise the question of why this sky is blue is considered reasonably often here one way or another you can take that knowledge as given what im wondering is given that the spectrum of rayleigh scattering goes like omega why is the sky not purple rather than blue think this is reasonable question because we do see purple or strictly violet or indigo in rainbows so why not across the whole sky if thats the strongest part of the spectrum there are two possible lines of argument ive seen elsewhere and im not sure which if not both is correct firstly the suns thermal emission peaks in the visible range so we do actually receive less purple than blue secondly the receptors in our eye are balanced so that we are most sensitive to roughly the middle of the visible spectrum our eyes are simply less sensitive to the purple light than to the blue
28912 have this general wave equation begin equation dfrac partial psi partial dfrac partial psi partial dfrac dfrac partial psi partial end equation and the following transformation vt and the solution to this has to be dfrac partial psi partial left frac right dfrac partial psi partial dfrac 2v dfrac partial psi partial partial dfrac dfrac partial psi partial this proves that the velocity of the wave depends on the direction you are looking at dont know how to get to this if you just substitute it in the equation you get vt in the partial derivative is there another way to do this or which rule do have to use to solve it was thinking about the chain rule or something but how do apply it on partial derivatives
28931 this recent news article here is the original in german says that shouryya ray who moved to germany from india with his family at the age of has baffled scientists and mathematicians by solving two fundamental particle dynamics problems posed by sir isaac newton over years ago die welt newspaper reported on monday ray solutions make it possible to now calculate not only the flight path of ball but also predict how it will hit and bounce off wall previously it had only been possible to estimate this using computer wrote the paper what are the problems from this description what is their precise formulation also is there anywhere can read the details of this persons proposed solutions
28971 ive seen questions on how small you can make tokamak but havent yet seen any physical upper limit on the tokamak design if you take wind turbine for example doubling the linear dimensions will increase the sweep area by factor but the structural mass with factor which clearly explains why you dont want to make convensional wind turbines above certain dimensions with tokamak imagine that if you double the linear dimensions the plasma volume and hence the power production will increase eightfold whereas area that you have to protect against fast neutrons will only quadruple so once you master the tokamak technology you would only need to scale it up appropriately to bring down capital costs what do miss what cannot be scaled up easily in tokamak
28982 if you have glass of water say three quarters full and you pour it at an angle of say circ with respect to the the table the water comes out of the glass and goes directly down towards the floor however when the glass is more full or even three quarters full and the angle of pouring is far less with respect the table when the water comes out of the glass rather than going straight down it kind of stays stuck to the glass and travels down the outside of it why does this happen im sure many of you have observed it yourself by accident and ended up making mess
29007 am in the last year of msc and would like to read string theory have the zwiebach book but along with it what other advanced book can be followed which can be complimentary to zwiebach would like more mathematically rigorous book or lecture notes along with zwiebach specifically mention whether the book discusses string theory rigorously intuitively whats the scope of the book does it cover the advanced materials matrix string theory theory string field theory etc maybe even string phenomenology
29016 its been happening to me for years finally decided to ask users who are better with practical physics when was told that my experience that am going to describe momentarily prove that am diviner psychic sensibil as we call it the right explanation clearly needs some electrodynamics although its everyday electrodynamics and theoretical physicists are not trained to quickly answer such questions although each of us has probably solved many exercises that depend on the same principles when am biking under the power lines which probably have high voltage in them feel clear tingling shocks near my buttocks and related parts of the body for second or so when am under critical point of the power lines it is strong feeling not marginal one it feels like dozen of ants that are stinging me at the same moment it seems almost clear that some currents are running through my skins at hz would like to know the estimate and calculation or justification of the voltage currents etc that are going through my skin and some comparison with the shock one gets when he touches the power outlet now my bike that makes this effect particularly strong is mountain bike merida the speed is about km and the velocity is perpendicular to the direction of the current in the power line the seat has hole in it and there is some metal probably conducting one just few centimeters away from the center of my buttocks its plausible that am in touch with the metal or near touch my skin is kind of sweating during these events and the liquid isnt pure water so its probably much more conductive than pure water the temperature was today the humidity around clear skies km wind the power lines may be between kv and mv and at hz the altitude is tens of meters but dont really know exactly what kind of approximation for the electromagnetic waves are relevant what is the strength how high currents one needs does one need some amplification from interference etc special places to make the effect detectable only remember experiencing this effect at two places around pilsen the most frequent place where feel it is near druztov greater pilsen czechia is the motion of the wheels or even its frequency important is there some resonance does the hole in the seat and the metal play any role just if you think that am crazy other people are experience the effect although with different body parts see here and here this pdf file seems to suggest that the metals and electromagnetic induction is essential for the effect but the presentation looks neither particularly comprehensive nor impartial enough an extra blog discussion on this topic is here http motls blogspot com electric shocks under high voltage html
29082 read with interest about einsteins theory of relativity and his proposition about the speed of light being the universal speed limit so if were to travel in spacecraft at practically the speed of light would freeze and stop moving would the universe around me freeze and stop moving who would the time stop for
29177 im trying to determine how much dry ice or liquid nitrogen would need to cool cubic feet about liters of air from about 100f 78c or 310k to about 90f 67c or 81k im assuming that the air is comprised of about oxygen how would go about doing this
29235 in the futurama episode that darn katz they save the world by rotating the earth backwards saying it shouldnt matter which direction earth rotates if earth rotated clockwise and remained in its current counter clockwise orbit around the sun would it affect anything beyond the direction the constellations move across the sky
29311 most descriptions of spontaneous symmetry breaking even for spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum systems actually only give classical picture according to the classical picture spontaneous symmetry breaking can only happen for non linear systems classical linear systems such as harmonic oscillators can never have spontaneous symmetry breaking here linear means that the equation of motion is linear but the real quantum systems are always linear since the schrodinger equation is alway linear so how can linear quantum system have spontaneous symmetry breaking do we have simple intuitive understanding for spontaneous symmetry breaking within quantum mechanics without using the classical picture such mexican hat the logo of physics stackexchange the mexican hat does give us an intuitive and pictorial understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking in classical systems do we have an intuitive and pictorial understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum systems
29355 the feynman lectures are universally admired it seems but also half century old taking them as source for self study what compensation for their age if any should todays reader undertake im interested both in pointers to particular topics where the physics itself is out of date or topics where the pedagogical approach now admits attestable improvements
29363 what numbers did halley cook et al have what was the strategy by which they calculated the au
29427 in the star wars universe there are mentioned or rather shown two planets that had some kind of great explosion in their history first is peragus with its exposed core that partially exploded during one of early fuel mining operations on the planet the second is lola sayu the nature of the cataclysm that caused it to break is unknown both of the planets are relatively stable even though they are bit cracked are such planets possible in the real world or rather how long would such planet be stable assuming that the explosion that happened on the planet as assume nothing else could cause such state wouldnt push it out of its orbit
29443 ive learned how to add two spins which you can do with coefficients there are states one singlet three triplet states states are symmetric or antisymmetric and the quantum numbers needed are total spin and total component but how do you add three spins it should yield different eigenstates which quantum numbers do you need to characterise the states it is not as easy as using coefficients and the usual quantum numbers as for the total momentum the doubly degenerate state and quadruple degenerate state can describe only or the states you will need an additional quantum number for the degeneracy so how do you get the result actually tried out myself with large 8x8 matrix the total spin is each doubly degenerate for the additional quantum number chose the cyclic permutation spin states are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric but what is the usual way to derive this edit for reference im adding my results for up to spins from some time ago if you recall the basics of quantum mechanics with matrices it is actually straightforward matrix diagonalization and requires no specialized knowledge however you still need to find an additional operator which breaks degeneracy chose the cyclic permutation which seems to do the job please refer to the below answer since havent checked all details
29504 there was question bothering me tried solving it but couldnt so finally went up to my teacher asked him for help he told me that there was formula for electrostatic pressure rightarrow mbox pressure frac sigma epsilon and we had just to multiply it to the projected area pi when asked him about the pressure thing he never replied so what is it actually can someone derive it explain it please
29561 was told that the faster two objects move against each other the less the friction between them would be compared to if they were moving slower so does friction decrease when the body is moving faster or does it remain the same does the speed affect friction in any way
29583 is there any speed difference between blue or red light is there ever speed difference or do all types of light move at the same speed
29624 had this homework problem with capacitor parallel plate that has group of dielectrics between it like so now we were asked to find the equivalent capacitance and the distance of separation between the plates was and its area was now assumed that the individual dielectrics would act as individual capacitors and k2 would be parallel to k3 and their resultant series with k1 this was also the method found in many other books k1 frac 2k epsilon oa k2 frac epsilon oa k3 frac epsilon oa finally frac epsilon oa frac epsilon oa implies frac epsilon oa and frac frac epsilon oa frac 2k epsilon oa frac epsilon oa frac 2k epsilon oa our teach told us that the answer was incorrect when told him about the books he told us that the books had it all wrong so asked him for the solution he divided the first dielectric into two parts along the line joining the bisector of area and did the shown charge distribution later he equated the potentials and stuff like so 1q frac qd epsilon oa frac qd epsilon oa 1q frac qd epsilon oa frac qd epsilon oa then said that 1q 1q he then put the values of qq in the equation frac basically getting result that was quite different from the result given in books asked him how single plate the one in contact with the k1 dielectric could have two different charges on the same surface he told me that it was because of the accompanying dielectrics was my question valid the first point whose solution is correct
29696 im not very knowledgeable about physics generally but know that nothing can escape black holes gravitational pull not even light making them nearly invisible my question is what has been obtained from direct observation of black hole to prove their existence please note that im not questioning the existence of black holes but am just curious as to how we have come to realize it
29727 its said the earth is approaching the sun can we push it away little by little although we can emit rocket towards the sun but its too expensive to make rocket so think maybe we can recycle the rocket at first the rocket is send out with very fast speed so give back big force to the earth and then we let the rocket slowly comes back to the earth and re send it again well this solution sounds little inefficient still dont know if it works better ideas edit umm it seems the earth is leaving the sun thats ok then the question is how can we push the earth towards the sun correct the orbit by human force even if the sun turns into red giant someday we may finally find way to put the earth at safe position far enough from heat
29737 problem am trying to work out is as follows particle moves in force field given by vec phir vec prove that the angular momentum of the particle about the origin is constant set it up as follows vec vec over dt vec int frac vec dt int frac phir vec dt which is equal to frac phir vec am not sure what am doing at this point is my integrated expression correct assuming it is we get angular momentum vec times vec vec times phir vec now dont know what to do with the constant term but do know that vec times vec however the problem states that we have to prove the result is constant so think im wrong specific places where someone could help me out are is my integration correct if not how does one integrate force given in terms of position vector notation time what happens to the constant cross product of vector and scalar doesnt make any sense
29779 escape velocity from earths surface is kilometres second how long would one need to maintain this escape velocity to actually escape earths gravitational pull must this km velocity need to be maintained all the way up to geosynchronous orbit
29785 follow up question to how long must escape velocity be maintained is the escape velocity at gso
29837 ma gm rm other in newtonian mechanics the acceleration of object toward object is not dependent on the mass of object but on the mass of object and the distance between objects and because the mass of object does not affect its acceleration due to the gravitational influence of object does newtonian mechanics predict that massless particle photon would be gravitationally affected by an object with mass also would it predict that an object with mass would not be gravitationally influence by an object without mass would it also predict that two massless particles would have no gravitational influence on each other
29877 ive had two special relativity courses so far but none really gave me clear description of the process
29902 why is the center of mass of bodies which interact only via newtonian gravity located at focus of each of the elliptical orbits know that when there are no external forces the center of mass moves at constant speed but that doesnt explain it
29955 some generous assumptions we have spaceship that can reach reasonable fraction of light speed the ship is able to withstand the high energies of matter impacting at that speed given the amount of matter in inter stellar space at high speed would it encounter enough of it and frequently enough that an aerodynamic shape would significantly reduce its drag and thus save fuel
30037 from watching cosmology lectures it seems that the space between galaxies is expanding at an accelerating rate my question is since it is the space that is acceleratingly expanding the special relativity does not apply in this case in other words since it is not anything that is accelerating with relative distance would at some point galaxies that are far enough from each other separate faster than speed of light please note am not asking if the galaxies would move faster than speed of light but whether the rate of expansion of space be faster than speed of light so in effect each galaxy would be as if it is behind an event horizon where even light can not escape if yes is there name for such an event horizon that is cause by expanding space outside rather than the conventional black hole event horizon caused by stretching of space within the event horizon how would one be able to differentiate between black hole even horizon and galactic even horizon caused by accelerating expansion of space outside not sure if the concepts of inside and outside are still meaningful in such cases
30097 having only really known two designs for paper airplanes since my days as child one which flies about eight feet and another which flies about ten feet have always wondered how people manage to come up with designs that are able to fly much much further than that clearly these have no propulsion after their initial burst of energy from being thrown after that its all about gliding so what design considerations should make in order to create plane that has the maximum flight time and distance what are general best practices in this endeavor and what are the physical bases for these choices im not looking for specific designs necessarily but what qualities makes up good paper airplane that can fly for very long distance
30198 as we all know that light travels in rectilinear motion but can we bend light in parabolic path if not practically then is it possible in paper has anyone succeeded in doing that practically
30229 these three questions are phrased as alternative history questions but my real intent is to understand better how well different modeling approaches fit the phenomena they are used to describe see below for more discussion of that point short informed opinion answers are fine better actually if dmitri mendeleev had had access to and full understanding of modern group theory could have plausibly structured the periodic table of chemistry in terms of group theory as opposed to the simpler data driven tabular format that he actually used if mendeleev really had created group theory based periodic table would it have provided any specific insights perhaps early insights into quantum theory the inverse question if murray gell mann and others had not used group theory concepts such as su3 to organize particles into families and had instead relied on simple grouping and graphical organization methods more akin to those of mendeleev is there any significant chance they could have succeeded or less speculatively is it possible to create useful concise and accurate organizational structures presumably quark based that fully explain the particle data of the 1970s without making any reference to algebraic structures background my perspective on the above questions is to understand the interplay between expressive power and noise in real theory structures one way to explain that is to note that mathematical modeling of data sets has certain strong and deep similarities to the concept of data compression on the positive side good theory and good compression both manage to express all of the known data by using only much smaller number of formula characters on the negative side even very good compressions can go astray by adding artifacts that is details that are not in the original data and which therefore constitute form of noise similarly theories can also add artifacts or details not in the original data set the table style periodic table and su3 represent two extremes of representation style the table format of the periodic table would seem to have low expressive power and low precision whereas su3 has high representational power and precision the asymmetric and ultimately misleading emphasis on strangeness in the original eight fold way is an explicit example of an artifact introduced by that higher power we now know that strangeness is just fragment the first down quark parallel of the three generations issue and that strangeness showed up first only because it was more easily accessible by the particle accelerators of that time update on final answers have selected lubo motls answer as the most persuasive with respect to the questions asked if you look at the link he includes you will see that he has looked into this issue in minute detail with regards to what kind of representation works best and why since that issue of what is the most apt form of representation was at the heart of my question his answer is impressive with that said would also recommend that anyone interested in how and to what degree group theory can be applied to interesting and unexpected complexity problems even if only approximately should also look closely at david bar moshes fascinating answer about an entire conference that looked at whether group theory could be meaningfully applied to the chemical elements this excellent answer points out rich and unexpected set of historical explorations of the question if could would also flag this as an answer from different perspective finally arnold neumaiers answer shows how carefully defined subset of the problem can be tractable to group theoretic methods in away that is predictive which to me is the single most fundamental criterion for when model crosses over from being just data into becoming true theory and again would flag this one as an answer if could impressive insights all and my thanks to all three of you for providing such interesting unexpected and deeply insightful answers

30268 this comes from brain teaser but im not sure can solve it you are in rowing boat on lake large heavy rock is also in the boat you heave the rock overboard it sinks to the bottom of the lake what happens to the water level in the lake does it rise fall or stay the same id say that the water level drops because when you drop the stone in the lake the water level rises according to the volume of the stone but the water level decreases by volume of water weighting the stones weight when you take it off the boat is that correct

30341 my four year old daughter asked me why paper tends to fall apart when wet and wasnt sure speculated that the water lubricates the paper fibers so that they can untangle and separate more easily but really wasnt sure
30343 have found several discussions on how to calculate the sag of rope that is tied off at two points like tightrope and understand it to certain extent what cant wrap my head around is how come it is impossible to pull the rope tight enough that the sag goes away completely im talking about big thick ropes like tightrope that has to be strong enough to hold at least one person can pull piece of string so that its perfectly straight does this just have to do with scale like physics but im not great at it so if someone could answer this in as close to laymans terms as possible that would be greatly appreciated
30356 just out of curiosity in the game mass effect devices called mass relays contain two rotating rings one inside of the other see http www youtube com watchv qpxw5qjxhis for an example best seen around was wondering is this stable motion intuitively id say it isnt obviously the outer ring describes normal rotational motion but when the inner ring is taken into consideration it seems to me that an additional driving force is required to maintain the entire situation am right ive been trying to apply some mechanical principles to it but had no luck so far could anyone give decent mathematical description of this richard terrett pointed out that this is in fact called axis gimbal wasnt aware of this thanks

30555 clearly the susy anti commutation relations involve momentum and thus the generator of translations in spacetime alpha bar dot beta sigma mu alpha dot beta mu so would say that naively susy has something to do with spacetime since the any idiot can simply see the mu in the above as just have but at deeper level is there relation between say the and bar and spacetime alternatively without writing down the above relation how can we see that susy has something to do with spacetime thanks
30574 read that quantum chromodynamics is theory with mass gap what is mass gap in laymen terms why some theories have it which theories does not have it note searched for mass gap before asking all topics about it assume that the reader knows what it is or define it in an advanced and technical way so im looking for simple answer if possible

30597 was reading brian greenes hidden reality and came to the part about hawking radiation quantum jitters that occur near the event horizon of black hole which create both positive energy particles and negative energy particles produce the so called hawking radiation however do not understand why only the negative energy particles are being absorbed into the black hole while the positive energy particles shoot outward shouldnt there be chance that each type of particle is being absorbed by the black hole also the book mentions that negative energy particle would appear to an observer inside the black hole as positive why
30652 in 3d can calculate the total force due to gravity acting on point on the surface of the unit sphere of constant density where choose units so that all physical constants as well as the density of the sphere is int int sqrt sqrt int sqrt sqrt tfrac left right dz dy dx frac pi this force agrees with what we get if we treat the sphere as point particle at the spheres center of gravity with lumped mass frac pi so far so good but now if try to calculate the force of gravity of point on the boundary of the unit disk in 2d get infinity int int sqrt sqrt tfrac left right dy dx infty intuitively if think of the total force as the sum of contributions from nested circular rings around the point of interest the circumference of the rings scales like the force density like frac so the contribution of each ring scales like frac which diverges as to what is going on here how is the gravity potential derived is it an accident that in 3d frac is harmonic on the punctured space mathbb backslash is the right gravity potential in 2d something like log if so why and isnt it paradox if point masses in 2d orbit according to different law than coplanar point masses in 3d

30946 why is dark matter the best theory to explain the missing mass problem why is dark matter mathematically necessary to explain the missing mass problem on side not believe dark matter is definately intuitive the next logical step in physics is to accept the fact the direct observations can not always be the determining factor in the acceptance of theory positivism is not going to be the only driving force in physics forevermore one theory that seems almost as good is the supersymmetric particle what determination which are actually detectible and how would we distinguish the differences between the two references http blogs scientificamerican com observations underground xenon100 experiment closes in on dark matters hiding place http www science20 com hammock physicist dark matter plot thickens http www holoscience com wp synopsis synopsis electric galaxies
30973 am not phycisist so please forgive my ignorance this is related to my posts and this am trying to understand what is meant by the term nothing in physics or quantum field theory qft since it seems to me that this term is not used in the way we understand it in everyday language so qft seems to suggest in nutshell that things pop out of nothing but from wiki see the following quote according to quantum theory the vacuum contains neither matter nor energy but it does contain fluctuations transitions between something and nothing in which potential existence can be transformed into real existence by the addition of energy energy and matter are equivalent since all matter ultimately consists of packets of energy thus the vacuums totally empty space is actually seething turmoil of creation and annihilation which to the ordinary world appears calm because the scale of fluctuations in the vacuum is tiny and the fluctuations tend to cancel each other out so what is nothing in qft if this quote is correct can interpret it only as follows the nothing is not in the way used in everyday speech but is composed of transitions something that is about to become is this correct if yes why is this defined as nothing something that is about to become is not nothing but there is something prerequisite in very lame terms einstein was born non physicist but became physicist so if this is correct analogy then there there is something underlying that was non something that became something non something came into something because something else not nothing permitted it to become einsteins talent or mozarts would have been lost had he been born in africa or in country with no educational facilities so he would not become physicist but the required talent would be present but not come into reality could someone please help me understand this perhaps trivial to you concept
31019 questions about the reasons aircrafts fly are frequent among scientist since the time was in high school even if now work on the other side of the fluid world low re regime ive kept asking my professors advisors colleagues what was their own explanation of flight know about the controversy about the push downward considered common fallacy by the nasa website and about the anderson argument denying the erroneous principles of equal times and the overstimated role of the bernoulli theorem my best overall and simplest explanation is taken from anderson and consists in the following somehow the air reaching the first edge of the wing after the interaction with it is going donward this must be the result of some kind of force and therefore for the third newtons law there must be an opposite force of equal strenght in the opposite direction which pushes the aircraft up first why does the air go down answer the angle of attack and shape of the airfoil together with simple pressure and stagnation arguments second which is the role of the bernoulli theorem here if the air is pushed down by means of the geometry we dont need the difference of velocity between the upper and the lower part of the wing but we have this just as consequence of the change of pressure due to the shape is that right my second question actually is about the most common and sophisticated explanation the starting vortex balance the main argument is due to the kutta condition body with sharp trailing edge which is moving through fluid will create about itself circulation of sufficient strength to hold the rear stagnation point at the trailing edge the vorticity injected by means of the viscous diffusion by the boundary layer generated near the airfoil to the surrounding flow transforms in continuum of mini starting vortexes this leaves the airfoil and remains nearly stationary in the flow it rapidly decays through the action of viscosity by means of the kelvin theorem which in the 2d case is nothing but the statement that the vorticity is constant along every particles path this vorticity must be balanced by the formation of an equal but opposite bound vortex around the airfoil this vortex being causes an higher velocity on the top of the wing and lower velocity under it causing the arising of the lift by means of the bernoulli phenomenon now wonder we are assuming that the vorticity leaving the wall the no slip condition make the airfoil wall sheet of infinite vorticity by diffusion leaves the boundary layer and enters in the region where the reynolds number is high enough to allow us to apply the euler equation then the kelvin theorem valid only for inviscid fluids usually explain this using the vorticity equation that is local version in 2d of the kelvin theorem partial omega boldsymbol cdot nabla omega nu nabla omega in the boundary layer the viscosity terme dominates whereas in the outer layer it can be neglected when the vorticity arrives in the outer layer vorticity is conserved and we can say that the structures arriving from the boundary layer must be balanced in terms of vorticity by the fluid in this region and we can do this only because the circulation which is the actual constant is line integral and if we dont cross the airfoil bl region we dont have problem of any sort is this correct in this explanation the bernoulli theorem seems to be cause generating the lift through the difference of velocity is this right thanks in advance feel always kid asking about that issue and at the same time feel an actual ignorant but curious scientist
31068 personally cringe when people talk about scientific theories in the same way we talk about everyday theories was under the impression scientific theory is similar to mathematical proof however friend of mine disagreed he said that you can never be absolutely certain and scientific theory is still theory just very well substantiated one after disagreeing and then looking into it think hes right even the wikipedia definition says its just very accurate but that there is no certainty just closeness to potential certainty then got thinking does this mean no matter how advanced we become we will never become certain of the natural universe and the physics that drives it because there will always be something we dont know for certain
31071 understand that when you pluck guitar string then bunch of harmonic frequencies are produced rather than just the frequency of the desired note if this is true why does c2 sound so different from c1 mean c2 is harmonic of c1 and should therefore be heard when c1 is played why are all these harmonics produced on top of the targeted note in the first place also what happens if you dont pluck at the center of string
31105 if spaceship travels close to the speed of light say at 9c how do calculate the time as the spaceship pilot experience it thought the formula was frac sqrt where is the time it would take if traveling at but when applying this formula to the speeds 9c and 99c the time of traveling at 99c is much higher shouldnt it be the other way around or am confused
31131 understand one of the benefits of the hampson linde cycle is that there are no cold side moving parts but isnt one losing an awful lot of energy in the throttling process there must be something basic im missing here because it looks almost like this cycle destroys energy pressure drops while volume increases and temperature drops at the same time the expansion is isentropic how does that differ from an adiabatic expansion thought the condition that ds constrained gas to unique trajectory an adiabat along which it does work but unless im mistaken joule thomson expansion does no external work despite not being an expansion into an evacuated space where did the work go maybe an example might illustrate if let air out of my cars tyres is that joule thomson expansion if so doesnt the expansion do work in lifting the atmosphere by attometers if not what is an everydayish example
31175 am reading zee qft in nutshell and in appendix he has meanwhile the principal value integral is defined by int dx cal over fx lim epsilon rightarrow int dx over epsilon fx please can someone explain to me why this is the case as understood it the principal value integral is rather defined as int dx cal over fx lim epsilon rightarrow int epsilon dx over fx lim epsilon rightarrow int epsilon dx over fx where but as far as can see these two definitions are not equivalent
31199 random matrix theory pops up regularly in the context of dynamical systems was however so far not able to grasp the basic idea of this formalism could someone please provide an instructive example or basic introduction to the topic would also appreciate hints on relevant literature
31201 might planet perform figure orbits around two stars im thinking that if the two stars were equal mass and not orbiting each other then planet that were to go right between them would continue in straight line with no preference for either star but since the two stars would in fact be orbiting each other the system would be rotating and thus there would be coriolis preference for one of the stars might that preference be made to alternate stars another possibility would be if each star were in turn orbited closely by another planet which would perform three orbits for each orbit of our planet of interest then things could be timed where on one pass star as inner planet were aligned right to pull the planet of interest into an orbit and on another pass star bs inner planet would be aligned right to pull the planet of interest into an orbit so we have system of five bodies two massive stars each orbited by minor and one minor performing figure 8s is this at least plausible if contrived
31247 we already had definition of mass based on gravitational interactions since before higgs its similar to charge which is defined based on electromagnetic interactions of particles why did higgs need to introduce concept of universe wide higgs field to define mass based on interactions with it and nobody cared about the charge of an electron for example which is also basic attribute and constant
31254 would like to update my knowledge in this area that is really out of dated and stopped somewhere like ten years ago asked the very same question on my physics lecture at my studies and got the answer that although some tests and experiments were made by french scientists there is no material either natural or man made that would suffer direct lightning hit and therefore could be used to capture and store energy from lightning for future use or processing of any kind can someone tell me how does it looks now has anything changed during last ten years in this area
31273 higgs boson messenger particle of higgs field accounts for inertial mass not gravitational mass so how could it account for formation of universe as we know it today think gravity accounts for such formations not inertia is there relation between both in standard model or is there another way with which higgs boson contributed in the formation of everything
31326 browsing quora saw the following question with contradicting answers for the highest voted answer the bits are represented by certain orientations of magnetic fields which shouldnt have any effect on gravitational mass but another answer contradicts that one most importantly higher information content correlates with more energetic configuration and this is true regardless of the particular type of storage now as per einsteins most famous formula energy is equivalent to mass which answer is correct
31395 suppose you reset the parameters of the standard model so that the higgs field average value is zero in the vacuum what would happen to standard matter if the fundamental fermions go from finite to zero rest mass im pretty sure that the electrons would fly away from nuclei at the speed of light leaving positively charged nuclei trying to get away from each other looking at the solution for the hydrogen atom dont see how it would be possible to have atoms with zero rest mass electrons what happens to protons and neutrons since only very small part of the mass of protons and neutrons is the rest mass of the quarks and since theyre flying around in there at relativistic speeds already and since the nuclear force is so much stronger than the electrical force with an incredible aversion to naked color would protons and neutrons remain bound assemblages of quarks and virtual gluons would they get little larger little less massive what would happen to nuclei would they stay together if the protons and neutrons hold together and their properties change only some then might expect the same of nuclei different stable isotopes different sizes and different masses but would expect there would still be nuclei also the and particles go to zero rest mass what does that do to the electroweak interactions does that affect normal stable matter outside of nuclear decay modes is the weak force no longer weak what happens to the forces overall
31429 since the earth is slowing its rotation and as far as know each day is second longer every about years how long was an earth day near the formation of earth billion years ago wouldnt assume to just do 5b and subtract because you would think the rate of change is changing itself as seen here from wikimedia it is graphical representation of data from international earth rotation and reference systems service they decide when its time for leap second the last one being on jun the data can be found here

31482 electrons move from higher potential to lower potential when conductor is connected to battery electron move from negative terminal to positive terminal but the battery itself forms electric field like below if free electron were there on negative terminal it would follow electric field to the positive terminal my question is how is electric field set up in the wire so that electrons pass from negative terminal to positive terminal in conductor does it follow external electric field like below or sets up its own electric field how can visualize electric field inside conductor when potential difference is applied across it how can current be explained in terms of electrostatics hope it does not sound funny think my problems is this http www physicsforums com showthread phpt edit suppose two highly charges plates is connected by the conductor that allows low current can presume that the internal current inside conductor is independent of external current if the electric field is inside conductor then electric field is in same shape as conductor

31635 or why is qft better than qm there may be many answers for one example of an answer to parallel question gr is better than newtonian gravity ng because it gets the perihelion advance of mercury right you could also say that gr predicts better black hole than ng but thats harder sale for qft versus qm ive heard of the lamb shift but what else makes qft superior
31672 conservative force field is one in which all that matters is that particle goes from point to point the time or otherwise path involved makes no difference most force fields in physics are conservative conservation laws of mass energy etc but in many other applications the time paths do matter meaning that the force field is not conservative what causes force field to be non conservative could you give some examples probably outside of physics
31740 on randall munroe new blog what if he answers the question what would happen if you tried to hit baseball pitched at the speed of light http what if xkcd com he concludes the air molecules in front of this ball don have time to be jostled out of the way the ball smacks into them hard that the atoms in the air molecules actually fuse with the atoms in the ball surface each collision releases burst of gamma rays and scattered particles these gamma rays and debris expand outward in bubble centered on the pitcher mound they start to tear apart the molecules in the air ripping the electrons from the nuclei and turning the air in the stadium into an expanding bubble of incandescent plasma suppose you re watching from hilltop outside the city the first thing you see is blinding light far outshining the sun this gradually fades over the course of few seconds and growing fireball rises into mushroom cloud then with great roar the blast wave arrives tearing up trees and shredding houses everything within roughly mile of the park is leveled and firestorm engulfs the surrounding city the baseball diamond is now sizable crater centered few hundred feet behind the former location of the backstop is that all actually reasonable or is it all just hyperbole

31852 if water is flowing through big pipe is branched into branches of small pipe lets say the flow is around sec have the following questions what will be the flow rate in each of the pipes would be knowing diameter height of the pipes considering all pipes are rigid what will be the flow rate in each of the pipes if close one pipe of the branches will water flow speed increase in other pipes if yes how we can calculate the gain of speed of flow what if the pipes are non rigid will that have any effect
31872 play the flute as hobby and ive noticed that when playing middle or flat one can interrupt the air column by releasing certain key which is near the middle of the air column and yet have no effect on the pitch though the quality changes for the better ill be putting few diagrams here since it is hard describing the situation in words the black portions of the diagrams represent closed holes basically air cannot escape from here the gray represents holes which are closed due to lever action but need not be heres diagram without coloring all diagrams are click to enlarge the mouthpiece is attached on the left as marked in the diagram the second key is just ghost key connected to the first and has no hole underneath it so ill just remove it from the diagrams few examples alright normally when playing consecutive notes you make the air column shorter by releasing key for example this is this is and this is one can easily see the physics behind this an unbroken air column is formed from the mouthpiece the weird stuff now lets look at middle and flat flat here the air column is broken in between feel that both should play the same note that is but they dont can close the hole creating an unbroken air column in both cases but the sound quality diminishes bit more experimentation aka what have you tried reading this section is strictly optional but will probably help did lot of experimenting with this key turning up some interesting results hereafter im calling the key the red key and marking it as such in the diagrams when the red key is closed no air can escape and it forms part of the air column if play low flat only get clear note when the red key is closed with it open get note which has extremely bad quality as well as being off pitch this is markedly opposite with what happens on middle flat mentioned above there there is no change in pitch and the difference in quality is reversed pictured low flat for low extend the rhs of the black portion bit more note that the fingering save the red key is the same for middle flat actually this seems to be happening for all of the low notes each one is affected drastically when the red key is lifted going on to the notes immediately after flat for quality is drastically reduced when the red key is open the harmonic second fundamental of which is is more prominent than the note itself one can make the more prominent by blowing faster but this reduces quality red key closed gives clear note as it should for similar thing happens as with with the red key closed it plays normally with it open you hear medium quality first harmonic of and no at all blowing faster just gives high the notes immediately below have fingering starting from no keys pressed has to happen every octave obviously for the first few notes here lifting the red key gives you as expected im not explicitly marking the key red here otherwise itll get confusing what the correct fingering is in pressing the red key will obviously change the note to obviously lifting the red key here will get you back to one half step lower we have which again goes to when the red key is lifted it gets interesting again when we play flat lifting the red key here gives note between and and if we go down to lifting the red key gives us and bit of experimentation with the trill keys the actual holes are on the other side of the flute whereas messing with the red key for and flat produces no change of pitch messing with the trill keys which are the same size as the red key and are furthermore pretty near it does hitting the second trill key while playing gives flat one should note that this second trill key opens the hole closest to the mouthpiece note the visual similarity between this and the situation in the the weird stuff section hitting the first trill key while playing gives note between and the two trill keys are close to each other you may have to see the enlarged version to get the difference hitting the second trill key while playing flat gives note between and hitting the first trill key while playing flat gives flat no diagram here these two are the same as the last two except that the far right edge of the black portion is closer the question now the red keyand the trill keys are about half the diameter of the other keys suspect that this is quite significant here but cant explain it myself my main question is why does disturbing the air column as shown in the section the weird stuff not change the pitch one has added an escape route for air the column should then vibrate as if the remaining keys were open that is suspect that the underlying principle is the same so have few other related questions optional why does the red key not change the pitch on flat but makes it go into the second fundamental harmonic for and above why does the red key change the pitch to notes which are not harmonics instead close to one of them isnt even part of the chromatic scale it is between two notes for flat and the red key is pretty similar to the trill keys with respect to size and general location yet using trill key on changes the pitch whereas using the red key doesnt why is this so
31894 often when people give talks about semiclassical theories they are very shady about how quantization actually works usually they start with talking about partition of hbar cells then end up with something like the wkb wavefunction and shortly thereafter talk about the limit hbar rightarrow the quantity that is quantized is usually the action oint mathrm which is supposed to be half integer times pi hbar what is the curve we integrate over is it trajectory periodic orbit or anything like this and how does this connect to the partition in planck cells additionally what is the significance of the limit hbar rightarrow

31924 headed out from earth within the solar system sol and earth both may be used as reference when traveling in interstellar space with stellar systems themselves traveling at varying velocities even within the local cloud it probably gets even more discombobulating at the scale of the bubble and beyond how would one navigate say we developed interstellar travel and were able to send probe on round trip to neighbouring system the probe wouldnt be able to rely upon history of its outward trip because the systems would have moved little during the journey the same would probably apply to beacon because of the lag involved what could one use as navigation reference is there an interstellar map with system velocities and stuff maintained somewhere
31997 molecular dynamics md simulation is common approach to the classical many body problem it relies on integration of newtons equations of motion to simulate the trajectories of many particles in my limited exposure to the md literature recurring theme that think see at least on the chemical physics end of things is that md simulations are often performed in the canonical nvt ensemble why does this seem to be the case here are the common thermodynamic ensembles microcanonical ensemble nve the system is isolated the total energy is fixed every accessible microstate has equal probability that is if omega is the number of accessible microstates the probability that system is in particular microstate is frac omega please correct me if am wrong but think that the microcanonical ensemble satisfies ergodicity time averages can be replaced with ensemble averages canonical ensemble nvt the system is not isolated the system can exchange energy with heat bath the total energy of the system bath is fixed the average or equilibrium energy of the system is constant the absolute temperature is well defined is fixed think so is given by the temperature of the heat bath the probability of finding the system in some microstate with energy is given by the boltzmann distribution frac frac sum frac isothermal isobaric ensemble npt the absolute temperature and the pressure are fixed looking at this non exhaustive list of choices it seems that we can eliminate the nve ensemble from consideration because real world chemistry involves energy exchange with the environment md simulations typically do not model chemical reactions but still would say that most chemistry in the real world occurs at nearly constant pressure atmospheric pressure so the npt ensemble seems like reasonable candidate what about the nvt ensemble constant temperature perhaps seems reasonable for equilibrium real world chemistry but am not so sure about constant volume now lets jump back to my very rudimentary of md simulations in the literature in md simulations molecules sit in simulation box to which periodic boundary conditions are applied from reading some literature articles it seems that the npt ensemble is used for equilibration to obtain the simulation box size that gives an average pressure of for example atm then the system is simulated in the nvt ensemble that is the simulation boxs dimensions are held fixed hence fixing the system volume it is from this simulation in the nvt ensemble that ensemble averages are computed and the systems chemistry is analyzed why is the nvt ensemble used for md simulation production runs

32088 have question related to the interference thoughtexperiment with water waves given in the book feynman lectures on physics vol when only one hole hole is open the measured wave intensity at the second wall varies with the distance from the center it is shown in the figure as which has peak right at the point exactly opposite to the hole now my question is why is the wave intensity has the variation as given by shouldnt it be constant the hole acts as source with wave propagating in all directions from it let this wave be given as real part of jkx omega where is the distance travelled by the wave along the direction of propagation then by this equation the intensity of the wave at any point on the second wall should be the same equal to feynman assumes the wave be given as omega where is some complex number but does not mention what it is wonder how he got the intensity as when only hole is open kindly request you to explain me in detail possibly with reference as evidently seem to miss something in wave propagation image source the feynman lectures on physics vol
32251 pretty much everything we do appears to boil down to practice of newtons third law even this rug im seated upon relies upon reaction from the floor to keep me seated amongst others the same reaction helps me move sleep recline and so on what wish to know is it possible for body to move without relying upon reaction from the objects whatever in the direction it wishes to move
32269 so this has puzzled me for many year still am no closer to coming to conclusion after many arguments that is dont think it can others think it will if you have plane trying to take off whilst on tread mill which will run at the same speed as whatever the planes tires rotation speed is will it take off edited to be more clear the question is simple will plane take off if you put this plane onto treadmill that will match whatever speed the plane wheels are moving at so the plane should not be able to move this is hypothetical situation of course but am very interested
32278 higgs field is pretty simple for me to understand you have one field that creates one particle higgs boson so continue to assume one field one particle up field creates up quark down field creates down quark strong field creates gluon electron field creates electron electromagnetic field creates photon
32296 ive studied differential geometry just enough to be confident with differential forms now want to see application of this formalism in thermodynamics im looking for small reference to learn familiar concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics formulated through differential forms once again it shouldnt be complete book chapter at max or an article upd although ive accepted davids answer have look at the nicks one and my comment on it
32311 according to wikipedia here are the cygnus vital stats mass radius radius of means volume of sols divided by that means that cyg is time less dense than sol so how could it be black hole
32368 is there relativistic version of hamiltonian mechanics if so how is it formulated what are the main equations and the form of hamiltonian is it common framework if not then why it would be nice also to provide an example simple system with its hamiltonian as far as remember in relativistic mechanics we were only taught to use conservation laws that is integral invariants and thus have vague perception of relativistic dynamics
32391 what is the difference between battery and charged capacitor can see lot of similarities between capacitor and battery in both these charges are separated and when not connected in circuit both can have same potential difference the only difference is that battery runs for longer time but capacitor discharges almost instantaneously why this difference what is the exact cause for the difference in the discharge times
32422 am trying to understand how complex numbers made their way into qm can we have theory of the same physics without complex numbers if so is the theory using complex numbers easier
32427 listened to christoph weniger present his results at slac today see his paper is here http arxiv org abs and also see different analysis here http arxiv org abs the data seems convincing to me is this result consistent with theoretical expectations for dm candidates in particular is the reported estimate cross section for annihilation into photons consistent with estimated cross sections for the various wimp dark matter candidate particles like lsp dark matter candidates are there any other reasonable astrophysical mechanisms that would produce this gev photon line the summary for the talk claims using months of public gamma ray data from the fermi large area telescope we find in regions close to the galactic center at energies of gev sigma excess that is not inconsistent with gamma ray line from dark matter annihilation when taking into account the look elsewhere effect the significance of the observed signature is sigma if interpreted in terms of dark matter particles annihilating into photon pair the observations imply partial annihilation cross section of about cm and dark matter mass around gev
32481 am trying to figure out why vibrations say from an engine loosen screws it seems to me that there is evident symmetry between loosening and tightening screw am wondering what breaks this symmetry
32484 ive had this debate with some coworks what voltage rough order of magnitute is used to safely shock people safe is vague term but as an example there are arcade games where you hold onto two rods and you are hit with jolt that grows in intensity the challenge being to hold on until the end ive also seen this sort of thing at museum where you touch two contacts to feel the jolt of an electric eel not painful but you definatley feel some force going through you right now due to different interpretations of some fundamental laws of electricity we have guesses of about volts and about volts so please explain why one value is used over another
32544 can general relativity be completely described as field in flat space can it be done already now or requires advances in quantum gravity
32685 spacetime of special relativity is frequently illustrated with its spatial part reduced to one or two spatial dimension with light sector or cone respectively taken literally is it possible for or flat spacetime dimensions to accommodate maxwells equations and their particular solution electromagnetic radiation light
32691 had college student build an overclocked pc using phase change technology this is essentially an air conditioning unit with the evaporator attached directly to the motherboard he said that cold temperature made the cpu more stable at higher clock speeds ghz by affecting how the atoms and electrons behave my question is is this true if so in what way does cold temperature affect semiconductors
32699 what is the nature of nuclear energy this is closely related to the correct explanation of mass defect did some research of that topic and cannot come to single comprehensive and consistent description below are related statements gathered or can think of describing the problem area to me each of them seems to make sense but some of them are contradictory so obviously wrong please kindly point out and explain these errors the more nucleons in nucleus the bigger the nucleus is so the average distance of nucleon to each another is higher hence the long distance electromagnetic repulsion tends to overcome short distance strong nuclear force up to the point of occasional alpha decay in elements of transuranic end of the spectrum the less nucleons in nucleus the closer in average they are so the strong force per each is higher and easily overcomes electromagnetic repulsion given and the smaller the nucleus the stronger it is bound the stronger the nucleus is bound the higher its binding energy the higher the binding energy of nucleus the more energy is stored per nucleon in the system the higher the binding energy per nucleon the more difficult it is to split the atom the more difficult it is to split the atom the more stable the atom is the more energetic binding the more difficult it is to break the binding the more stable the atom made out of such bindings natural systems tend to evolve to lower not higher energy states the literature presents the binding energy chart per element with its peak at iron nucleons both the lighter and heavier elements tend to have smaller binding energy iron is the most stable element it is abundant in the universe as natural atomic evolution tends to get close to it from both ends of atomic number spectrum the surplus energy in the nuclear reaction is achieved when heavy elements are split fission or light element are fused fusion the surplus energy is the energy taken out of the system average energy per nucleus is higher before the reaction and lower after the reaction after the reaction the resulting elements are closer to the iron atomic number mass defect is directly proportional to the binding energy the stronger the binding energy per nucleon the less mass per nucleon example for neutron proton and them bound together in deuterium begin array begin alignat text mathrm hspace 50px text mathrm text text mathrm text mathrm end alignat 5px delta mathrm frac mathrm mev end array the explanation of below seemingly contradictions somehow eludes me hope it is apparent to you why the lightest elements are not the ones which are most strongly bound possibly the peak at iron might be caused the geometry factor when accounting for nucleons 3d positions the average forces between them are no longer proportional to just the number of nucleons why does iron seem to need in its properties the highest energy per nucleon as the most strongly bound most stable element and on the other hand the lowest energy per nucleon for the surplus energy be given off when approaching iron in fission fusion reactions from either side of atomic number spectrum also what is the definition and explanation of the mass defect mass defect is the surplus energy given off from fusion fission and hence is the difference between total mass energy of the system before and after reaction mass defect comes from different proportion of mass vs energy in an atom depending on its binding energy when the binding energy is higher in an atom the more of the total mass energy of the system is stored in the binding of the nucleons and less in their mass and the total stays the same if so then why does the total mass energy change after the split fuse reaction
32738 symplectic systems are common object of studies in classical physics and nonlinearity sciences at first assumed it was just another way of saying hamiltonian but also heard it in the context of dissipative systems so am no longer confident in my assumption my question now is why do authors emphasize symplecticity and what is the property they typically imply with that or in other more provocative terms why is it worth mentioning that something is symplectic
32818 im thinking of applying to do phd in string theory starting in september im gradually learning more about the subject through external reading but still most papers are impenetrable could anyone give me description of the areas of current string theory research that would be accessible for doctoral student are there any particular open problems that might be worth getting to know also any general advice on how to choose phd topic would be most welcome many thanks in advance
32830 im having discussion with someone said that it is even theoretically impossible to reach because that would imply that all molecules in the substance would stand perfectly still he said that this isnt true because my theory violates energy time uncertainty principle he also told me to look up the schr dinger equation and solve it for an oscillator approximating molecule see that its lowest energy state is still non zero is he right in saying this and if so can you explain me bit better what he is talking about
32848 silly thought feel free to shoot it down does hydrogen atom undergo any kind of change subject to its environment if one were to study hydrogen atom on the surface of mercury another above earth and third in interstellar space would they exhibit any difference
32859 statistical mechanics is used to describe systems with large number of particles the observable universe contains between to stars can we treat those many stars as statistical mechanical system for which one can define an entropy temperature etc
32882 let be the orientation angle of body such as cat and let be its angular velocity it is well known that can change even when the body is not rotating using the conservation of angular momentum that is even when thats how cats land on their feet so well but how can possibly ever change when its derivative is zero whats wrong with the math
32948 for an infinite line charge falls off with for an infinite sheet of charge its independent of the infinitesimal contributions to fall off with so why doesnt the total fall off the same way for the infinite line and sheet charges
32976 quantities like the chemical potential can be expressed as something like mu left tfrac partial partial right ev now the entropy is the log some volume which depends on the particle number as in this definition we sum over natural numbers of particles is there any good way of actually evaluating the derivative what one practically does when dealing with an ideal gas is computing the quantity gamma which might turn out to be frac pi and then one will get an expression senv which can of course be treated as if it was function over mathbb even if that assumes that one has closed expression which is function in principle id be fine with that if one has given function or at least the bunch of values for all over grid and procedure to introduce more and more grid points to get finer mash then there is notion of convergence to derivative but here the ns are clearly always at least value apart no matter how many there are thermodynamics limit the mesh doesnt get finer between any two given points you might define the derivative as computing the average rate of change between two partcle numbers and and say tfrac partial partial evaluated at gives the same value for all in one of the intervals but then you would have to postulate how to come up with in every new situation this might be overcome in very specific situations in coming up with reasonable fraction of avogadros number but this is not quite mathematical and the values of different finite difference approximation schemes are always different in full generality feel there is no categorical understanding of what the fractional dimensional space phase space in this case has to be and so the procedure of evaluation of the derivative should be explicitly postulate
33009 when talking of exponential decay as with radioactive decay the formula used wikipedia and my textbook is nt 0e lambda this formula with the decay constant lambda makes little intuitive sense it is the ratio between the amount of radioactive material and the decay at any time it might lead one to believe that after one time unit the amount of radioactive material has been decreased by factor lambda but that is not even the case much more intuitive form would be like the formula of exponential growth wrong lambda one only needs to look at that formula for second to get an intuitive understanding of the rate of the decay got curious about this and want to ask why mathematicians or physicists have chosen the first mentioned formula did miss something clever here
33240 ive heard the higgs mechanism explained as analogous to the reason that photon acts like it has mass in superconducting field however thats not too helpful if dont understand the latter why does this occur and how
33273 is the spacetime continuous or discrete or better is the dimensional spacetime of general relativity discrete or continuous what if we consider additional dimensions like string theory hypothesizes are those compact additional dimensions discrete or continuous are there experimental evidences of continuity discreteness when particles move inside space do they occupy spacetime by little chunks what would imply if spacetime is discrete on continuous theories ive found little information on the web and books probably my question is ill posed and apologize for this
33326 the fastest baseball pitch ever recorded was in at speed of frac mathrm mile mathrm hour see correction below does this mean that the pitchers hand was also traveling at that speed or just the ball is it physically possible to move hand leg at that speed im asking this because basically pitchers hand was moving inches per millisecond which is really superunbelievable speed for human update the figure originally given in this question was dated current record of frac mathrm mile mathrm hour left169 frac mathrm km mathrm hour right was set by aroldis chapman in source
33330 am high school student trying to teach himself quantum mechanics just for fun and am bit confused as fun test of my programming quantum mechanics skill decided to create computer program to model an atom initially learned about the matrix representations of quantum states the first example came across was that of polarized photon with the base states and this was all fine and dandy but then learned about the schrodinger equation which replaces these matrices with functions the way understood it both matrices and functions are just concrete representations of an element in vector space is this correct it is much easier to work with matrices in code so how do transform operators and functions hamiltonian operator and state functions specifically into their corresponding matrix forms
33333 what do we actually mean when we say that matter is wave what does the wavelength of this matter wave indicate the idea of particle behaving like wave is kinda incomprehensible to me further why is the wavelength inversely proportional to the momentum please help me out
33470 dont seem to be able to visualize tensors am reading the morgan kauffman game physics engine development and he uses tensors to represent aerodynamics but he doesnt explain them so am not really able to visualize them please explain in very simple ways just want to understand the basics
33542 im convinced that radians are at the very least the most convenient unit for angles in mathematics and physics in addition to this suspect that they are the most fundamentally natural unit for angles what want to know is why this is so or why not understand that using radians is useful in calculus involving trigonometric functions because there are no messy factors like pi also understand that this is because sinx rightarrow as rightarrow when is in radians but why does this mean radians are fundamentally more natural what is mathematically wrong with these messy factors so maybe its nice and clean to pick unit which makes frac dx sin cos but why not choose to swap it around by putting the nice and clean bit at the unit of angle measurement itself why not define angle as full turn then measure angles as fraction of this full turn in similar way to measuring velocities as fraction of the speed of light sure you would have messy factors of pi in calculus but whats wrong with this mathematically think part of what im looking for is an explanation why the radius is the most important part of circle could you not define another angle unit in similar way to the radian but with using the diameter instead of the radius also if radians are the fundamentally natural unit does this mean that not only pi textrm rad circ but also pi circ that is textrm rad
33547 know its not possible with earth today but with todays level of material science technology would it be possible to make cable strong and light enough to make space elevator system connecting mars synchronous satellite to an anchor on mars surface ignoring any load at all by an elevator car or can someone say with high degree of certainty that the level of strength to weight possible in cables today is still far from possible even with mars lower mass compared to earth
33565 cosmic rays energies can exceed tev way higher than the energy scale achieved in the lhc or that can be achieved in the near future cannot we just use them to study fundamental interactions at such extreme energy scales instead of lhc what are the difficulties in guiding and channeling such super high energetic particles and make them collide to probe fundamental physics at such super energy regime
33578 why when people textbooks talk about strong interaction they talk only about bound states of or quarks to form baryons and mesons does the strong interaction allow bound states of more than quarks if so how is the stability of bound state of more than quarks studied
33620 ive read that free neutrons decay into proton electron and neutrino with an average lifespan of about minutes is there anything physically different about neutron that has existed for minutes and one that has only existed for one minute does random outside event trigger the decay or is something internally in the neutron slowly falling apart
33621 the current is maximum through those segments of circuit that offer the least resistance but how do electrons know beforehand that which path will resist their drift the least
33760 in three dimensions the dirac delta function delta textbf deltax deltay deltaz is defined by the volume integral int text all space delta textbf dv int infty infty int infty infty int infty infty deltax deltay deltaz dx dy dz where deltax text if neq and deltax infty text if and similarly for deltay and deltaz does this mean that delta textbf has dimensions of reciprocal volume as an example textbook that am reading states for collection of point charges we can define charge density rho textbf sum delta textbf textbf where textbf and are the position and charge of particle respectively typically would think of charge density as having units of charge per volume in three dimensions text volume for example would think that units of frac text text might be possible si units of charge density if my assumption is true then delta textbf must have units of text volume like text for example is this correct
33892 most dimensionless numbers at least the ones easily found used for dimensional analysis are about fluid dynamics or transport phenomena convection and heat transfer arguably also sort of fluid mechanics my understanding of dimensional analysis is the following derive dimensionless numbers from the description of system find the ones physically meaningful and use them to compare different situations or to scale experiments is this possible in other fields like classical mechanics and their engineering applications example describe horizontal beam by frac text forces acting on the beam text forces beam can withstand without plastic deformation both parts of the ratio being functions of shape density gravity material constants etc my assumption is yes its possible but most fields outside the sort of fluid mechanics described above are easy enough to calculate without dimensional analysis
33972 in connection with classical and quantum anomalies id like to ask for simple explanation why some anomalies lead to valid quantum field theories while some others happily absent in the standard model seem to make the corresponding quantum field theory inconsistent edit more specifically in case of an anomalous gauge symmetry why cant one get valid theory by using central extension of the gauge group as the quantum version of the gauge group has this been tried and not found working giving no go theorem or would that lead to different classical theory in the limit hbar to
34001 my question is about the appearance of non analytic function in the formula for the resistive force in air or other medium considering the dimensional case as covered by walter lewin in his lecture the magnitude of the resistive force is proportional to the square of the speed of the object which we take to be sphere in other words cv with the force being in the opposite direction of the objects motion the constant depends on the spheres radius drag coefficient of air and so forth but for convenience choose values that make understand this is an approximation and in reality there is term as well as the term and maybe other terms as well but dont think that invalidates my question with that said heres is graph of the resistive force as function of because the sign of the force is opposite that of velocity the equation can be conveniently written although this function looks smooth and has derivative it doesnt have second derivative isnt it unusual for simple equation of physical phenomenon in classical mechanics to lack second derivative its unintuitive to me that the force doesnt have second derivative physically it doesnt feel like anything non smooth is going on my question is it normal to encounter functions in classical mechanics with no second derivative and if not whats the explanation for finding one here added for anyone interested in this topic related question popped up over at mathoverflow and there are several good answers
34015 possible duplicate what differs string theory from philosophy or religion find lot of people disbelieve in string theory saying that since it cannot be tested experimentally then it is not science quoting feynman who has said something along that line and that it is complete waste of time and it should not be funded etc my question is how to convince those people that string theory is real science and real physics and how to reply to the argument that if it cannot be tested experimentally then it is not science where is the flaw in this argument note added please if your answer is about attacking string theory or saying that it is science fiction and the like then do not bother answering
34049 ive been told that vacuum isnt actually empty space rather that it consists of antiparticle pairs spontaneously materialising then quickly annihilating which leads me to few questions firstly is this true and secondly if so where do these particles come from do the particles even have to come from anywhere
34084 does real macroscopic body like table human or cup permits description as wave function when is it possible and when not for example in the statistical physics part by landau lifshitz it is argued that such systems must be described via the density matrix chapter about statistical matrix as far as got it roughly speaking macroscopic bodies are so sensible to external interaction that they never can be counted as systems one have to include everything else to form system is my interpretation right when is it wrong to talk about wave functions of bodies that surround us
34113 while investigating the epr paradox it seems like only two options are given when there could be third that is not mentioned heisenbergs uncertainty principle being given up the setup is this in the wikipedia article given two entangled particles separated by large distance if one is measured then some additional information is known about the other the example is that alice measures the axis and bob measures the axis position but to preserve the uncertainty principle its thought that either information is transmitted instantaneously faster than light violating the special theory of relativity or information is pre determined in hidden variables which looks to be not the case what im wondering is why the hup is not questioned why dont we investigate whether situation like this does indeed violate it instead of no mention of its possibility has the hup been verified experimentally to the point where it is foolish to question it like gravity perhaps edit it seems that all the answers are not addressing my question but addressing waveforms commutative relations fourier transforms am not arguing against commutative relations or fourier transforms is not qm the theory that particles can be represented as these fourier transforms commutative relations what im asking this is it conceivable that qm is wrong about this in certain instances for example zero state energy or at absolute zero or in some area of the universe or under certain conditions we havent explored as in is the claim then that if momentum and position of particle were ever to be known somehow under any circumstance quantum mechanics would have to be completely tossed out or could we say qm doesnt represent particles at absolute zero or some other bizarre condition the same way we say newtonian physics is pretty close but doesnt represent objects moving at decent fraction of the speed of light example epr paradox it considered two entangled particles referred to as and and pointed out that measuring quantity of particle will cause the conjugated quantity of particle to become undetermined even if there was no contact no classical disturbance according to epr there were two possible explanations either there was some interaction between the particles even though they were separated or the information about the outcome of all possible measurements was already present in both particles these are from the wikipedia article on the epr paradox this seems to me to be false dichotomy the third option being we could measure the momentum of one entangled particle the position of the other simultaneously and just know both momentum and position and beat the hup however this is just not an option apparently clarification im not disputing that two quantities that are fourier transforms of each other are commutative both can be known simultaneously as mathematical construct nor am arguing that the hup is indeed false im looking for justification not just that subatomic particles can be models at waveforms under certain conditions earth like ones notably but that waveform is the only thing that can possibly represent them and any other representation is wrong you van verify the positive all day long that still doesnt disprove the negative it is possible that waveforms do not correctly model particles in all cases at all times this wouldnt automatically mean all of qm is false either just that qm isnt the best model under certain conditions why is this not discussed
34115 since newtonian gravity is analogous to electrostatics shouldnt there be something called negative mass also moving charge generates electric field but why doesnt moving mass generate some other field
34147 is there method to renormalize theory without using perturbative expansions for the divergences for example is there method to get masses and other renormalized quantities without using expansions and counterterms have heard about lattice gauge theory but what other solutions of examples of non perturbative renormalization numerical or analytical are there
34178 im studying for my upcoming physics course and ran across this concept id love an explanation
34179 keep reading in the physics world focus issue on vacuum technology about scientists creating high temperatures in the vacuums etc if heat is caused by thermal energy being radiated from particles due to their energy then how can there be heat in vacuum as there are no particles present
34203 curiositys power source comes from radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg rather than from solar panels like the two mars rovers watts of thermal power from alpha particle emission in kg of pu half life years yields about watts of electric power via the seebeck effect thermocouples this source slowly declines in power output year and is expected to provide reliable power source for years it appears that the efficiency of curiositys rtg is only why is the rtg efficiency so small is there problem maintaining greater hot cold junction delta temperatures or are there other issues
34241 in considering the special relativistic em field understand that assuming lagrangian density of the form mathcal frac mu nu mu nu frac mu mu and following the euler lagrange equations recovers maxwells equations does there exist first principles derivation of this lagrangian reference or explanation would be greatly appreciated
34312 recently read an article that there is dark matter around the sun but if it is so than why can we see it clearly if it is called matter than it shall show some hindrance in radiation we receive and the solar flares must bounce back against them though they are coming straight to us to stay close to sun it has to be rotating at very very high speed so does it does it pose some kind of gravitational effect on the rest of the system is it constant or does it increase or decrease in size
34352 light is clearly affected by gravity just think about black hole but light supposedly has no mass and gravity only affects objects with mass on the other hand if light does have mass then doesnt mass become infinitely larger the closer to the speed of light an object travels so this would result in light have an infinite mass which is impossible any explanations
34395 the rear wheels of car always face in the direction the car is moving the front wheels are able to turn left or right and thus can point in the direction the car is moving towards what dont understand is how car can turn with all four wheels rotating not skidding that is how is it possible that the front two tires can face in one direction the rear two tires in another direction with the four tires all connected by rigid rods and with all four tires rotating without skidding im trying to visualize this assuming the car is moving very slowly but even then the situation just seems impossible to me is it in fact that the rear tires are skidding in just very small micro steps so that we dont actually observe it happening
34407 suppose there is fully functional space elevator built on earth the base is attached to coordinates lambda varphi on the equator on the zero meridian what would happen if we were to suddenly remove the counterweight at what speed would the tip hit the earth and at what coordinates all approximate might be missing something but found this scenario exceptionally difficult to model properly was trying to get general equations so for arbitrary material planet etc suspect the equations involved will be quite messy so please use abbreviations substitutions references to standard transformations etc where possible ignore the atmosphere and any carts stations other masses attached to the elevator assume spherical earth etc for completeness it is scenario described in the mars trilogy by kim stanley robinson so this is purely pet project
34516 em radiation has relativistic mass see for instance does photon exert gravitational pull and therefore exerts gravitational pull intuitively it makes sense to include em radiation itself in the galactic mass used to calculate rotation curves but ive never actually seen that done before so if we were to sum up all the electromagnetic radiation present in galaxy what fraction of the dark matter would it account for
34522 agev means gev per nucleon but why letter is used for such short cut why not ngev for example
34544 if you have an infinite memory infinite processor number classical computer and you can fork arbitrarily many threads to solve problem you have what is called nondeterministic machine this name is misleading since it isnt probabilistic or quantum but rather parallel but it is unfortunately standard in complexity theory circles prefer to call it parallel which is more standard usage anyway can parallel computer simulate quantum computer thought the answer is yes since you can fork out as many processes as you need to simulate the different branches but this is not proof because you might recohere the branches to solve pspace problem that is not parallel solvable is there problem strictly in pspace not in np which is in bqp can quantum computer solve problem which cannot be solved by parallel machine jargon gloss bqp bounded error quantum polynomial time the class of problems solvable by quantum computer in number of steps polynomial in the input length np nondeterministic polynomial time the class of problems solvable by potentially infinitely parallel nondeterministic machine in polynomial time polynomial time the class of problems solvable by single processor computer in polynomial time pspace the class of problems which can be solved using polynomial amount of memory but unlimited running time
34573 so ive heard from various works of science fiction about the prospect of turning jupiter into star from what know about the physics of such task it would require somehow condensing jupiter into something quite bit smaller than it currently is such that the pressure is sufficient to create spontaneous fusion so my questions are all assuming that somehow this is possible what would be the results specifically im curious as to what kind of light there would be what size would jupiter have to shrink to manage fusion and something about the temperature light output longevity and other properties that such body would have to have specifically im going to assume that it is possible to somehow force jupiter to shrink to the minimum size required to fuse its current atmospheric composition spontaneously however this might be able to happen also know that fusion forces tend to exert an expansion force lets assume that this can be managed such that the size would remain constant
34632 the coulombs force is given by over when rightarrow rightarrow infty does this mean two electrons never touch each other
34644 two very intriguing papers recently appeared on the arxiv claiming that one can use superqubits supersymmetric generalization of qubits to violate the bell inequality by more than standard quantum mechanics would allow that is they claim one can violate the tsirelson bound which says that the chsh game can be won quantum mechanically with probability at most cos2 the first paper is by borsten bradler and duff and the second is by bradler alas remain deeply confused about the physical meaning of these results if any as the authors define them superqubits seem to involve amplitudes that can be grassmann numbers rather than just complex numbers while know next to nothing about the topic that seems like fundamental departure from supersymmetry in the sense that high energy physicists use the term take it that supersymmetry is just proposed new symmetry of nature alongside the many other symmetries we know and doesnt involve tampering with the basic rules of quantum mechanics or with spatial locality in particular in supersymmetric theories one still has unit vectors in complex hilbert space unitary transformations etc if thats correct though then what on earth could superqubits have to do with supersymmetry in physics besides perhaps just repurposing some of the same mathematical structures in totally different context is there any possibility that if nature were supersymmetric in such and such way then one could do an actual experiment that would violate tsirelsons bound
34733 as we all know air consists of many gases including oxygen and carbon dioxide found that carbon dioxide is heavier than o2 does the volume difference neglect the mass difference is it same for all other gases in air or is there another force that keeps all of these gases together if take breath of fresh air will the exhaled air be heavier because of its higher co2 content will it fall on the floor
34834 am preparing for the exam and need to know the answer to one question which cant understand give an example of non hamiltonian systems in case of infinite number of particles for finite number of particles hope somebody can help me
34874 could someone judge my stoner hypothesis that the speed of light has changed over time as the universe has expanded in volume light has slowed down perhaps going so far as back to the big bang when it was infinitely fast and there was no time because everything happened at once etc thinking that the speed at which information can propagate through the universe is linked to the size of it seems intuitive to me my question is there an easy disproof of this would einstein have to be wrong does it violate anything supposedly more fundamental such as quantum or string theories do any current experiments invalidate it if not can you show me in any case why you think its unlikely edit im accepting mark answer but will post this here because there is character limit on comments mark thanks good answer but as someone who has only read some popular physics and should leave this to the experts im still muddled in my personal theory dont see why you should need two units to measure the speed of light the thing have hard time wrapping my head around is the relation of time and distance they seem like they could fundamentally be the same thing if you say time is measured fundamentally by the vibration of so and so quantum object in space why cant we just measure that vibration distance as the constant ill repeat myself to try to be clear there is certain minimum distance that particles have to go to interact with each other if it wasnt vibrating there wouldnt be timeits what creates the illusion of time so instead of talking about speed or as distance time cant we simply talk about that distance quantum object vibrates ill lead up to my point perhaps there can need be only one constant here and that is the physical size of the universe tiny metal tuning fork doesnt appear to be vibrating at all but if you blew it up to the size of the empire state building the metal rods would move from window to window perhaps as our universe expanded in size the length of that minimum vibration perhaps infinite at point zero would have expanded and therefore created the illusion of time and the speed of light which as the universe expands will continue slowing down perhaps we are like big balloon and we have been blown up and all the fields particles without size are vibrating more and more in that space am missing something obvious here
34947 wikipedia claims the following more generally the normal concept of schr dinger probability wave function cannot be applied to photons being massless they cannot be localized without being destroyed technically photons cannot have position eigenstate and thus the normal heisenberg uncertainty principle does not pertain to photons edit we can localize electrons to arbitrarily high precision but can we do the same for photons several sources say no see eq for an argument that says in so many words that if we could localize photons then we could define current density which doesnt exist or something like that ill admit dont fully understand its the above question that id like clarification on
34993 update thanks everyone for the wonderful replies learned something extremely interesting and relevant namely the basic way decoherence works in qft even though it wasnt what thought wanted to know when asked the question partly inspired by wolfgangs answer below just asked new question about gambini et al montevideo interpretation which if it worked as claimed would provide completely different sort of gravitational decoherence this question is about very speculative technology but it seems well defined and its hard to imagine that physics se folks would have nothing of interest to say about it for what follows ill assume that whatever the right quantum theory of gravity is its perfectly unitary so that theres no problem at all creating superpositions over different configurations of the gravitational metric ill also assume that we live in de sitter space suppose someone creates superposition of the form frac left right rangle left right rangle sqrt where represents large mass on the left side of box and represents that same mass on the right side of the box and suppose this mass is large enough that the and states couple detectably differently to the gravitational field but on the other hand that all possible sources of decoherence other than gravity have been removed then by our assumptions we ought to get gravity induced decoherence that is the state will get entangled with one sphere of gravitational influence spreading outwards from the box at the speed of light and the state will get entangled with different such sphere with the result being that someone who measures only the box will see just the mixed state frac left right rangle left langle right left right rangle left langle right my question is now the following is there any conceivable technology consistent with known physics and with our assumption of ds space that could reverse the decoherence and return the mixed state to the pure state if so how might it work for example if wed had sufficient foresight could we have surrounded the solar system with gravity mirrors which would reflect the outgoing spheres of gravitational influence back to the box from which theyd originated are exotic physical assumptions like negative energy matter needed to make such mirrors work the motivation of course is that if theres no such technology then at least in ds space wed seem to have phenomenon that we could justifiably call true in principle irreversible decoherence without having to postulate any penrose like objective reduction process or indeed any new physics whatsoever and yes im well aware that the ads cft correspondence strongly suggests that this phenomenon if it existed would be specific to ds space and wouldnt work in ads note was surprised that couldnt find anyone asking this before since whatever the answer it must have occurred to lots of people vaguely related questions is decoherence even possible in anti de sitter space do black holes play role in quantum decoherence
35034 im sorry if this question is too trivial for this forum am layman when it comes to physics though did cover the high school physics courses was wondering what happens to the electricity that is generated by your own solar panel in case you dont use any electricity in your home does it turn from electrical energy into heat or does something else happen is the energy lost for practical purposes follow up question in case the energy is lost for practical purposes wouldnt that be an enormous waste of energy is this what the smart grid network is intended for to distribute the energy to other places where it is needed thereby minimizing the energy loss and co emissions
35090 see the principle of relativity here the principles of mathematical physics this was written by poincar in year before einstein published his theory of relativity it appears from this and other writings of poincar that poincar discovered the theory of special relativity before einstein so why does einstein get the credit
35139 basic facts the worlds deepest mine is miles deep railguns can acheive muzzle velocity of projectile on the order of km the earths escape velocity is km it seems to me that railgun style launch device built into deep shaft such as an abandoned mine could reasonably launch vehicle into space have not run the calculations and wouldnt doubt that there might be issues with high gs that limit the potential for astronauts on such vehicle but even still it seems like it would be cheaper to build such launch device and place powerplant nearby to run it than it is to build and fuel single use rockets so what is the possibility of railgun assisted orbital launch what am missing here why hasnt this concept received more attention
35156 we know that space cannot spread sound wave as there is no air or medium that would support the spread of sound wave however if we put ourselves in the vicinity of an exploding star would it be possible to hear something the question arises from the idea that within the explosion of star first few seconds or less you may hear noise due to the explosion of the star
35177 when photon of light hits mirror does the exact same photon of light bounce back or is it absorbed then one with the same properties emitted if the same one is bounced back does its velocity take all values on cc or does it just jump from to when it hits the mirror or is the phenomenon of mirror better explained using wave analogy if so what is this explanation
35306 im phd student in math and am really excited about celestial mechanics was wondering if anyone could give me roadmap for learning this subject the amount of information about it on the internet is overwhelming and honestly dont know where should start any help would be greatly appreciated
35328 in one of the first lectures on qm we are always taught about youngs experiment and how particles behave either as waves or as particles depending on whether or not they are being observed want to know what about observation causes this change
35606 the more learn about general relativity the more it seems like it isnt fully understood it seems that before its full consequences were exhaustively understood not years after its discovery qm came on the scene and stole the limelight now it seems like boring field without much funding even though all but the most trivial and artificial types of solutions to the field equations are known here for example ron maimon describes how classically type of black hole allows solutions in which particle can cross the event horizon and then exit the event horizon at an earlier time seemingly leading to causal paradoxes it sounds like this is an issue that was never fully resolved it seems the sort of very messy thing that once properly understood could lead to some very odd physical behavior is it possible that all particles are just extremal black holes and that quantum mechanics is just an emergent property of the solution to einsteins field equations for the interactions between extremal black holes going backwards and forwards and time does something like bells inequality rule out this sort of idea edit there are some papers purporting to do this mitchel porter pointed out these mccorkle hadley also found mccorkle and then there is mendel sachs who has written number of books purporting to derive qm from gr
35674 was coding physics simulation and noticed that was using discrete time that is there was an update mechanism advancing the simulation for fixed amount of time repeatedly emulating changing system though that was interesting and now believe the real world must behave just like my program does it is actually advancing forward in tiny but discrete time intervals
35691 inverted the waveform of given song and was wondering what will happen the result is that it sounds the exact same way as before used audacity and doublechecked if the wave form really is inverted the second thing tried was removed the right channel duplicated the left one and set the duplicated layer as right channel this way made sure that both channels are exactly the same then inverted the second channel only thought that this would create some kind of anti noise but it didnt why is that
35758 am by no means an expert in this field however something puzzles me about the speed of light and the relativity of time and space space time is is universally acknowledged that the speed of light is the universal speed limit and that nothing can travel faster than light that is measurement based on man made interpretation of time hours minutes and seconds etc are man made there is nothing natural dictating how long second should be for instance according to einstein time and space bend around the physical matter of the universe so for example time near or on the surface of super massive black hole should be drastically slower relative to that of earth lets say for example that for every second that passes on the black hole seconds pass on earth so essentially time on the surface of the black hole is times slower than the time on earth given the example above is the speed of light at the surface of the black hole still or is it
35843 capacitor is charged it is then connected to an identical uncharged capacitor using superconducting wires each capacitor has the charge as the original so the energy so we only have the energy we started with what happened my first thoughts were that the difference in energy is due to heat produced in the wire it may be heat or it may be that this is needed to keep equilibrium
35987 possible duplicate why is there frac in frac mv llo have question about kinetic energy formula as you know in kinetic energy formula we have large frac mv okay and we know joule energy unit is large kg frac guys please light me up if im wrong heres my question why do we have frac in our formula why do we divide our mv please answer in simple word
36055 know this might sound like more of an engineering question that about physics and it probably is but bear with me im still not sure if the answer to my question lies in the physics or in the engineering or even in the politics most if not all of modern submarines are powered by nuclear reactor at sea only the most heavyweight like air carriers use nuclear reactor but ive never heard of nuclear powered aircraft is there weight to power density relation making it difficult or impossible to have nuclear aircraft or is something related to perceived safety politics
36071 have projector that creates large image even if the distance to the screen is short the device is very small approximateley 10x10 cm if you look from above the height is only cm could remove and replace the builtin lense pack to make the size of the projected image smaller but id prefer to keep the device unchanged what types of lenses in front of the unchanged device would be reqired to make the image dramatically smaller have measured the following with the original device if the distance from the focal point to the screen is cm the width of the image on the screen is approx200 cm and if is as far as cm then cm what can do to make the image smaller so its new width would be approx cm at distance cm lenses mirrors or prisms would be ok but somehow guess or lenses would do the trick what type of lenses would this be how do choose and calculate the type and the parameters of the lense can you teach me how to choose and understand the formula the quality of the image and the resolution should still be good afterwards of course can have image if move the projector close enough but that is not the solution am looking for tried also to find this out by myself already visited two camera stores and talked with the owners also visited optician retail stores but no one there could answer this question have some basic knowledge of physics and also tried to solve this by reading books about optics and geometrical optics but without any success also tried with some lenses could get my hands on but could not solve it the problem also had to deal with was that as soon as moved the lenses little further away from the device they were too small to catch the whole beam
36092 this diagram from wikipedia shows the gravitational potential energy of the sun earth two body system and demonstrates clearly the semi stability of the and lagrangian points the blue arrows indicate lower potential energy red higher so any movement in the plane perpendicular to the masses would require energy and without it an object there would settle however the and are claimed to be stable even though the direction arrows indicate its at the top of gravity well and would fall into lower potential energy in any direction what is it that makes these points stable if not gravity what am missing
36114 am learning about waves intro course and as was studying wave functions got little confused the book claims that the wave function of sinusoidal wave moving in the direction is yxt coskx wt however see drawing of the wave and they always seem to be cos graphs are sinusoidal waves always cosine graphs or can they be sine if ever see sine wave then does that mean that this is merely pulse wave travelling once and not oscillating in periodic motion sorry for the basic beginners question
36167 friend offered me brain teaser to which the solution involves pound man juggling two pound balls to traverse bridge having maximum capacity of only pounds he explained that since the man only ever holds one pound object at time the maximum combined weight at any given moment is only pounds and the bridge would hold corrected him by explaining that the acts of throwing up and catching the ball temporarily make you heavier an additional force is exerted by the ball to me and by me onto the bridge due to the change in momentum when throwing up or catching the ball but admitted that gentle tosses catches less acceleration might offer situation in which the force on the bridge never reaches the combined weight of the man and both balls can the bridge withstand the man and his balls
36286 ive seen the action of linearized gravity in many places we basically have cal sim frac left frac alpha beta box alpha beta frac box cal right in the gauge where the trace reversed field is divergenceless im doing some field theory on linearized gravity backgrounds by treating mu nu as massless spin field cant seem to find the cal terms in the lagrangian anywhere know how to evaluate it but it looks nasty are there any known references that just lists the next to leading order terms in the above lagrangian

36384 orthochronous lorentz transform are lorentz transforms that satisfy the conditions sign convention of minkowskian metric lambda geq how to prove they form subgroup of lorentz group all books read only give this result but no derivation why is this condition lambda geq enough for lorentz transform to be orthochronous the temporal component of transformed vector is lambda lambda lambda lambda the positivity of lambda alone does not seem at first glance sufficient for the preservation of the sign of temporal component and how to prove that all lorentz transform satisfying such simple conditions can be generated from for those who think that closure and invertibility are obvious keep in mind that left bar lambda lambda right neq bar lambda lambda but instead left bar lambda lambda right bar lambda lambda bar lambda lambda bar lambda lambda bar lambda lambda and im looking for rigorous proof not physical intuition

37644 was reading an article in this months issue of physics world magazine on the three main theories of extra dimensions and stumbled across something didnt quite understand when the author began talking about detecting particles in extra dimensions at particle lab such as the lhc in geneva switzerland the energy of particle in dimensional space consists of its rest energy mc and the kinetic energy of its motion if extra dimensions do exist then the particle will have extra space to move in so will obtain an additional independent contribution to its kinetic energy since we dont observe the motion of the particle in the extra dimension this kinetic energy will be interpreted as rest energy or in other words the mass of the particle this is all understood perfectly fine but it is this quote that comes next that confuses me to us the particle would not look like one particle but set of particles all with different masses why would the particle look like set of particles rather than just the one that is being observed furthermore why would they all have different masses how many particles would there be in this set please keep your answers as simple as possible as am just layman
37662 why cant we see light the thing which makes everything visible is itself invisible why is it so
37756 currently im years old going to secondary school so my ideas might be totally wrong know that everything is relative in the example of speed the earth moves and the galaxy moves etc my physics teacher told me that the speed of light is absolute which means that the speed of the light source doesnt influence the speed of light in space so was thinking that that fact could helps us to measure the absolute speed of our planet in space not relative to the sun or the galaxy the way of measuring it was following is the light emitter is the light sensor in combination with very very precise timer is the signal broadcasting point is light going from to so how it works in my head is that you send signal from to both and the distances from to and from to are equal so this should get the signal to both and in the same time the distance between and is constant say as soon as the signal reaches and at the same moment starts the very precise timer and waits for the light coming from at the same time starts emitting light according to my knowledge you should be able to calculate the speed of the whole situation along the axis ab why because if our absolute speed is along with the light direction it should take longer for the light to reach because the distance is bigger otherwise we are moving in the opposite direction of the emitted light so we are going towards the light so we make the distance for the light to travel shorter because we are concede towards the light compare it with car driving on the highway next to high speed train the train goes faster than the car compare both situations train and car moving in the same direction train starts behind the car train and car moving in opposite direction towards each other in situation it will take longer for the car and train to meet in situation it will be pretty quick that they meet because they going towards each other it is that difference in time that can be used to calculate our absolute speed think to define our absolute velocity vector we can do this measurements three times each test perpendicular to the two others so we can apply pythagoras to get our absolute speed as scalar my teacher could hardly believe that it would work so he thought that something should be wrong to my theory what do you think assuming that we have very precise measuring tools
37772 pretty simple question but not an obvious answer at least not to me mean you cant just place dead fly on the wall and expect it to stay there he will fall off due to gravity at first thought it maybe friction but that would require normal force perpendicular to the wall and then remembered spiders geckos etc they like to walk around on the ceiling how is it possible what kind of forces are involved would these creatures still be able to do it on hypothetical surface which was perfectly flat

37912 on long enough cosmological time scales hydrogen and helium nucleii will become scarce in the universe it seems to me that any advanced civilisations that might exist in that epoch would have the motivation to try and prevent the stars from using them up in order to burn the fuel more slowly and extract greater proportion of the energy as usable work one might say that on time scales measured in trillions of years the stars are an unsustainable use of the universes fuel this question is about whether such civilisations would have the means to do something about it my questions are what would be the most energy efficient way using known physics to blow apart star or otherwise prevent or greatly slow the rate at which it performs fusion were assuming this civilisation has access to vast amounts of energy but doesnt want to waste it unnecessarily since the aim is to access energy from the hydrogen the star would have burned in order for this to be worthwhile the energy gained from doing this would have to be substantially more than the energy the process takes what would be the astronomical signature of such an activity if it was happening in distant galaxy would we be able to detect it from earth update im still interested in this question there are some great answers below but currently dont feel that any of them approach the most efficient way to solve the problem way likely to be attempted by civilisation with the resources and motivation to do so lubo answer makes it clear that the energy requirements are not too stringent in themselves you just need to skim off small fraction of nearby gas giant and fuse the hydrogen into heavier elements this question already presupposes the ability to extract power from fusion on literally astronomical scale but points out that no bomb made of atoms can enter star and blow it up however this does not rule out other methods such as increasing the stars angular momentum through some means as in alanses answer or somehow perhaps electromagnetically removing plasma from its surface rather than blowing it up from the inside if removing plasma from the surface is possible then ideas based on this have certain appeal because the resulting hydrogen could be fused releasing energy that could be used to skim off more and so on exponentially kind of like the opposite of that bit in the film when self replicating monolith turns jupiter into star some of the resulting energy could be put into increasing the stars angular momentum as well however dont know enough about plasma physics to know whether theres way to suck the plasma up from the stars surface it can be done gravitationally of course but then the hydrogen just ends up being depleted by runaway fusion on the surface of another star so this isnt very useful given this my current specific questions are is there plausible way to remove material from the surface of star at an appreciable rate either electromagnetically or through some other means if so is there anything other than the virtually unlimited availability of energy that limits the rate at which this could be done given sufficiently huge supply of energy is there an effective way to rapidly increase stars angular momentum it seems per alanses answer that redirecting the stars radiation would take too long but perhaps firing massive objects or particle beams at it would accomplish the same effect in shorter time aside from these ideas would adding heavier elements than hydrogen to the star suppress fusion by absorbing neutrons what quantities would be required in order to affect the stars evolution by this method civilisation that eats stars will generate huge supply of stable nucleii as waste product so maybe it makes sense to simply dump some of them into the next star

37998 the delta baryons also called delta resonances are family of subatomic hadron particles which have the symbols delta delta delta and delta and electric charges and elementary charge respectively existence of the delta with its unusual electric charge was crucial clue in the development of the quark model three same quarks delta uuu and two electric charge isnt it impossible could the fractional model of quarks electric charge turn out to be false leptons dont have fractional electric charge here are some resources to help you quit smoking quarks do not exist everything is made up of positrons and electrons all real free particles have charge of only quarks have fractional charges which find unncessary since all particles could be made up of whole charge positrions and electrons can anyone cite particle that could not be made up of positrons electrons and must be made up of charge fraction quarks fractional electric charges were not proposed by qcd but by the quark model which came beforehand qcd offered number of inconclusive predictions such as color force and fractional electric charges wrong fractional electric charges were not proposed by qcd but by the quark model which came beforehand on the breakdown of quarks fractional electric charge values this thought that quarks have fractional electric charge values may not be true according to ahmad reza estakhr research in the field of qcd quantum chromo dynamics three times the elementary charge depending on flavor up charm and top quarks called up type quarks have electric charge of zero which means up type quarks are uncharged while down strange and bottom quarks called down type quarks just could have electric charge of plus or minus one in estakhrs model down type quarks are results of electroweak interaction between charged leptons and anti leptons and up type quarks and this is the reason that quarks do not have fractional electric charge values which means charge of hadron is not the sum of the charge of its constituent quarks it is just sum of the charge of down type quarks nuclear forces part in the early when physicist by the name of murray gell mann put forward the hypothesis for the existence of quarks he speculated that the charge of an up quark was two thirds of proton and the down quark was one third of an electron charge in this way proton consisting of two ups and one down quark would have charge of the benefit of such fractional charges is that neutron could then be said to consist of two downs and one up quark giving it net charge of neutral charge would suggest that this neutron model must surely be wrong we know that neutron decays into proton and electron for this model to be correct it would require that down quark transform itself into an up quark changing both its charge type and strength from to and that an electron essentially be produced from nowhere perhaps this is possible but simple neutron proton electron model seems far more likely here is the solution if anyone can disprove the existence of three triplets of quarks for uuu neq delta or prove that delta have electric charge of zero then fractional model of quarks electric charge will breakdown

38121 ive read bit on harold whites recent work paper on nasas site havent been able to find any comments by people claiming to know anything about the physics involved is this really serious from blog post first link in this question but interesting things have developed since the original alcubierre paper running quickly through what white told the houston audience chris van den broeck was able to reduce the energy costs of warp drive significantly and other theorists have continued to drop the numbers white team has been examining ways to continue that progression but what is eye catching is that he is working on laboratory experiment to perturb spacetime by one part in ten million using an instrument called the white juday warp field interferometer to create the minute spacetime disruption

38286 while deriving hamiltonian from lagrangian density we use the formula mathcal pi dot phi mathcal but since we are considering space and time as parameters why the formula mathcal pi mu partial mu phi mathcal is not used is there any particular book lecture notes dealing with these kind of issues in theoretical physics would love to know them
38343 in this paper theres the following sentence and the factor takes into account that the dipole moment is an induced not permanent one without any further explanation looked through griffiths electrodynamics to see if this was standard sort of thing but couldnt find anything was thinking it might be because the field of the dipole itself opposes the inducing field but that doesnt quite seem right for some reason
38348 here is question thats been bothering me since was sophomore in university and should have probably asked before graduating in analytic lagrangian mechanics the derivation of the euler lagrange equations from the principle of least action assumes that the start and end coordinates at the initial and final times are known as consequence any variation on the physical path must vanish at its boundaries this conveniently cancels out the contributions of the boundary terms after integration by parts and setting the requirement for minimal action we obtain the equations this is all nice and dandy but our intention is finding the location of particle at time in the future which we do not know priori after we derive any equations of motion for system we solve them by applying initial values instead of boundary conditions how are these two approaches consistent

39100 it is said that if the earth were black hole it would be the size of peanut how is this density possible are atoms really that sparse that they can be compressed so tightly is there some other physical dimension that the matter gets sucked into

39128 in normal atom there is limit of electrons per obital due to the pauli exclusion principle have seen people talking about replacing an electron with muon but since muons and electrons are distinguishable would this then allow electrons and muons to occupy the same orbital or would only leptons be allowed to have the same set of quantum numbers for example would beryllium atom with muons and electrons use only the 1s orbital or would the 2s be used as well spectroscopic methods should be able to distinguish between the two
39165 week ago asked people on this site what mathematical background was needed for understanding quantum physics and most of you mentioned linear algebra so decided to conduct self study of linear algebra of course im just week in but have some questions how is this going to be applicable to quantum physics have learned about matrices addition subtraction multiplication and inversion and about how to solve multiple equations with unknowns using matrices and now am starting to learn about vectors am just week in so this is probably not even the tip of the iceberg but want to know how this is going to help me also say master linear algebra in general in half year im in high school but im extremely fast with maths what other types of math would need to self study before being able to understand rudimentary quantum physics mathematically
39193 was wondering if it is possible to move the atom nucleus and leave behind the electrons can imagine that the electrons will follow the nucleus but what if the speed of the nucleus is almost the same as the speed of the electrons or faster where will the electrons go if it is not possible do we have theory can read to explain what could happen edit as of the comments core actually refers to nucleus changed
39205 suppose have something like mu nu mu nu where the einstein summation convention is implied now suppose want to to take the derivative partial mu frac partial partial mu how would go about doing this figure its not just going to be partial mu mu nu nu
39215 if punch wooden board hard enough and it breaks in two has the board still exerted force of equal magnitude on my fist when the board breaks in two due to my force the halves have component of acceleration in the direction of my striking fist that implies the board did not exert an equal and opposite reaction no
39253 suppose we have spacecraft just inside the event horizon of black hole struggling to escape but slowly receding into it another bigger black hole expands until its event horizon includes the spacecraft as well this pulls both the black hole and space craft into itself as the spacecraft is closer to the second black hole it receives more force perhaps just enough to pull it out is it possible that the spacecraft even momentarily is pulled out of the event horizon of the original black hole although it is now trapped inside the event horizon of the new one
39347 what does the term limb of the earth see this question for example or atmospheric limb mean the phrase strikes me as very odd since earth is nearly spherical do other planets with atmospheres also have limb
39442 does anyone have semi intuitive explanation of why momentum is the fourier transform variable of position by semi intuitive mean already have intuition on fourier transform between time frequency domains in general but dont see why momentum would be the fourier transform variable of position id expect it to be derivative instead
39467 could someone with access to this paper which claims to have new transformations between frames with relative motion faster than light which are supposedly consistent with special relativity say what the new transformations are and why they might make sense
39476 im reading often that possible reason to explain why the nobel committee is coping out from making the physics nobel related to the higgs could be among other things the fact that the spin of the new particle has not yet been definitively determined it could still be or this makes me wonder if the spin would very very surprisingly finally be discovered to be this then necessarily would mean that the particle has to be graviton or could there hypothetically be other spin particles if not why not and if there indeed exist other possibilities what would they be
39497 im often looking for old physics papers that had big impact on science nobel prize for example but cant seem to find lot of them is there reason why some papers are not digitally available but others that had less impact are specifically currently im looking for bragg the diffraction of short electromagnetic waves by crystal proceedings of the cambridge philosophical society does anybody know where to find it online have access to most of the journal databases
39542 the derivation of both klein gordon equation and dirac equation is due the need of quantum mechanics or to say more correctly quantum field theory to adhere to special relativity however excpet that klein gordon has negative probability issue do not see difference between these two what makes klein gordon describe scalar field while dirac describe spin field edit oops klein gordon does not have non locality issue sorry for writing wrongly edit can anyone tell me in detail why psi field is scalar in klein gordon while psi in dirac is spin mean if solution to dirac is solution to klein gordon how does this make sense
39590 when we first discovered the proton and neutron im sure scientists didnt think that it was made up of quark arrangements but then we figured they could be and experiments proved that they were so what is it about the electron that leads us to believe that it isnt composite particle what evidence do we have to suggest that it it isnt
39595 if the universe is flat and the total energy of the universe can be zero we dont know if it is but many theorists support the idea at bb initial conditions then is it possible that all matter in the universe could have emerged from nothing if so that what is the total energy of the matter compensated by edit yes ive watched the lecture by lawrence krauss and know about his book havent read it though guess its too difficult for me
39602 position momentum energy and other observables yield real valued measurements the hilbert space formalism accounts for this physical fact by associating observables with hermitian self adjoint operators the eigenvalues of the operator are the allowed values of the observable since hermitian operators have real spectrum all is well however there are non hermitian operators with real eigenvalues too consider the real triangular matrix left begin array ccc end array right obviously this matrix isnt hermitian but it does have real eigenvalues as can be easily verified why cant this matrix represent an observable in qm what other properties do hermitian matrices have which for example triangular matrices lack that makes them desirable for this purpose
39677 can you explain me what are the differences between the four following subjects analytical mechanics rational mechanics classical mechanics theoretical mechanics
39706 im familiar with the ideal gas law pv nrt but dont think it applies to liquids like water if im wrong please correct me if im right then what equation of state applies to liquids such as water
39732 always thought that even in darkness there would still be some light making complete darkness complete absence of photons as far as know just theoretical thing when tried looking up whether or not this view was actually correct didnt find any clear information however am wrong
40843 my somewhat basic understanding of the concept comes from lectures ive attended about the bohr model which explains the phenomenon as arising from the fact that certain configurations of an atom can only absorb certain wavelengths of light and other configurations can emit the same wavelength and change into the first configuration now what cannot understand is why these effects do not cancel out and why in some instances absorption wins out and we observe absorption lines and in other instances it is the other way around also if havent misunderstood there are also some instances where we observe both absorption and emission at once so my question boils down to this why
40886 felix baumgartner just completed his breathtaking free fall skydiving jump from text feet text km above the earth breaking the speed of sound during the process was wondering if the next step could be jumping from the international space station the person would have to overcome the orbital velocity of the station re enter the earths atmosphere and land on the earth with their feet assisted by parachute would such stunt be survivable by human could the person wear space suit like the one depicted in the movie sunshine is such space suit possible update came across an interesting news article about company that is working on skydiving suite that would survive freefall from outer space read more here
40894 so far synthetic elements have been synthesized all are unstable decaying with half lives between years and milliseconds why is that
40907 is it possible to derive ohms law perhaps in some appropriate limit from maxwells equations

40960 is there simple account of why technetium is unstable from the isotopes section of wikipedias article on technetium technetium with atomic number denoted is the lowest numbered element in the periodic table that is exclusively radioactive the second lightest exclusively radioactive element promethium has an atomic number of atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers even when the total number of nucleons protons neutrons are even odd numbered elements therefore have fewer stable isotopes it would seem that simply its atomic number is part of the reason why it is unstable though this just pushes back the mystery back one step for me why are nuclei with even atomic number more stable and why then are all of the elements from through stable notably including silver and iodine not to mention higher odd proton nuclei such as gold even the most stable isotope of technetium has half life less than hundredth that of uranium which has half life of 8ma the most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium with half life of million years ma technetium half life ma and technetium half life years technetium 99tc is major product of the fission of uranium 235u making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium its perhaps an unfair comparison as uranium has an even atomic number however that is suppose to help mitigate its instability but it also has nearly twice the number of protons this deepens the mystery for me even granted that tc has no stable isotopes how does it come to be so unstable that all of its isotopes are essentially absent naturally compared for instance to uranium this question is specific case of an earlier question on synthetic isotopes
40965 would like to demonstrate the several forms of the friedmann equations with the factors everything is fine apart that have missing factor somewhere in all the following rho is the mass density and not the energy density rho rho if we look at the wikipedia french page concerning the friedmann equations according to the demonstration of the last paragraph we have the einstein field equation mu nu frac pi mu nu the einstein tensor mu nu begin pmatrix ij ij ij end pmatrix the energy momentum tensor mu nu begin pmatrix ij ij ij end pmatrix with 3h frac ij left3 frac frac dot frac right rho ij but and ij have the same physical unit and rho are in kg whereas and ij does not have the same unit in the first one we have and in the second one we have frac for example my question are is there mistake in the french wikipedia demonstration where is the missing where can find good demonstration with the factors edit maybe ive found something at the beginning of the demonstration the author say that the metric is of the form ds 2dt gamma ij dx dx where gamma ij depends on the coordinates choice this formula seems ok to me but then he writes that ij gamma ij have doubt on is it equal to or to in fact if we choose to write then rho isnt it
40983 if total energy is conserved just transformed and never newly created is there sum of all energies that is constant why is it probably not that easy
40999 given the recent news about the discovery of an earthlike planet orbiting alpha centauri our nearest stellar neighbour it got me wondering just how fast would spaceship have to travel to be able to reach alpha centauri within persons lifetime say years the reasoning is that even if we sent an unmanned probe assuming that it would be one way trip the journey time would have to be sufficiently short to keep peoples interest in the mission so that when it actually arrived and sent back data there would be somebody home to receive the data the added complication is that the craft would have to slow down sufficiently so that it could at least enter orbit around the star im not going to suggest that it manages to orbit one of the planets suppose what im really interested in how this speed compares to the speeds weve managed to attain so far and thus get an idea of how much technology must advance for us to be able to even think of achieving this know about relativistic effects due to travelling at high percentage of the speed of light but im not really interested in that here
41030 in quantum mechanics why is int dp pi rangle langle where rangle represents momentum eigenstate
41065 this is perhaps naive question but why do we write down the lagrangian mathcal frac eta mu nu partial mu phi partial nu phi frac phi as the simplest lagrangian for real scalar field this is by no means obvious to me after all it gives rise to kinetic energy term fine some specific unmotivated potential energy less fine and gradient energy even less obvious is there some principle by which we know to study this lagrangian is it just that mathcal gives rise to nice equation the klein gordon equation which we can interpret in an appealing way this reason seems somehow hollow ive heard people mention causality as motivation but cant see how that ties in could someone provide me with some intuition many thanks in advance
41138 the action is defined as int dt where is lagrangian know that using euler lagrange equation all sorts of formula can be derived but remain unsure of the physical meaning of action
41180 ive been going through shankars principles of quantum mechanics in the section of the system of identical particles he uses an example of billiards to illustrate the difference between identical particles in classical vs quantum mechanics he argues that in classical mechanics we can track the history of particle billiard ball to distinguish it from another particle with no intrinsic differences in quantum mechanics however he argues since continual observation is not possible we cant use the same method to distinguish identical particles potential counter example thought was suppose we have two non interacting particles in same square well and at the end of some measurement we find that one particle is in stationary state psi and particle in psi we measure the system again after some time then we know whichever particle thats in psi must be particle from the previous measurement and the same goes for particle thus we can distinguish the two identical particles what conceptual mistakes am making here
41199 this paper was published in phys lett in and predicted the higgs mass to be gev based on the asymptotic safety of gravity is this prediction taken seriously by the theory community or is it considered only to be lucky guess edit thanks to heidar for this fantastic compilation of higgs mass predictions this makes the point that it was probably lucky guess but nonetheless it could still be interpreted as weak evidence
41254 in his science fiction novel ringworld author larry niven describes the eponymous ringworld gigantic structure shaped as ring with radius of around au rotating around star in the center of the ring this system is described as physically stable however many readers have complained that it is actually unstable and the structure will drift away in time my first thought reading this is that the ringworlds center of mass is identical to the stars center of mass so the system should be stable why is it unstable some additional details of the structure radius au mass solar mass year duration hours the ringworld is also made of material strong enough to withstand the stresses affecting it in such system

41352 if time is treated as fourth dimension of spacetime what is relation between length and time units or in other words how can convert time units to length units for instance seconds to meters
41373 im sure this question is bit gauche for this site but im just mathematician trying to piece together some physical intuition question is the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics still in any sense viable namely is it completely ridiculous to regard the theory as follows every system corresponds to hilbert space to each class of preparations of system corresponds to state functional and to every class of measurement procedure there is self adjoint operator and finally state functional evaluated at one of these self adjoint operators yields the expected value of numerical outcomes of measurements from the class of measurement procedures taken over the preparations represented by the state am aware of bells inequalities and the fact that the statistical interpretation can survive in the absence of locality and am aware of the recent work which establishes that the psi epistemic picture of quantum mechanics is inconsistent with quantum predictions so the quantum state must describe an actual underlying physical state and not just information about nature nevertheless would really like short summary of the state of the art with regard to the statistical interpretation of qm against the agnostic copenhagen interpretation of qm at present is the statistical interpretation dead and if it isnt where precisely does it stand an expert word on this from physicist would be very very much appreciated thanks in advance edit have changed the word mean to expected above and have linked to the papers that spurred this question note in particular that the basic thing in question here is whether the statistical properties prescribed by qm can be applied to an individual quantum state or necessarily to an ensemble of preparations as an outsider it seems silly to attach statistical properties to an individual state as is discussed in my first link does the physics community share this opinion edit emilio has further suggested that replace the word statistical by operational in this question feel free to answer this question with such substitution assumed please indicate that you have done this though
41399 im toying with an infrared thermometer one which you point onto an object press the button and it instantly measures the temperature by estimating the infrared radiation from the object it shows more or less the room temperature when point it to things in the room now open the window the temperature outside is degrees celsius point the thermometer to the ground it shows something near degrees when point it horizontally and directed onto building located several hundred meters away it shows something like degrees when point it onto the sky it shows an error message indicating that the measurement result is below zero celsius and it cant display it this doesnt make sense the ground has the same temperature as the air and theres thick layer of air above so wherever point the thermometer the temperature is more or less the same and so the infrared radiation intensity should be more or less the same yet the thermometer displays largely different results why does the infrared thermometer display much lower temperatures when directed to the outer air compared to when directed onto nearby solid objects
41444 my teacher and are in the middle of an argument because she says that if you were to drop two objects at the same time and the same height but with different initial velocities both of them would hit the ground at the same time she also said this was proven by galileos unregistered experiment when he let two objects fall from the leaning tower of pisa so told her that she was right they would fall at the same time only if both initial velocities had been the same and that galileos experiment was mainly to prove that mass has nothing to do with the timing registered on two objects falling from the same height could you please help me out using pure physics to prove my teacher wrong ive already searched the internet but havent found something that would convince her because its what already have explained to her but shes in denial and im thinking she just doesnt want to accept that shes wrong assume no drag air resistance

41544 the length contraction means that an object is the longest in the frame in which it is at rest lets assume have meter stick with length delta in my rest frame which is xct and want to know how long my meter stick seems to an observer moving with frame xct 1st draw world lines of meter stick in rest frame and they are vertical parallel to ct axis as meter stick is stationary in this frame 2nd if an observer in moving frame xct wants to measure my meter stick he measures its edges at the same moment in his time so draw tilted line parallel to axis 3rd if mesure the length delta which is length of meter stick as observer in frame xct sees it it seems to me that he sees longer distance than me this is not correct could anyone tell me what am missing here
41624 this is mostly for my own personal illumination and isnt directly related to any school or work projects just picked up trio of laser pointers red green and blue and notice that when project them the red and the blue appear to be dimmer to my eye than the green one had fleeting suspicion that perhaps this is an effect of blue and red being at the periphery of the visual light scale but honestly have no idea if this is the case or if its just my eyes playing tricks on me all three lasers have the same nominal strength in this case
41662 starting with the einstein hilbert lagrangian eh frac lambda one can formally calculate gravitational energy momentum tensor eh mu nu frac delta eh delta mu nu leading to eh mu nu mu nu lambda mu nu mu nu frac mu nu lambda mu nu but then in the paragraph below eq on page of this paper it is said that this quantity is not physical quantity and that it is well known that for the gravitational field no physical energy momentum tensor exists to me personally this fact is rather surprising than well known so can somebody explain to me mathematically and or intuitively why there is no energy momentum tensor for the gravitational field
41680 how can light be called electromagnetic if it doesnt appear to be electric nor magnetic if go out to the sunlight magnets arent affected or dont seem to be and there is no transfer of electric charge electrons as there is in ac dc current in space in particular the photons which light is supposed to be composed of have no electric charge nor do they have magnetic charge im looking for an explanation that can be appreciated by the average non physicist joe
41735 in the book playing with planets the author makes the following argument pertinent to flying robots of the future as it is an important law of physics says that smaller organisms fly much more easily than larger ones this can be seen clearly in living organisms small animals have lot less trouble getting off the ground than larger ones therefore once miniaturization sets in we can expect to see lots of small flying robots im familiar with the upper limit for size of birds but dont know if it can be expressed as simple law of physics versus complications with the feather replacement intervals on the other hand insects have some of the highest mass specific metabolisms of any animals on earth most peoples experience with rc helicopters is probably consistent with this the flight time is typically matter of minutes severely limiting its usability large aircraft can fly clear across the world for all of these reasons the idea scaling laws would be favorable to small flying robotic drones seem to violate intuition is there any truth to the idea that smaller flying machines would fly easier is there an argument that can be made with reynolds numbers tiny gnats can have reynolds numbers in the 100s would laminar conditions set lower limit on flight how does scale affect the specific energy consumption needs of flying machines
41738 in the brst formalism of gauge theories the lautrup nakanishi field ax appears as an auxiliary variable mathcal text brst frac mu nu mu nu frac xi partial mu mu partial mu bar eta ad mu eta and in the superfield formalism of susy the field fx also appears as an auxiliary variable mathcal text susy partial mu phi partial mu phi bar psi dagger bar sigma mu partial mu psi ldots it is very tempting to view ax and as lagrange multipliers since their equations of motion leads to constraints but these variables do not enter into the lagrangian linearly like conventional lagrange multiplier rather they enter into the lagrangian quadratically however in kugo and ojimas paper manifestly covariant canonical formulation of the yang mills field theores they refer to the ax fields as the lagrange multiplier fields so my question is can these auxiliary fields be viewed as lagrange multipliers and in what ways do they behave differently similar to the conventional lagrange multipliers that enter into the function linearly

43060 am an absolute neophyte regarding physics what are the challenges to achieving cold fusion im not sure this is duplicate of why is cold fusion considered bogus because that question is talking largely about the validity of some claims of cold fusion being realized this question is specifically asking about the challenges of cold fusion and how they may be addressed in the emerging study of low energy nuclear reactions
43068 learned about the coronal discharge and the common explanation is because the electric field is strong where radius of curvature is small but havent found anything yet that explains why electrons like to crowd at the peaks and and escape from the holes my intuition suggests electrons try to distribute on the surface as uniform as they can but they dont why
43069 have started to study quantum mechanics know linear algebrafunctional analysis calculus and so on but at this moment have problem in dirac bra ket formalism namely have problem with translation from ordinary linear algebra language to this formalism for better understanding of the problem ill give some definitions which use assume that mid rangle is vector in hilbert vector space bra langle mid is vector of dual vector space left langle mid longrightarrow right defined by langle mid rangle left mid rangle mid rangle right where times longrightarrow is metric on is linear operator on consider bilinear form quad leftfx right fx in this notation we can define adjoint operator on fax fx tried to understand two following equations there is expression langle mid mid rangle in my text book was written the following phrase operator acts on ket from the left and on bra on the right but according to the difenitions that use adjoint operator acts on but in this case operator acts on dont absolutely get it one possible solution which see is that this is just notation of the next thing langle mid mid rangle vau vu langle mid rangle quad langle mid langle mid the second way is to use isomorphism between and and then operator is able to act on and dual correspondence the third way is that we use matrix representation everywhere and in expression langle mid mid rangle we multiply row on matrix of operator on column then this expression absolutely clear because the multiplication of matrixs is associative the same difficulties have with expression mid rangle langle mid dagger could you explain it to would be happy if you will say which way is right and if all of my suggestions are wrong please tell me the right one
43175 im not familiar yet on how information theory can be emerged used in qm qft but was thinking about this question while we have heisenberg uncertainty principle on measuring coupled observables can we express it using somehow more fundamental abstract concept like information uncertainty especially that we have information conservation principle like for energy and momentum and associated symmetry cpt in sense that because there is always some details that we cant measure know can we express that as some information uncertainty and despite of the answer please explain why there is or there isnt connection relation between the two concepts
43195 my science teacher is always saying the words weight of an object and mass of an object but then my physics book that read on my own tells me completely different definitions from the way these words are used in my science class so which is right what is the difference between the weight of an object and the mass of an object

43293 so know the basic gist is that fusion powers main issue is sustaining the fusion also know that there are two methods the torus method and the laser method the torus magnetically contains plasma and heats it with radiation and accelerates the plasma around to make strong enough collisions that protons fuse the laser method uses lasers and focuses it on tiny frozen hydrogen pellets and aims to initiate fusion each time pellets are dropped the though struck me when we could sorta combine the two designs together the torus doesnt have to worry about making fusion happen at specific location but it has issues in that the plasma is unevenly heated and leaks on the other hand the laser design is extremely complicated in the level of precision needed and would have to repeat this for every pellet this lead me to think to make something precise and contained at the same time see that particle colliders are able to direct two beams of protons and have them collide at specific spot with very precise energy couldnt we tune the energy of the two beams of protons to the energy required for them to fuse we have the ability to smash them into bits surely we have the ability to have them fuse im thinking about the type of collider that circles two beams in opposite directions it would be at much lower energies than normal colliders and would be very precise and it would be possible to fuse at specific location that has greater leeway because for protons that missed collision theyd just circle around again thus protons would efficiently be used and very little would be wasted there wouldnt be problems of plasma leakage because we are focusing them in thin tight beam it seems that this idea has girth or feel this way at least can someone back me up by offering some calculations on how to calculate the efficiency how would go about calculating the two circling beams of protons and at what specific velocity would be needed etc

43714 consider theory of one complex scalar field with the following lagrangian mathcal partial mu phi partial mu phi mu phi phi frac lambda phi phi the potential is phi mu phi frac lambda phi the classic stable minimum of this potential is given by phi frac mu sqrt lambda theta for any theta in mathbb we then define new field psi phi rewrite the lagrangian in terms of the new field psi et voil out pops the mass term lambda psi psi people usually explain that this shows the existence of field whose quanta are particles of mass sqrt lambda in this sense the original field phi has acquired mass dont buy it dont see where this argument has actually used the fact that is the vacuum expectation value of the field yes it is natural to expand about the classical minima but why not do something stupid instead and define new field psi phi once again after rewriting the lagrangian in terms of the new field you should find that it has indeed acquired has mass term playing this trick over and over by picking number different than you should be able to find mass term with any mass you like obviously this doesnt make any physical sense there is something special about the substitution psi phi there must be more to it than tedious algebraic manipulation but what is it why does nature possess particles of the mass that this substitution yields as opposed to any other substitution on another note what exactly does this have to do with the global u1 symmetry present it seems that the only thing that has played role so far is that the vacuum expectation value of the field is non zero but yet ive always seen this mass generation presented alongside symmetry breaking what precisely is the relationship between the two
43722 when eat hot pizza or melted cheese sandwich the cheese feels lot hotter than the crust or bread in particular the cheese might scald the roof of my mouth but the crust will not is this my imagination or because the crust cools little faster than the cheese so has already cooled bit by the time eat it or because the cheese cools little faster than the crust so transfers heat to the roof of my mouth bit more or what
43768 understand that air friction cools off an object at low speeds for example if you blow on spoon of hot soup it cools off or if you swing hot frying pan in the air it cools off faster but at higher speeds the situation changes in the opposite for example consider meteor falling on earth it is so fast that it heats up to such high temperature that it burns into ashes what is the critical speed in which an object starts to heat up for example consider spherical object with radius of meter let its density be cm3 if needed and let the air pressure be atm assume that the temperature of the object is and the temperature of the air is also assume that the specific heat constant of the material is cal gr what is the critical speed for this object after which its temperature starts to rise above
43782 when we have resistors in series the current through all the resistors is same and the voltage drop or simply voltage at each resistor is different question it is fine that voltage drop potential drop across each resistor is different because each resistor offers different resistance suppose but how is the current through each resistor same if we have resistors of different resistance shouldnt the current be different through each resistor similarly when we have resistors in parallel the current through each resistor is different but the voltage drop at each resistor is same question current through each resistor is different because resistance of each resistor is different suppose but how is the voltage drop across each resistor same here shouldnt the voltage drop at each resistor be different because each resistor offers different resistance

43833 ive been asking myself question for quite some time say that bullet gets out of gun at km im european hence the metric system say train could go in straight line at km say youre at the back of that train and youd shoot bullet backwards the bullet exits your gun at 900km and flies away from the train at the same speed however what would happen for an earth observer youll agree that if you shoot in an open field the bullet will stay at the same altitude for several seconds before falling to the ground with field large enough so from that train same thing applies so for the earth observer the bullet will not have an horizontal speed and will stay at the same altitude for several seconds before falling to the ground so basically itll float up in the air without falling thatd be strange for the earth observer right but the horizontal speed will decrease of course so for the earth observer the bullet will for few seconds stay still at the same position and then after several seconds will start to fall down little bit and will start to move towards the train because its horizontal speed towards the train will decrease strange again ok last one what would happen if the earth observer tried to catch the bullet with his bare hands nothing right just maybe very hot bullet because of the explosion but itd be basically as easy to catch as stone floating up in the air and dont tell me that the bullet will slow down due to air friction because remember the bullet is not moving or very slowly
43853 have been wondering about the axiom of choice and how it relates to physics in particular was wondering how many if any experimentally verified physical theories require the axiom of choice or well ordering and if any theories actually require constructability as math student have always been told the axiom of choice is invoked because of the beautiful results that transpire from its assumption do any mainstream physical theories require aoc or constructability if so how do they require aoc or constructability
43859 first thing ive been wondering is how the gravitational field is emitted matter emits gravitational waves and guess that those waves travel at around the speed of light if thats not the case please direct me to something that explains that for now ill assume that this emits waves that travels at the speed of light now those waves are emitted constantly without the apparent need of energy just the mass being there is enough to emit those waves and the mass itself isnt consumed by the emission of gravitational waves again thats my assumption please tell me if im wrong now if we would be able to modulate the mass of an object we would be able to modulate the gravitational waves this object emits hence we would be able to transmit information through those waves if of course wed have device that detects gravitational waves with enough sensitivity those waves would be transmitted at no cost because the waves are emitted by the mass the only cost of this transmission would be the mass modulator which has yet to be invented and which would require energy however the actual transmission doesnt require energy and the gravitational waves are harmless unlike the em ones so here comes my question as in the title would it be possible somehow to use the gravitational waves to transmit information

44087 my understanding is that an arbitrary quantum mechanical wavefunction can be written as linear combination of eigenfunctions of some hermitian operator most commonly the hamiltonian when measurement corresponding to that operator is made on this superposition state the wavefunction collapses and only specific values are observed namely the eigenvalues of the particular eigenstates that comprised the wavefunction moreover the probability of measuring the eigenvalue is proportional to the square of the coefficient of that eigenstate in the linear combination etc and yet in many situations it seems to be assumed that the system is already in an eigenstate and that superposition is not possible for example the electron in the hydrogen atom is said to be in the 1s state or the 2s state but never superposition of the two the possible angular momentum vectors for qm rigid rotor with fixed are sometimes drawn as discrete cones but couldnt the average bf point in any direction since rigid rotor might be in superposition of states when deriving boltzmann statistics we consider how to place particles into the level with energy epsilon but there is no consideration that particle might occupy two or more energy levels simultaneously why do we ignore superposition in these and similar cases
44139 conness noncommutative geometry program includes an approach to the standard model that employs noncommutative extension of riemannian metric in recent years ive heard physicists say that this approach does not hold significant interest in the physics community is this in fact the case if so why do not mean for this question to be argumentative but instead would like clarification
44196 am student studying mathematics with no prior knowledge of physics whatsoever except for very simple equations would like to ask due to my experience with mathematics is there set of axioms to which it adheres in mathematics we have given sets of axioms and we build up equations from these sets how does one come up with seemingly simple equations that describe physical processes in nature mean its not like you can see an apple falling and intuitively come up with an equation for motion is there something to build up hypotheses from and how are they proven if the only way of verifying the truth is to do it experimentally is physics rigorous
44232 according to bbc report astronomers have spotted rogue planet wandering the cosmos without star to orbit light years away the proximity of the new rogue planet has allowed astronomers to guess its age comparatively young million years old one tricky part is determining if rogue planet candidates are as massive as the failed stars known as brown dwarfs further along in stellar evolution but without enough mass to spark the nuclear fusion that causes starlight the team believe it has temperature of about 400c and mass between four and seven times that of jupiter well short of the mass limit that would make it likely brown dwarf is this heat residual heat from the planets formation million years ago if not what is the process that sustains this temperature in the absence of nearby star
44247 its summer day and the air in my house has been heated up could switch on my air conditioning but then id be using energy from the grid in order to reduce the amount of energy in my house what id much rather do is capture the heat energy from the air so cooling it down and turn that heat energy into electricity so could store it in battery or sell it to the grid or use some other means of disposing of it is such an apperatus possible within our present understand of nature why or why not presume not as people would be selling kits just to pre empt possible answer ive seen similar conversations in the past and inefficient has been given as the answer as to why not dont understand this as an objection because the heat energy is effectively free the sun rudely went and gave me an excessive amount of heat energy without being asked to is converting heat to electricity really so ineffiecient that id be better off running air conditioning

44284 how does the size of humans compare to the size of other objects in the universe are we among the relatively large or the relatively small things my very preliminary research suggests that the smallest thing in the physical universe is the quantum foam which should be about planck length or while the universe is about this would seem to bias us toward the big side by about orders of magnitude am skeptical of this estimate because it is pretty close to the middle of the scale and am always skeptical of measures that put humans in the center so is there another way of thinking about quantifying this question edit it seems that the smallest thing we have actual evidence of is neutrino which is which would put us even closer to the center

44576 integrable systems are systems which have 2n time independent functionally independent conserved quantities being the number of degrees of freedom or whose poisson brackets with each other are zero the way understand it these conditions correspond directly to us being able to do the hamilton jacobi transformation which is roughly equivalent to saying that the 2n conserved quantities are the initial conditions of the problem which itself is way of saying that the map from the phase space position at some time to that at time is invertible but if the last statement is right why are there systems which are non integrable at all shouldnt all systems trajectories be uniquely determined by the equations of motion and initial conditions or is it that all non integrable systems are those whose lagrangians cant be written non holonomic constraints friction etc ive heard that poincare proved that the gravitational three body problem in two dimensions was non integrable but he showed that there were too few analytic conserved quantities dont know why exactly that means non integrability so if someone could help me there that would be great too

44628 ok so remember reading that every conservation law has corresponding symmetry conservation of momentum is translational symmetry conservation of angular momentum is rotational symmetry now conservation of energy is temporal symmetry you can rewind the tape and it looks exactly the same but in reverse you dont get different movie running the tape in reverse but just saw an article here http arstechnica com science finding direction of time in exotic particle transformations where researchers found violations of time reversal symmetry now wouldnt that therefore mean that they found processes that create or destroy energy does symmetry violation mean that energy is not being conserved

44712 you can have two electrons that experience each others force by the exchange of photons the electromagnetic force yet if you compress them really strongly the electromagnetic interaction will no longer be the main force pushing them apart to balance the force that pushes them towards each other instead you get repulsive force as consequence of the pauli exclusion principle as have read so far this seems like force that is completely separate from the other well known forces like the strong electroweak and gravitational interaction even though the graviton hasnt been observed so far so my question is is pauli repulsion phenomenon that has also not yet been explained in terms of any of the three other forces that we know of note does this apply to degenerate pressure too which was explained to me as delta increasing because delta became smaller because the particles are confined to smaller space heisenberg as is what happens when stars collapse

44934 or does it exist mathematically is it really inconsistent with common sense mathematics or known physical laws as far as understand if it exists it must be far away from the positive matter because of repelling force so it explains why there is no observations of such matter it would be also very consistent with the idea that the total energy of the universe is zero doesnt it imply that the total mass of the universe is zero can you please clarify the statements below that seem to contradict each other all structures that exist mathematically exist also physically max tegmark despite being completely inconsistent with common sense approach and the expected behavior of normal matter negative mass is completely mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or energy such matter would violate one or more energy conditions and show some strange properties stemming from the ambiguity as to whether attraction should refer to force or the oppositely oriented acceleration for negative mass
44947 all lorentz observers watching particle move will compute the same value for the quantity ds dt dx dy dz ds mu nu dx mu dx nu and ds is then an infinitesimal proper time for point particle not subject to external forces one undergoing inertial motion the relativistic action is oc int ds remark an edit to the comment we can write lagrangian for relativistic particle which will be valid even if the particle is traveling close to the speed of light to preserve lorentz invariance the action should only depend upon quantities that are the same for all lorentz observers
44990 assuming we have sufficiently small and massive object such that its escape velocity is greater than the speed of light isnt this black hole it has an event horizon that light cannot escape time freezes at this event horizon etc however this object is not singularity if large stars mass were compressed to the size of say proton it would certainly have these properties but it would still not be singularity as proton does have volume the reason physics breaks down at singularities is because we cannot divide by zero but as long as the proton sized object has volume physics wont break down yet we still have an event horizon and an object that is invisible but not undetectable from the outside have read the answers to this related question im not sure if they dont address my specific question or if dont understand the answers

45578 was watching youtube video the other day where an economist said that he challenged his physics professor on this question back when he was in school his professor said each scenario is the same while he said that they are different and he said he supplied proof showing otherwise he didnt say whether or not the cars are the same mass but assumed they were to state it more clearly in the first instance each car is traveling at 50mph in the opposite direction and they collide with each other in the second scenario car travels at mph and crashes into brick wall which one is worse when first heard it thought of course theyre the same but then took step back and thought about it again it seems like in the first scenario the total energy of the system is the ke of the two cars or frac mv frac mv mv in the second scenario its the ke of the car plus wall which is frac m2v 2mv so the car crashing into the wall has to absorb and dissipate via heat twice as much energy so crashing into the wall is in fact worse is this correct to clarify im not concerned with the difference between wall and car and dont think thats what the question is getting at imagine instead that in the second scenario car is crashing at 100mph into the same car sitting there at 0mph with its brakes on of course first scenario is the same two of the same cars going 50mph in opposite directions collide are those two situations identical ps this scenario is also covered in an episode of mythbusters

45644 it is generally assumed that there is no limit on how many bosons are allowed to occupy the same quantum mechanical state however almost every boson encountered in every day physics is not fundamental particle with the photon being the most prominent exception they are instead composed of number of fermions which can not occupy the same state is it possible for more than one of these composite bosons to be in the same state even though their constituents are not allowed to be in the same state if the answer is yes how does this not contradict the more fundamental viewpoint considering fermions
45653 ive got rather humiliating question considering newtons third law if an object exterts force on object then object exerts an equal but opposite force on object considering that why is there motion at all should not all forces even themselves out so nothing moves at all when push table using my finger the table applies the same force onto my finger like my finger does on the table just with an opposing direction nothing happens except that feel the opposing force but why can push box on table by applying force ma on one side obviously outbalancing the force the box has on my finger and at the same time outbalancing the friction the box has on the table obviously have the greater mass and acceleration as for example the matchbox on the table and thusly can move it but shouldnt the third law prevent that from even happening shouldnt the matchbox just accommodate to said force and applying same force to me in opposing direction ive found lot of answers considering that question but none was satisfying to an extend that had an epiphany solving my fundamental problem ive got understanding it

45759 my girlfriend and were watching cosmos and something carl sagan said got us wondering what the farthest away visible star is obviously visible to the naked eye is fuzzy concept that might have many defensible answers but hopefully not too many to make the question little more interesting lets restrict to individually distinguishable stars otherwise the answer is pretty clearly some local group galaxy and there arent many of them to check the closest thing to reasonable answer we came up with was this wikipedia list of stars that are more luminous than any closer star the farthest away star on that list with plausibly visible apparent magnitude is eta carinae ly away magnitude however there are several reasons why im not willing to consider this definitively answered its wikipedia article and poorly sourced one at that so dont entirely trust it it sorts stars by bolometric luminosity rather than visual luminosity so perhaps theres some farther away star whose spectrum is better centered in the visible range the farthest away visible star isnt actually guaranteed to be on list of that sort even assuming the other two points are cleared up perhaps the farthest away visible star is only barely visible and theres some star both closer and absolutely brighter than it which makes the list given all these points is it actually the case that eta carinae is the farthest away visible star or is there some visible star thats farther from us

46240 in randall knight textbook physics for scientists and engineers in the first chapter on thermodynamics ch macroscopic description of matter one of the first conceptual questions is stated like so the sample in an experiment is initially at if the sample temperature is doubled what is the new temperature in the answer to that implies the reference to absolute temperature for simplicity to one significant figure as the book required 2k understand that the whole idea of this question to reiterate to the pupil that we ought to think of temperature as specific physical property and not in an everyday sense but am confused about the wording in the section on temperature author writes we will begin with the commonsense idea that temperature is measure of how hot or cold system is these are properties that we can judge without needing an elaborate theory as we develop these ieas we ll find that temperature is related to system thermal energy we ll study temperature more carefully in chapter and replace these vague notions of hot and cold with precise relationship between temperature and thermal energy that is as yet we are still at the stage of vague notions few paragraphs later knight introduces kelvin scale but nowhere there or in between does he specifically insists on that idea mentioned after the formula at least not that can see am missing something that should be obvious to me and fail to grasp it instantly because my brain is depleted by hours week of studies am just plain stupid because to my eternal shame it took me way too long to figure it out or was there better way to home onto that idea by an author what do other textbooks say on that topic how do they word this concept is the question logically flawed or confusing or is it the common way of describing the situation in scientific literature

46267 two open car trains approach each other at fixed velocities each has radar to see how quickly the other train is approaching but apart from that the trains have no priori knowledge of each other each train has engineers on its first and last cars each engineer has an atomic clock and laser for communicating with their partner on the same train long before the trains meet the engineers on each train use their lasers to adjust their relative separations to exactly one kilometer using the synchronization procedure first defined by einstein the engineers also exchange time data and use it to adjust their atomic clocks until they are precisely synchronized within their shared frame the trains meet the clocks are positioned so that they almost touch as they pass at the moment of nearest contact they exchange and record each others values timestamps some time later the clocks on the trailing cars meet and perform the same procedure the delay between the leading and trailing data events can now be measured in two ways if the two timestamps taken from the first train are compared the result is the time between the events as measured from the first train this value is meaningful because the engineers on that train previously synchronized their clocks and stayed within the same frame of reference at all times if the timestamps from the second train are used similar but distinct measurement of the time between the two events can be obtained now three questions is there anything wrong or impossible with this experimental setup if so what is it if you accept the experiment as realistic and meaningful will the delays calculated from the perspective of each of the two trains be the same or different if you answered different what is the correct procedure for predicting in advance what the ratio of the two delays will be the answers awarded the bounty to frankh for pages of excellent and educational work worth of reading by anyone who wants to understand special relativity better however ive also taken the unusual step of re allocating the answer designation to matthewmcirvin there are two reasons matthew mcirvin was the first one to spot the importance of the symmetric velocities frame which others ended up gravitating heh to and matthews answer is short which is great for readers in hurry frankh sorry about the switch but didnt realize could split them before so if you are not overly familiar with special relativity and want to understand the full range of issues definitely recommend frankhs answer but if you already know sr pretty well and want the key insights quickly please look at matthew mcirvins answer will have more proximate data exchange sr questions sometime in the near future two frames turns out to be very special case but had to start somewhere for folks with strong minds stout hearts and plenty of time to kill much more precise version of the above question is provided below it requires new notations alas to reduce the growing size of this question have deleted all earlier versions of it you can still find them in the change history precise version of the clock conundrum please see the first three figures below they define two new operators the frame view and clock synchronization operators that make the problem easier to state precisely note that the four timestamps a1 b1 a2 b2 ab that is the four timestamps are shared and agreed to with an accuracy of about nanosecond in this case by observers from both of the interacting frames or since t1 and t2 are historically recorded local events this assertion can be further generalized to t1t2 where represents all possible frames and yes is two eyes looking left while is two eyes looking to the right using the four shared time stamps define delta a2 a1 delta b2 b1 my main question is this assuming that delta ft delta exists what is fx analysis why this problem is difficult based purely on symmetry in the setup the most obvious answer is fx that is delta delta there are some interesting reasons to be troubled by that seemingly straightforward and even obvious conclusion not the least of which is that it violates the whole concept of special relativity the dingle heresy that is if you assume fx and follow that line of logic through to its logical conclusion you quickly end up with time that flows the same for all frames that is no relativity such conclusion is in flat violation of over century of very detailed experimental evidence and so is just not supportable the following four figures show why its so hard to assert that delta delta without violating special relativity while the above figures accurately capture the reality of relativistic contraction of both distance and time the problem in this case is simple how do you decide which frame to select the experiment as described can only give one outcome which one will it be

46292 how to easily using standard diy equipment measure the strength of magnetic field generated by permanent magnet narrowing down the loose language of the above strength of magnetic field either flux density at given point relative to the magnet or magnetic flux over area enclosed by loop made of wire whichever will be easier to measure either of those is fine standard diy equipment commonly found household items rudimentary tinkering tools soldering tools multimeter simple electronic parts or maybe an easy to make spring based dynamometer anything of this class of complexity the distance of measurement is such that the field is easily noticeable through simplest methods another magnet held in hand exerts perceptible force distance of maybe 5cm away at most the measurement doesnt need to be very accurate error of order of is quite acceptable simplicity is preferred over accuracy rationale trying to estimate what coil need to generate sufficient amount of power to light led with frictionless generator based on that magnet knowing speed of movement of the magnet and location of the coil relative to the path of the magnet if you know other simple methods of doing that without need for measuring the field they are most welcome them too
46318 just had this idea of orbiting planet just by jumping and then flying upon it on its orbit kind of like superman so would it be theoretically possible or is there chance of that small body to be remain its unity
46324 in quantum mechanics we know that change of frame gauge transform leaves the probability of an outcome measurement invariant well the square modulus of the wave function the probability because it is just multiplication by phase term was wondering about general relativity is there something left invariant by change of frame of course energy momentum are invariants of lorentz transform but these are special relativity examples guess there is something else more intrinsic and related to the mathematical structure of the theory like space time interval or something ive tried looking at the landau book on field theory but it is too dense for me to have quick answer to this question have bad understanding about gr apologize for that im trying to understand to which respect one calls the gr theory gauge theory for me gauge transform leaves something invariant best regards edit thanks to the first answers think should refine my question and first ask this to which extent is general relativity gauge theory if you have good references to this topic that would be greatthe wikipedia pages are obscure for me for the moment thanks in advance best regards
46332 know that most elliptic orbits precess due to the math of general relativity like this source http en wikipedia org wiki two body problem in general relativity also know that something is different for orbits at radii below certain value wikipedia explains this as follows im confused by this and just want to ask for clarification if the particle slips slightly inwards from inner where all three forces are in balance the third force dominates the other two and draws the particle inexorably inwards to what does this mean if you drew graph of the path particle takes in this unstable regime what would it look like why is the stability transition point further than the schwarzschild radius why does this graph show an unstable point beyond the schwarzschild radius for elliptical orbits that come very close to the event horizon is there some kind of orbital decay how is energy conserved in short do all orbits with gr effects look like the precession shown above or is there another shape that we see if it gets closer to the schwarzschild radius
46353 first of all let me tell you that im not physicist but rather computer scientist with mere interest in physics at nowhere near professional level so feel free to close this question if it doesnt make any sense remember physicist friend mentioning me about an argument about the finiteness of the universe have looked it up and it turned out to be olbers paradox we computer scientist like to use astronomical numbers to help us imagine the complexity of an algorithm one of the most common one is the number of atoms in the observable universe which we take as so have crude understanding about the observable universe concept had known these two for some time hence woke up with the dilemma today so my question is how come it can be argued that universe is finite just because it is dark if we know that we can only observe finite portion of it cant it be the case that the universe is infinite even if the sky is dark because not all the light from all the stars reach the earth have searched this little bit but think need an explanation in simpler terms like popular physics historical perspective would also be welcomed
46380 saw it in this pdf where they state that dagger and thus is hermitian find this notation confusing because an operator is hermitian if langle psi psi rangle langle psi psi rangle left langle psi psi rangle right dagger or more elaborately int dagger psi dagger psi dv int psi dagger psi dv or in another way left right being expectation value here to avoid confusion left right left right dagger but surely this does not imply dagger look at the momentum operator vec hbar nabla but vec neq vec dagger is it just sloppy notation and are they talking about expectation values or are hermitian operators actually operators that are equal to their hermitian conjugate my qm course that ive been taught would state otherwise let me try to illustrate this with another 1d example langle psi psi rangle int psi dagger hbar frac partial partial psi dx psi dagger psi infty infty hbar int psi frac partial psi dagger partial dx int psi hbar frac partial psi partial dagger dx int hbar frac partial partial dagger psi dagger psi dx langle psi psi rangle now this shows that the expectation values might be the same but the operator between the parentheses itself is different in the first and last expression look at the parentheses dagger as whole think the reason why am confused is because dont understand how dagger works on something that is not matrix if that is even possible
46520 this may be naive question but after the fukushima daiichi partial meltdown and studying the aftermath of chernobyl it seems they could be helped by this idea in chernobyl the liquidators that cleaned up the disaster tunneled concrete under the reactor core and covered the whole complex in big containment unit why could they not have meter pit below reactor filled with water with trap door holding the reactor up this pit could be very thick reinforced concrete similar to missile silo if there were meltdown or imminent meltdown and there were no other options the reactor core could be dropped into this pit by triggering the trap door and then perhaps have lead shot dumped on it or sealed in concrete this seems very simple but there must be some reason why this is not practical know that the core would still be hot and it would still be problem but would this not be better than it being exposed to air

46573 this is follow up to an intriguing question last year about tension in string theory what are the strings in string theory composed of am serious strings made of matter are complex objects that require highly specific form of long chain inter atomic bonding mostly carbon based that would be difficult to implement if the physics parameters of our universe were tweaked even tiny bit that bonding gets even more complicated when you add in elasticity the vibration modes of real string are the non obvious emergent outcome of complex interplay of mass angular momentum various conservation laws and convenient linearities inherent in of our form of spacetime in short matter based vibrating real string is the outcome of the interplay of most of the more important physics rules of our universe its composition what is is made of is particularly complex real strings are composed out of statistically unlikely form of long chain bonding which in turn depend on the rather unlikely properties that emerge from highly complex multiparticle entities called atoms so how does string theory handle all of this what are the strings in string theory made of and what is it about this substance that makes string theories simple in comparison to the emergent and non obvious complexities required to produce string like vibrations in real matter based strings addendum all new as of ok im trying to go back to my original question after some apt complaints that my addendum yesterday had morphed it into an entirely new question but dont want to trash the great responses that addendum produced so im trying to walk the razors edge by creating an entirely new addendum that hope expands on the intent of my question without changing it in any fundamental way here goes the simplest answer to my question is that strings are pure mathematical abstractions and so need no further explanation all of the initial answers were variants of that answer truly did not expect that to happen while such answers are sincere and certainly well intended suspect that most people reading my original question will find them bit disappointing and almost certainly not terribly insightful they will be hoping for more and heres why while most of modern mathematical physics arguably is derived from materials analogies early wave analogies tended towards placing waves within homogeneous and isotropic water like or air like media the aether of the late 1800s over time and with no small amount of insight these early analogies were transformed into sets of equations that increasingly removed the need for physical media analogies the history of maxwells equations and then sr is gorgeous example that one nicely demonstrates the remarkable progress of the associated physics theories away from using physical media and towards more universal mathematical constructs in those cases understand immediately why the outcomes are considered fundamental after all they started out with clunky material science analogies and then managed over time to strip away the encumbering analogies leaving for us shiny little nuggets of pure math that to this day are gorgeous to behold now in the more recent case of string theory heres where think the rub is for most of us who are not immersed in it on daily basis the very word string invokes the image of vibrating entity that is good deal more complicated and specific than some isotropic wave medium for one thing the word string invokes perhaps incorrectly an image of an object localized in space that is the vibrations are taking place not within some isotropic field located throughout space but within some entity located in some very specific region of space strings in string theory also seem to possess rather complicated and certainly non trivial suite materials like properties such as length rigidity tension and im sure others some analog of angular momentum so again trying to keep to my original question can someone explain what string in string theory is made of in way that provides some insight into why such an unusually object like medium of vibration was selected as the basis for building all of the surrounding mathematics of string theory from one excellent comment you know who you are can even give an example of the kind of answer was hoping for paraphrasing the comment was this strings vibrate in ways that are immediately reminiscent of the harmonic oscillators that have proven so useful analytically in wave and quantum theory now like that style of answer lot for one thing anyone who has read feynmans section on such oscillators in his lectures will immediately get the idea based on that my own understanding of the origins of strings has now shifted to something far more specific and connectable to historical physics which is this making tuning forks smaller and smaller has been been shown repeatedly in the history of physics to provide an exceptionally powerful analytical method for analyzing how various types of vibrations propagate and interact so why not take this idea to the logical limit and make space itself into what amounts to huge field of very small tuning fork like harmonic oscillators now that can at least understand as an argument for why strings resonated well with lot of physicists as an interesting approach to unifying physics addendum the answer no kidding this year for the first time submitted an essay fundamental as fewer bits to the annual fqxi foundational questions essay contest in the essay propose that kolmogorov complexity provides more automated way less human biased way to apply occams razor to physics theories literally by trying to find the least bits representation of the kolmogorov sense of program like data compression my thanks to garrett lisi for noticing the connection to occams razor had not thought of my essay that way the contest which this year goes on until may proved to be much more interesting and interactive than had anticipated in the course of looking at other essays dove into the details of how string theory originated was amazed to find out that the concept has some very solid experimental data behind it at scale about times larger than the one at which it is now described as it turns out string theory originated in some extremely interesting 1960s and 1970s experimental research on hadrons hadron is any particle composed of quarks and includes both two quark bosonic mesons and three quark fermionic baryons such as protons neutrons and the more exotic lambda particles being composed of quarks all hadrons are of course bound together by the strong force and therein likes the real experimentally meaningful answer to what the questions of what strings are composed of all real experimentally meaningful strings are composed of the strong force it seems that most perhaps all hadrons have excited states in which their spins are augmented in increments of for example both the proton and neutron normally has spin of frac but both also have higher spins states of frac frac and frac frac these higher spins states also have higher masses amazingly when all the possible states are plotted in spin versus mass squared graph the result is beautiful set of straight lines with even spacing between the spin additions these lovely and highly unexpected lines are called regge trajectories and they are the true origins of string theory theoretical analyses of these remarkable regularities could be explained by assuming them to be the stationary vibration modes of string in fact if you think in terms of how skip rope can have one two or even more loops in it when handled by an expert you are not too far off the mark at the time there was hope that these remarkable string like vibration models might lead to deeper understanding of both fundamental and composite particles however quantum chromodynamics qcd instead began to dominate while regge trajectories continued to pose theoretical problems it looked like the end for hadron level strings and string vibrations despite the truly remarkable and still unexplained regularities seen in regge trajectories then something very strange happened an event that to my way of thinking was one of the least rational and most bizarre events in the entire history of physics call it the deep dive it has features that would more typically associate with the ancient and fascinating history of religious revelation and the founding of new religions than would with scientific analysis while they were not the only people involved in physicists scherk and schwarz wrote conventional looking paper dual models for non hadrons with an extremely unconventional conclusion tucked away inside the conclusion was this because the two spin increments of hadron strings bore several mathematical resemblances to the proposed properties of spin gravitons the still hypothetical quantized particles of gravity they were in some way one and the same thing and the concept of string vibrations should therefore be moved from out of hadrons and into the domain of quantum gravity this enormous leap of faith was the origin of what we now call string theory there was of course tiny problem in the most literal since of the word this abrupt leap from very real experimentally meaningful string like vibration modes in hadrons to gravitons plunged the needed size scales down to the experimentally inaccessible planck foam level this was drop of about orders of magnitude with comparable increase in the energy levels needed to access the proposed vibrations even worse all of the severe constraints on vibration modes imposed by hadron architectures were instantly removed by this proposed drop allowing the number of vibration modes of the now abstract strings composed of now abstract substance maybe mass energy to explode into at least possibile vacuum states explore all of this bit more actually hmm less than just did here in mini essay attached to my fqxi essay discussion in that mini essay argue that its time to get back to real string theory that is there remains to this day very real and extraordinarily interesting data puzzle in the very existence of regge trajectories this is mystery that still needs to be resolved this data is another example of how spin is remarkably deep and fundamental concept one for which physics still seems to be missing some kind of critical piece or pieces regarding the question what are the strings in string theory made of the answer could not be any clearer in the real experimentally meaningful strings found back in hadron research in the 1960s and 1970s they are function of the strong force constrained in interesting and limiting ways by the quarks that enable string like topology to exist in the first place this is all very real very meaningful physics for the planck level strings that were proposed essentially by revelation that is by leap of faith from experimentally meaningful physics down orders of magnitude to the inaccessible level of the planck foam based on no more than superficial mathematical resemblance and with utter abandonment of any of the original tight constraints on both substance the strong force and vibration modes the topologies of mesons and baryons the epistemological nature of the deep dive now also allows me to provide more logically precise and self consistent answer the substance of which planck level strings are composed is exactly the same as the substance that angels use to bind themselves to each other while dancing on the head of pin if you think thats an unfair comparison for scientific discussion no problem just state exactly what scientific experiment should be performed to prove that planck scale strings are not composed of the same substance that angels use bind themselves to each other while dancing on the head of pin if string theory is truly science and if the half billion dollars of critically important research funding that has been spent on it over four decades has not been complete waste of money then defining simple test to prove that planck level string theory is more than just an untestable religious revelation gussied up with loads of equations should be no problem at all right
46601 is there some material state that can propagate light indefinitely without dissipation or absorption like superconductors are able to transmit current indefinitely if not then the question is why not would some fundamental principle being violated in such material
46643 if photons are spin bosons then doesnt quantum mechanics imply that the allowed values for the component of spin in units of hbar are and why then in practice do we only use the pm states have been told that this is directly related to the two polarizations of the photon this seems to be more of classical argument however arising from the fact that maxwells equations do not permit longitudinal em waves in vacuum have also heard that it is related to the fact that photons have no rest mass although understand far less of this reasoning what im looking for are elaborations on these two arguments if have them correct and perhaps an argument as to how these two are equivalent if one exists

46801 my question isnt how they receive the energy to jump but why when someone views an elements emission spectrum we see line spectrum which proves that they dont exist outside of their orbitals else we would see continuous spectrum electrons can be released in the form of beta decay thus proving that they are capable of traveling outside of orbitals contrary to the statement my teacher said that they stay within orbitals then to add to the confusion the older model of rings floating around nucleus has from what can tell been outdated which would support this model my teachers explanation was that the electrons made quantum jump of some kind how do electrons move between orbitals or do we know how they jump excluding the reason that energy causes them to jump and why are positrons formed sometimes instead of electrons in beta decay when im asking how do electrons jump would like to know how an electron can jump between each orbital such as how it moves and how it knows where to jump since it appears to be jump where the electron doesnt slow into orbital position specifically how they jump what is this atomic electron transition understand that they jump and that they do this through absorbing and releasing energy but what is this atomic electron transition other than what is already on the wikipedia article http en wikipedia org wiki atomic electron transition

46893 am intrigued by the multiverse theory as mentioned in stephen hawkings new book the grand design according to his theory one can have different universes in one ultimate existence multiverse but what exactly differs between one universe and the other is it that there are different universes the existence of each of which cannot be measured from any other universe but all universes have identical laws of physics and all the physical constants such as the gravitational constant and the speed of light are the same across all universes there are different universes all of which are governed by the same laws of physics like general relativity and quantum mechanics eg the einstein gravitational equations and dirac equations are of the same form across all universes but where physical constants are different for example in another universe the speed of light may be only half of what it is here there are different universes but all these universes have different physical laws for example the einstein gravitational equations are only applicable in subset of these universes there can be universe where the gravitational equations take different form of mathematical expression and in weak gravitational field limit the gravitational force follows proportional square law instead of newtons inverse square law which of the above is the real multiverse theory in any of these cases fail to see how does the string theory theory gives rise to the multiverse concept any layman explanation for this
46929 for report im writing on quantum computing im interested in understanding little about this famous equation im an undergraduate student of math so can bear some formalism in the explanation however im not so stupid to think can understand this landmark without some years of physics ill just be happy to be able to read the equation and recognize it in its various forms to be more precise here are my questions hyperphysics tell me that shrodingers equation is wave equation in terms of the wavefunction where is the wave equation in the most general form of the equation mathrm hbar frac partial partial psi psi thought wave equation should be of the type frac partial partial 2t nabla 2u its the difference in order of of derivation that is bugging me from wikipedia the equation is derived by partially differentiating the standard wave equation and substituting the relation between the momentum of the particle and the wavelength of the wave associated with the particle in de broglies hypothesis can somebody show me the passages in simple or better general case think this questions is the most difficult to answer to newbie what is the hamiltonian of state how much generally speaking does the hamiltonian have to do do with the energy of state what assumptions did schr dinger make about the wave function of state to be able to write the equation or what are the important things should note in wave function that are basilar to proof the equation with both questions mean what are the passages between de broglie yes there are these waves and schr dinger the wave function is characterized by its often said the equation helps finds the form of the wave function as often as the equation helps us predict the evolution of wave function which of the two when one when the other
47084 it seems paradoxical that the strength of so many phenomena newtonian gravity coulomb force are calculable by the inverse square of distance however since volume is determined by three dimensions and presumably these phenomena have to travel through all three how is it possible that their strengths are governed by the inverse of the distance squared the gravitational force and intensity of light is merely times weaker at times the distance but the volume of sphere between the two is times larger since presumably these phenomena would affect all objects in spherical shell surrounding the source with equal intensity they travel in all three dimensions how come these laws do not obey an inverse cube relationship while traveling through space

47252 im student and had to give talk on seminar about quantum zeno effect and anti zeno effect to my colleagues all listeners have had course in quantum physics but not heavy one with all the bra and ket stuff my first idea to give simple explanation of zenos effect was this lets take look at exponential decay where the chance for particle or state to survive some time is tau if measure it after time tau have chance that it will still be intact if instead allow it to do its things only for time tau and then measure it the survival chance will be which approaches as increases to achieve the same total time have to repeat this procedure times and the total survival probability is so it obviously doesnt work get no zenos effect in this way its interesting that after gave the talk professor rose and said well this can be easily understood if we look at the exponential decay then he started drawing exponent and another exponent thats repeatedly interrupted and reset to initial state after small intervals later we agreed that this wont actually work but the question is why why doesnt this intuitively obvious way doesnt work and what would be the correct law out of which one could see the zenos effect is there any elegant way to explain this effect without heavy math and angles of state vectors additional question related is it correct to use name quantum zeno effect for turning of polarization by series of inclined polarizers or the thing that is done in this article
47368 someone once incorrectly told me that given the speed of light is the speed limit of the universe aliens would have to live for hundreds of years if they are to travel distances of hundreds of light years to reach earth in special relativistic and non expanding universe however this is not the case as velocity approaches the speed of light say 999c then we have gamma frac sqrt frac 999c frac sqrt frac 998001c let us assume that an alien wishes to travel light years from his planet to earth if the alien is travelling at 999c he will observe the distance between his planet and the earth to contract and will measure the contracted distance to be text distance frac mathrm ly gamma frac mathrm ly text light years the alien will be able to travel this distance in time of text time text distance text speed text years it is easy to show that as the aliens speed increases the time taken to travel the light year distance approaches it can thus be shown that thanks to length contraction and time dilation of special relativity all parts of special relativistic universe are accessible to an observer with finite life time we however dont live in purely special relativistic universe we live in an expanding universe given the universe is expanding are some parts of the universe no longer theoretically accessible to observers with finite life times

47527 maxwells equations in differential form are left begin align vec nabla cdot vec rho epsilon vec nabla times vec mu vec epsilon mu frac partial vec partial vec nabla times vec frac partial vec partial vec nabla cdot vec end align right which are respectively scalar vector pseudovector and pseudoscalar equations is this purely coincidence or is there deeper reason for having one of each type of equation if im not mistaken these objects correspond to or at least correspondence can be made with the ranks of differential forms on dimensional manifold so guess there might be some connection with the formulation of maxwells equations in terms of differential forms if this is this case is there an underlying physical reason that our expression of the equations turns out with one of each rank of equation or is it purely mathematical thing as final note might also be totally wrong about the rank of each equation im going on the contents of the right hand side magnetic charge density would be pseudoscalar
47754 from what understand an object entering the atmosphere will start to burn up from the tremendous resistance of the atmosphere presumably for asteroids under certain size they will burn up completely and never impact the surface of the earth do we have way of determining the minimum size needed for actual impact if so roughly what is the size and how does it compare to the average size of asteroids that pass by us regularly
47783 was wondering if there is closed form formula for the force between two masses and if relativistic effects are included my understanding is that the classic formula frac is just an approximation which is good enough for probably even going to the moon but what would the correct formula be according to the general theory of relativity does closed formula even exist for example for an idealized situation of just two spherical masses with homogenous mass distribution

47859 im reading sean carrolls book on general relativity and have question about the definition of an inertial reference frame in the first chapter thats dedicated to special relativity the author describes way of constructing reference frame in the following manner the spatial coordinates comprise standard cartesian system constructed for example by welding together rigid rods that meet at right angels the rods must be moving freely unaccelerated the time coordinate is defined by set of clocks which are not moving with respect to spatial coordinates the clocks are synchronized in the following sense imagine that we send beam of light from point in space to point in straight line at constant velocity and then immediately back to at velocity then the time on the coordinate clock when the light beam reaches point which we label should be halfway between the time on the coordinate clock when the beam left point and the time on the same clock when it returned frac the coordinate system thus constructed is an inertial frame first of all it is not completely clear what does the rods must be moving freely unaccelerated exactly mean unaccelerated compared to what secondly and this is my main question is the ability to synchronize clocks is unique to inertial frames if the frame is not inertial in the sense that newtons second law vec frac vec dt does not hold is it still possible that for set of clocks which are not moving with respect to the spatial coordinates of this frame that the equation frac will always hold for any points in space and beam of light traveling between them can the ability to synchronize clocks be used as criteria for inertial frames
47901 in 2d cartesian coordinates the euclidean metric begin bmatrix end bmatrix is flat space if the diagonal elements are exchanged for other real numbers greater or less than zero would this still count as flat space even though it is no longer euclidean think the answer is yes but just want to make sure also when physicist says that the local tangent space on manifold is flat do they imply that the metric is locally euclidean or can the diagonal elements be any non zero real number in that local tangent space

47951 entanglement also allows multiple states to be acted on simultaneously unlike classical bits that can only have one value at time entanglement is necessary ingredient of any quantum computation that cannot be done efficiently on classical computer qubit wikipedia thought this was the definition of superposition why is quantum entanglement so important in quantum computing to the point where advances are also measured in number of qubits entangled
48019 in all thermodynamics texts that have seen expressions such as operatorname ln and operatorname ln are used where is temperature and is entropy and also with other thermodynamic quantities such as volume etc but have always thought that this is incorrect because the arguments in expessions such as operatorname ln and ought to be dimensionless indeed at undergraduate level always tried to rewrite these expressions in the form operatorname ln frac so is it correct to use expressions such as operatorname ln at some level

48275 we just bought green laser pointer on ebay and had discussion about the safety the laser is low end chinese one usd free shipping and the seller says this green laser pointer point pen 532nm output power 5mw class iiib the most confusion comes from the class iiib which according to wikipedia should be not safe for common use because it can damage eye even with accidential look or reflection however directly on the pointer is this max power output less than 5mw wavelegnth 532nm class iii laser product this product complies with cfr so this looks that it should not be class iiib also because the power is less than 5mw while according to wikipedia the class should be for mw also have couple of small red keychain lasers which all are the same power output and class do not intend to shine anybody in the eyes but my sister was afraid that there could be potential risk to damage someones eyes with accidential quick exposure reflection from window in class or directly from the chalkboard to the class the green pointer seems to have very intensive light compared to the red ones but it could be subjective impression caused by the different color think there is rather an incorrect information on the selling page and that the pointer should be safe but am rather asking to be sure thanks
48284 is it possible to constrain the height volume flow or distance of waterfall from the quantitative analysis of high quality recording of its sound as an aside the simulated sounds of fluid splashing or pouring water have been synthesized by computer the group that did this research was at cornell university this seems like an example of solution to the forward problem if you listen to the simulation with closed eyes can you distinguish the waterfall from the running faucet raindrop sizes have been identified by different physical mechanisms associated with the drop splashes and used as basis for acoustic rain gauges my question is about how to find partial solution for the inverse problem from sound measurements how could one differentiate very high falls from modest height ones say compare snoqualmie falls 82m and angel falls 979m the spectrum of waterfall sound is qualitatively described as broadband or brown noise and have not yet found good example of an actual acoustic spectrum for waterfall think that the total sound energy radiated into the air and into the ground would equal the gravitational energy released by the falling water less small amount of energy that is turned into heat and warms the water it seems to me that the spectra of 100m versus 1000m waterfall might have predictable different ratios of low frequency and high frequency power are there fluid mechanical or acoustic mechanisms that come into play for the higher falls which do not operate at lower heights could there be diagnostic sounds related to cavitation would there be too much sound reflection and scattering in real waterfall basin to make measurements my conclusions ok think have satisfactory answer to my question now and have awarded the bounty to zhermes believe his response correctly describes the underlying physics of the problem and once got that was able to find lot more relevant information and perform some pretty approximate preliminary calculations in nutshell the important physical process may be the resonant scattering of ambient sound inside the turbulent waterfall by bubble clouds this is referred to as minnaert resonance and has been extended to describe bubble clouds as well as individual air bubbles the approach has been used productively to analyze the noise of propeller blades and the sound of ocean waves found it useful way to begin thinking about how the sound of waterfall may be affected by the height of the falls the resonant frequency of spherical bubble cloud is inversely proportional to the radius of the cloud also found examples of analyses that showed dependency for the power spectrum of this type of noise as suggested by zhermes too so we might anticipate that the low frequency cut off in the power spectrum of waterfall noise may be determined by the maximum size of the bubble clouds one obvious insight is that it seems that it has to be sound being generated in the plunge pool at the base of the waterfall that contains information about the full height sounds originating in the flow meters from the top of 1000m falls should be no different than for meter falls once the water falls the additional 990m it has also gained more kinetic energy which would be available to generate bubble cloud having size dependent upon the waterfall height equating the gravitational energy of water at the top of the falls the kinetic energy of water when it hits the plunge pool and the work to push jet into the pool calculated the maximum depth the jet could penetrate into the pool and took that as the maximum size of the bubble cloud this estimate for the bubble cloud size is proportional to the inverse square root of the waterfall height substituting in standard conditions for water and pressure this analysis yielded low frequency cut off frequency which was also the frequency of maximum power that was far into the infrasound range hz and below the frequency range of human hearing the conclusion to draw from these calculations may be that the pitch of high and low waterfalls is not very different in the range of human hearing differences might be perceptible for falls having large volumetric flows that are capable of generating lots of power at the limits of hearing differences might also be perceived felt rather than heard as infrasound perhaps this explains why mp3 recordings of waterfalls cascades and streams sound so similar we may be missing the information coming to us as infrasound
48375 fields in classical mechanics are observables for example can measure the value of the electric field at some xt in quantum field theory the classical field is promoted to an operator valued function of space time but no one talks about eigenvectors of the quantum field if try to measure the field at one point in spacetime should get real value which should be an eigenvalue of the quantum field right guess the eigenvectors of the quantum field also live in fock space
48392 was reading landau lifshitzs classical theory of fields and noticed that they mention that an extended rigid body isnt relativistically correct for example if you consider rigid rod and apply torque at one end by definition of being rigid the whole body must start rotating at the same instant but the information about the force being applied cannot travel faster than the speed of light the book hasnt mentioned how to resolve this paradox and after thinking about it for while im wondering if one can even define rigid body in relativistically correct manner to summarize how does one define rigid body in special relativity
48399 always wondered how much information we get from color things we see have different colors edible products change color when began to spoil so we have notion what color fresh product should have and the colors we see are very small part of electromagnetic spectrum so is there something special in the visible spectrum or any part of electromagnetic spectrum of the same size is just as good
48497 when coming up with definition of temperature its typical to start with an empirical definition that system with hotter temperature tends to lose heat to system with colder temperature combined with the second law of thermodynamics that leads to the condition that for two systems in thermodynamic equilibrium frac partial partial frac partial partial consider it implicit throughout this question that volumes are constant so temperature has to be some function of partial partial furthermore wed like the object that loses the heat to be the one with the hotter temperature so temperature has to be inversely related to partial partial of course the conventional choice is frac frac partial partial but if we were rederiving thermodynamics and statistical mechanics from scratch is there any reason we couldnt have chosen frac partial partial instead sure it would lead to many common temperatures being negative but suppose were willing to accept that is there any other useful property that the standard definition of temperature has which wouldnt be shared by would it necessarily lead to nonlinear thermometers for example as michael brown pointed out in comment this alternative definition is just beta so guess another roughly equivalent way of saying what im asking would be is there practical reason not to use beta or as temperature instead of ive already looked at this question and this one and some others but any close to relevant answers there seem to be saying merely that its conventional to define temperature the way it is defined not that we couldnt have done it differently

49745 for system of electric charges at positions mathbf with nonzero net charge sum one can define centre of charge in the obvious way as mathbf frac sum mathbf this concept is definitely not as useful as one might naively hope but it does have physical significance as the position of the origin that sets the systems dipole moment and therefore the dipolar term in multipolar expansion to zero that means then that the monopole approximation is far better in the far field than normally the electrostatic potential goes as phi mathbf frac mathbf mathbf left frac mathbf mathbf right where the subleading term is of order instead of as usual for neutral system with however the concept of centre of charge is meaningless and there is no monopole term in the expansion the relevant concept is then the dipole moment mathbf sum mathbf mathbf which is independent of the position mathbf of the origin however this means that the relative importance of the subleading term in the multipole expansion is higher than above phi mathbf frac mathbf cdot mathbf mathbf mathbf left frac mathbf mathbf right my question is for neutral system is it possible to find suitable position mathbf for the origin that will set the subleading quadrupole term to zero since this entails system of five equations linear in mathbf when suspect this is impossible in general geometries if this is the case which geometries allow for vanishing quadrupole moments and which ones dont in the cases where one can do this does this position have special name more generally if all multipole moments up to some geq0 are zero when can the subleading term be made to vanish

49853 have recently made the decision to study physics seriously however in the past ive had some difficulty with the subject because of my primarily mathematical background find that sometimes even if my reasoning is axiomatically correct it doesnt lead to the right answer for simple reasons like made wrong assumption or hadnt assumed something should have so have three questions is there some system or method can use to determine what assumptions should be making this is important to me because it seems the problems ive encountered traditionally seem to be open ended in this regard when theyre not simple plug and chug questions theres also the question of definitions am uncomfortable with the fact that most definitions are not rigorous enough this usually leaves some room for interpretation and consequently its unclear how they may be applied to certain situations how do know if the interpretation ive made of the definition is accurate thirdly when im reasoning with problem im not sure if at each step what ive concluded is accurate or would actually happen in reality this applies especially to problems where im asked to make simplifying assumptions such as assume the surface is friction less or assume the rod supporting the beam is mass less which simply wouldnt be applicable in the real world so im not really sure what to model my reasoning after in these cases how can get around this also is solving such problems really helpful as far as learning actual physics goes can only speak for classical physics as havent progressed much further is modern physics the same in this regard or is it more axiomatic finally if there really isnt any systematic approach to this then how can we really call the process science isnt the scientific method all about finding agreement thanks for all the help in advance
49936 in space time is smooth not foamy space com article it is stated in his general theory of relativity einstein described space time as fundamentally smooth warping only under the strain of energy and matter some quantum theory interpretations disagree however viewing space time as being composed of froth of minute particles that constantly pop into and out of existence what are these quantum theory interpretations the article is talking about can you quickly summarize the physics behind this experiment
50106 allover the web am only seeing statement similar to this pair production is not possible in vaccum 3rd particle is needed so that conservation of momentum holds well noone out of many writers shows how to prove this matematically so this is what interests me here first wanted to know if pair production really cannot happen in vacuum so drew picture and used equations for conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to calculate energy of photon nu needed for pair production it turns out nu is different if calculate it out of conservation of energy or conservation of momentum and even more it can never be the same because equallity would mean parts cos alpha and cos beta should equall speed of light well that cannot happen below is my derivation conservation of energy scriptsize begin split nu ke 0e ke 0e nu left ec gammav ec right ec left ec gammav ec right ec nu ec gammav ec gammav nu ec left gammav gammav right end split conservation of momentum direction scriptsize begin split sin alpha sin beta gammav sin alpha gammav sin beta text if boxed alpha beta longrightarrow boxed and end split begin split scriptsize end split direction scriptsize begin split frac lambda cos alpha cos beta frac nu gammav cos alpha gammav cos beta nu big gammav underbrace cos alpha neq gammav underbrace cos beta neq big end split alltogether because momentum in direction equals holds for some combinations of alpha beta whole momentum equals just the momentum in direction so if add them get scriptsize nu big gammav underbrace cos alpha neq gammav underbrace cos beta neq big from this can conclude only that cannot sucessfully apply conservation of energy and conservation of momentum at the same time and therefore pair production in vacuum cannot happen question1 why do writers state that 3rd particle is needed so that conservation of momentum holds what if conservation of momentum holds and conservation of energy doesnt how can we say which one holds and which one doesnt question2 do writters actually mean that if 3rd particle is included we can achieve nu to match in both cases question3 can someone show me mathematically how this is done mean it should right

51220 im having problems understanding the following situation suppose two tonne cars are going with the same orientations but opposite senses each km with respect to the road then the total energy is begin eqnarray frac mathrm times50 mathrm km mathrm frac mathrm times50 mathrm km mathrm mathrm times50 mathrm km mathrm frac mathrm times mathrm km mathrm end eqnarray now if we look at it from the point of view of one of the cars then the total energy is begin eqnarray frac mathrm times0 mathrm km mathrm frac mathrm times100 mathrm km mathrm frac mathrm times100 mathrm km mathrm frac mathrm times mathrm km mathrm end eqnarray know that kinetic energy is supposed to change when change the frame of reference but understand that then there must be some other kind of energy to make up for it so that the energy in the system stays unchanged but dont see any other kind of energy here only see two total energies of the same system that seem to be different could you explain this to me please note that while dont understand any physics do understand college level mathematics so if necessary please use it doubt anything more than high school maths should be needed here but want to say this just in case
51522 my intuition tell me that at the focal length convex lens all the light converges to point following that logic it would make sense to me that camera chip would either need to go slightly in front or slightly behind the focal point in order to expose the entire chip to the incoming light this would produce normal or inverted image respectively upon investigating this question read through these articles wikipedia focal length paragon press focal length the photo forum that all agree that the sensor must be placed at the focal length not in front or behind how does chip placed at the focal length not just produce white spot of light at the center
51556 have read here that frac mv must not be applied on photon ever if want to calculate escape velocity need to use frac mv because we say that kinetic energy positive must be same or larger than gravitational potential which is negative in order for an object to escape it is done like this begin split frac mv left frac gmm right sqrt frac 2gm end split than we say if there is black hole inside certain radius we call schwarzschield radius sch not even light can escape because its escape velocity is smaller than needed to escape at the border of the sphere with sch light can barely escape so it must hold that equals escape velocity so we write down the equation below and derive sch begin split sqrt frac 2gm sch sch frac 2gm end split this is well known equation but it is derived allso using frac mv for light photons this is in contradiction with 1st statement in this post so is the last equation even valid

51875 at school ive always learned that you can view current and voltage like this the current is the flow of charge per second and the voltage is how badly the current wants to flow but im having some trouble with this view how can we have voltage without current there is nothing to flow so how can it be there or is it latent voltage mean is the voltage just always there and if current is introduced it flows also believe you cant have current without voltage this to me seems logical from the very definition of current but if you have charge without voltage doesnt it just stay in place can you view it like that if you introduce charge in circuit without voltage it just doesnt move

52249 lets say have two planets that are one hundred thousand lightyears away from each other and my immortal friend on the other planet want to communicate with strong laser and tachyon communication device record message on the tachyon communication device and release the message at exactly the same time as activate the laser both of which are directed to the other planet which is one hundred thousand lightyears away say it is the year for both of us at the time did this if tachyons existed then the message would arrive to my friend before the photons in the laser it would arrive say thousand years earlier from my vantage point that message will arrive to her at year the same would be true for my friends vantage point however she will only see the laser at year so since she got the message at year she immediately sends me reply back going through the same procedure as did she records message and releases it at the same time as the laser the tachyons will arrive years earlier than the laser so for me will receive the message at year will receive the laser however at year it seems to me that communication this way does not violate causality will still have received the message after had sent it if tachyons truly violated causality though realize it should arrive at year for her and so she can reply to me at year which would mess me up by year as will ask her how she knew was planning on sending her message before sent it could send her different message which she would end up receiving at year and will end up confusing her as she would have received one message asking her out and the other asking her how did she know was asking her out she then decides am crazy and sends me message at year that she does not want to date me and so she will have both turned me down and entertained me before have even asked her out on the other hand lets go back to year and add third device to our list an alcubierre drive after send out the message and the laser get impatient and do not feel like waiting years so get on my alcubierre drive spaceship and arrive on her planet at the same year my friend is not in her office so leave note to her also immortal secretary saying dropped by and that she should expect message for her in year then get back on my alcubierre drive and land back on my planet still on year meanwhile the tachyons and photons sent out are still racing to arrive to her by year she receives the message just as alcubierre drive back to her and pick her up for dinner but the point of my question is it seems to me that just going faster than light if that alone was what you had would not violate causality it must be something else understand time dilation and that things with mass cannot travel at the speed of light but using the alcubierre drive hypothetically speaking was still able to outpace the photons while also having mass it still did not produce causality problems alcubierre drives are also valid solutions to gr it seems circular to me to say that what makes traveling faster than light violate causality is because it violates causality if faster than light communication was divorced from causality problems then the causality problem would cause itself thereby violating causality and hence we would scrap it and conclude that there is no causality problem after all what is it that am missing if someone could help me out that would be excellent ive been itching to ask my friend out for few millenia now

52417 why is an invariant vector subspace sometimes called representation for example in lie algebras say su3 the subspace characterized by the highest weight is an irreducible representation of dimension of su3 however representation of lie algebra is lie algebra homomorphism from the algebra to subspace of the so called general linear algebra of some vector space or in other words the representation is map that assigns elements of the algebra to elements of the set of linear endomorphisms of some vector space in the previous example the subspace is subspace in which the action of the endomorphisms maps its elements into themselves so by the definition the irreducible representation should be the mapping that associates the endomorphisms to the elements of the algebra and not the space in which they act

53012 in john preskills review of monopoles he states on nowadays we have another way of understanding why electric charge is quantized charge is quantized if the electromagnetic ul rm em gauge group is compact but ul rm em is automatically compact in unified gauge theory in which ul rm em is embedded in nonabelian semisimple group note that the standard weinberg salam glashow model is not unified according to this criterion the implication of the third sentence is that in some circumstances the u1 rm em gauge group may not be compact how could this be since u1 as differentiable manifold is diffeomorphic to isnt it automatically always compact the following paragraph in other words in unified gauge theory the electric charge operator obeys nontrivial commutation relations with other operators in the theory just as the angular momentum algebra requires the eigenvalues of to be integer multiples of frac hbar the commutation relations satisfied by the electric charge operator require its eigenvalues to be integer multiples of fundamental unit this conclusion holds even if the symmetries generated by the charges that fail to commute with electric charge are spontaneously broken is ok but dont follow what that has to do with the compactness of u1
53230 consider these two situations when driving on long straight road uphill starting at high velocity which the car is able to maintain starting at lower velocity and then trying to reach while driving uphill in my experience ive noticed that in case it is very hard and sometimes impossible to reach the velocity even though if the car had started in that velocity it would have been able to maintain it this observation was confirmed by another person know if we do simple analysis of the problem assuming the engine outputs some fixed power it seems that there should be no problem reaching is there something in the inner workings of the car like the transmission or fuel injection for example that would make it harder than expected to accelerate uphill for simplicity lets assume the car is always in the same gear
53306 cyclotron radiation is radiation emitted by charged particle being bent by magnetic field the only difference between cyclotron and synchrotron radiation is that the latter occurs at relativistic speeds is this right now afaik synchrotron radiation is artificially produced by channeling the accelerated particle beam guess this would generally be electrons but suppose it could be protons like in the lhc into an insertion device know that wigglers and undulators are both examples but im unclear on what exactly the difference between those two is what dont get is what is done in free electron laser that differentiates it from regular old synchrotron radiation source apparently synchrotron radiation is coherent so it clearly is not that moreover im confused where the stimulated emission comes into play according to wikipedia free electron laser uses free electrons thus the name instead of for example chromium doped sapphire ruby as the gain medium except hold on the electrons certainly arent static theyre moving quite rapidly so how would the photons reflect back to stimulate emission if the electrons are still moving forward right past them am correct in my assumptions or am totally wrong to begin with unfortunately wikipedia is rather vague on the subject have tried to do some research on the subject but have found very little on the actual construction of free electron laser at least that wasnt behind paywall thanks for your help
53318 while studying the dirac equation came across this enigmatic passage on in from classical to quantum mechanics by esposito marmo sudarshan regarding the gamma matrices tag gamma gamma tag gamma gamma gamma gamma tag gamma gamma gamma gamma neq in looking for solutions of these equations in terms of matrices one finds that they must have as order multiple of and that there exists solution of order obviously the word order here means dimension in my qm classes the lecturer referenced chapter from advanced quantum mechanics by schwabl especially as regards the dimension of dirac gamma matrices however there it is stated only that since the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of alpha and beta must be equal is even moreover is not sufficient so is the smallest possible dimension in which it is possible to realize the desired algebraic structure while got that the smallest dimension is fail to find any argument to reject the possibility that could be solution also checked this phys se post but didnt find it helpful at all can anyone help me
53334 apologies in advance for the long question my understanding is that in gr massive observers move along timelike curves mu lambda and if an observer moves from point mu lambda to mu lambda then his clock will measure that an amount of time ba given by the curves arc length ba int lambda lambda lambda sqrt mu nu lambda dot mu lambda dot nu lambda will have elapsed where mu nu is metric on spacetime with signature why is this so here is how would attempt to justify this fact in special relativity with mu nu eta mu nu consider an inertial observer in mathbb and suppose that this observer sees clock which ill call observer moving around on curve mu lambda if were also an inertial observer then given any event with coordinates mu as measured by observer would measure the coordinates of the event to be mu lambda mu phantom mu nu nu mu for some lorentz transformation lambda if is not inertial then this is no longer true and there is some more complicated family of transformations say lambda between events as seen by both observers would argue however that if we were to partition the interval lambda lambda into large number of intervals lambda lambda dots lambda lambda with lambda lambda epsilon and epsilon lambda lambda then on each interval is approximately an inertial observer in the sense that lambda mathcal epsilon qquad star for some poincare transformation then we would note that since is stationary in his own reference frame he measures his worldline to have the property dot mu lambda dot lambda mathbf so that ba int lambda lambda lambda sqrt eta mu nu dot mu dot mu int lambda lambda lambda sqrt dot lambda lambda ba on the other hand the integral on the left can be written as riemann sum using the partition above and we can invoke star above to get begin align ba lim to infty left sum epsilon sqrt eta mu nu dot mu lambda dot nu lambda right notag lim to infty left sum epsilon sqrt eta mu nu dot mu lambda dot nu lambda mathcal epsilon right notag int lambda lambda lambda sqrt eta mu nu dot mu dot mu end align combining these two computations gives the desired result how do others feel about this argument im not completely comfortable with it because of the assumption star made on lambda imagine that in gr similar argument could be made by invoking local flatness of the metric
53338 im still in high school and while cant complain about the quality of my teachers all of them have done at least bachelor some masters usually am cautious to believe what they say straight away since im interested quite bit in physics know more about it than other subjects and spot things disagree with more often and this is the most recent thing while discussing photons my teacher made couple of statements which might be true but sound foreign to me he said that under certain conditions photons have mass didnt think this was true at all think he said this to avoid confusion regarding mc however in my opinion it only adds to the confusion since objects with mass cant travel with the speed of light and light does have tendency to travel with the speed of light myself understand how photons can have momentum while having no mass because lurk this site but my classmates dont he said photons dont actually exist but are handy to envision this dazzled my mind even more so since he followed this statement by explaining the photo electric effect which to me seems like proof of the existence of photons as the quantum of light he might have done this to avoid confusion regarding the wave particle duality this all seems very odd to me and hope some of you can clarify
53482 wikipedia says in particle physics supersymmetry often abbreviated susy is symmetry that relates elementary particles of one spin to other particles that differ by half unit of spin and are known as superpartners in theory with unbroken supersymmetry for every type of boson there exists corresponding type of fermion with the same mass and internal quantum numbers other than spin and vice versa there is only indirect evidence for the existence of supersymmetry want mathematical explanation of susy
53530 at least on television ski jumpers seem to fall great vertical distances before they hit the ground at least few dozen meters though couldnt find exact distances via quick search and yet they almost always land on their feet as if they just fell two or three meters heres whole lot of footage from the vancouver olympics if you need to refresh your memory without going into the level of equations which wouldnt understand why are ski jumpers able to fall such great heights without seriously injuring themselves
53558 after some reading about the large hadron collider and its very impressive instruments to detect and investigate the collision results there is remaining question what would happen if the scientists would use leptons instead of hadrons especially what would happen if they would collide electrons isnt it intrinsic that all particles consist of smaller particles with current technology could we detect them
53587 know that if space ship suddenly traveled very fast its astronauts would be fly against the back wall potentially getting hurt if the space ship suddenly stopped they would also fly against the front wall suppose that space ship could accelerate at constant rate time speed pm stopped pm kph pm kph pm kph as the space ship is accelerating at constant rate would the astronauts constantly feel the forward motion of the craft for the duration of their journey would the astronauts begin to feel that the motion is becoming faster and faster if the space ship continued to accelerate in this manner for many hours would the astronauts eventually be injured by the great speed
53648 am not physicist am software engineer while trying to fall asleep recently started thinking about the following there are many explanations online of how any object stays in orbit the explanation boil down to balance of the objects tangential force with centripetal force but suppose something upsets this balance by miniscule amount say meteorite or spaceship crashing into earth doesnt this start positive feedback process to break earth out of orbit suppose the meteorite crashes such that the earth is briefly forced toward the sun the meteorite contributes to the centripetal force now earth is just smidgen closer to the sun due to the equation frac that everyone learns in high school physics the suns centripetal force acting on earth in turn increases that pulls earth even closer to the sun increasing centripetal force yet more and so on similar argument applies to briefly forcing earth away from the sun empirically want to say that theres buffer such that if the balance of forces is disrupted by less than we remain in orbit but cannot justify any buffer from the equation above so what am missing how can objects in orbit suffer minor perturbations in the balance of tangential and centripetal force and yet remain in orbit when it appears to me that any perturbation starts positive feedback loop
53731 have just begun studying quantum field theory and am following the book by peskin and schroeder for that so while quantising the klein gordon field we fourier expand the field and then work only in the momentum space what is the need for this expansion
53802 in non relativistic qm the delta in the time energy uncertainty principle is the limiting standard deviation of the set of energy measurements of identically prepared systems as goes to infinity what does the delta mean since is not even an observable
53913 it is generally agreed upon that electromagnetic waves from an emitter do not have to connect to receiver but how can we be sure this is fact the problem is that we can never observe non received em waves because if we observe them the instrument of observation becomes receiver electromagnetic waves have changing electric and magnetic fields and are both electric and magnetic electric current connects like from an anode to cathode magnetic fields illustrated by flux lines connect from one magnetic pole to another and no non connecting flux lines are observed so electric currents connect and magnetic fields connect so why doesn the electromagnetic wave also always connect to receiver receiver which could be plasma particle planet star and anything else which can absorb em radiation there is one big problem if photon has to be emitted in the direction of future receiver the photon must know where future receiver will be so this conflicts with our view on causality or cause creating an effect and as the emitter doesn know where the receiver will be some time in the future it cant emit an em wave against it but how can we know that the causality principle is always valid without exceptions there seems to be reasons for questioning the universal validity of the causality principle information does not have mass and may then not be restricted by the speed of light so the causality principle may not always hold for massless particles waves when something travels with the speed of light it will experience that distance become zero if there is no distance there is full connection and continuous electromagnetic wave between the emitter and receiver again using the photon as reference frame is not something relativistic physicists seem to like maxwells electromagnetic wave equation has simple and an advanced solution the advanced solution is usually discarded because the effect happens before the cause but in wheeler feynman absorber theory the advanced solution is used because it works see this link for more information http en wikipedia org wiki wheeler e2 93feynman absorber theory the field of quantum mechanics is discussing many different causality problems like the observation of particle might decide where the particle will be in time and space relevant to this discussion is the question of what triggers the atom to emit light over the last hundred years physicists have discovered systems that change from one state to another without any apparent physical trigger these systems are described by quantum mechanics the simplest such system is the hydrogen atom it just an electron bound to proton two particles that about as simple as you can get according to qm the electron can occupy one of discrete set of energy levels the electron can be excited to higher energy level by absorbing photon when the electron drops from higher energy level to lower level it emits photon quantum of light quantum mechanics describes this process beautifully but it only predicts the average time the electron will stay in the higher energy level it doesn give any clue as to the specific time the electron will drop to the lower level more precisely the transition rate the probability of transition per unit time is constant it doesn matter how long it has been since the atom was excited the transition rate stays the same when you first encounter this you can quite wrap your brain around it surely there must be some internal mechanism some kind of clock that ticks along and finally goes off causing the transition but no such mechanism has ever been found qm has had an unexcelled record of accurate predictions without any need for such mechanism george mason university physicist robert oerter so is the excited atom random generator or is it something external that triggers the release of photon it seems like it something external and this external trigger might be the unphysical connection to future receiver described by the advanced solution to maxwell equation of electromagnetic radiation so it seems to me like we currently can be sure if photon is always emitted against receiver or it is emitted randomly in any direction into space but this question might be one of the most important questions ever asked because if an electromagnetic wave is always connected to receiver the implications are vast it could shed light on the discussion of many topics it might change our view on time and space it might not only be the past pushing the present forward but the future pulling on the present making syntropy which will create order out of chaos and describe the marvelous universe we live in even the view of the present itself as sharp line between the past and the future could be questioned time itself might not be totally linear and the future may change the past to avoid paradoxes with time travel we have to allow number of parallel universes as suggested by american physicist hugh everett who formulated the idea of their existence to explain the theory that every possible outcome of every choice we have actually does happen but before we can fully dive into all these fascinating questions we have to solve this question does an electromagnetic wave always have to connect to receiver this hypothetical question might seem purely philosophical but it is not and it might even be confirmed by observations we can directly observe non received photons but we might indirectly observe the existence or nonexistence of these photons any answer or suggestions are most welcome
54010 have calculated that because venus is mathrm km in diameter and moves at mathrm km mathrm it would take frac frac mathrm km mathrm km mathrm mathrm mathrm min mathrm for venus to appear totally in front of the sun this time would be from the edge of venus being against the edge of the sun to when the opposite edge of venus is in touch with the same edge of the sun but now think this in reality takes more than just minutes about minutes if this is true then why does this measurement not agree with theory
54162 to an an external observer it appears that time has stopped for photon but this relation is reflexive so for an observer travelling with the photon it appears the universe has stopped everywhere is this right space also gets distorted parallel to the direction of motion but not perpendicular to it does this mean that for an observer travelling with photon sees spacetime as flat plane note im using language vividly not literally when say photon experiences space and time not that im against idealist or panpyschist interpretations of matter or energy come to that note since its been pointed out that an inertial frame cant be boosted into the frame of photon and moreover there is no limiting behaviour here no matter what frame you are boosted into light will always appear to travel at nevertheless when an external observer watches train chasing photon by gradually increasing its speed he will note that the train speed is approaching the speed of the photon but will never match it and when he looks at the clock inside the train he will not too that it is gradually slowing down but never actually stops using this picture we can attempt the thought experiment if not one that can be carried out of what world looks like to photon
54184 ask this question because have read two different quotes on the uncertainty principle that dont seem to match very well there are similar questions around here but would like an explanation that reconciles these two interpretations specifically feynman talks about the uncertainty principle in one of his lectures and mentions it as the reason why electrons dont crash into the atoms nucleus if they did they would have an exact location and momentum which is not allowed by the uncertainty principle in saying this it is clear that the uncertainty principle is fundamental property of nature because it has an effect on where an electron can reside recently read somewhere else but forgot where exactly an account of the uncertainty principle where there was explained how we can measure position of particle by firing another particle into it the collision disturbs the velocity of the observed particle therefore we can not know its momentum anymore now very much seems like limitation of what the observer can know while attributes fundamental property of nature to it electrons dont crash into the nucleus what is the correct way to think about this
54323 could someone explain to me what the collision of two photons would look like will they behave like electromagnetic waves they will interfere with each other and keep their wave nature particles they will bounce like classical balls assume that energy of that system is too small to make creation of pairs possible
54392 there are two very famous quotes from german nobel laureate albert abraham michelson that are remembered mainly for being extremely wrong especially since he said them just before two major revolutions in physics quantum mechanics and relativity the more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all been discovered and these are so firmly established that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedingly remote many other instances might be cited but these will suffice to justify the statement that our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals it is however somewhat understandable that michelson thought physics was almost completed almost every physics related phenomenon that human could encounter in day to day life had been explained including gravity motion and electromagnetism with the advent of quantum mechanics even more physical phenomena have been explained it has gotten to the point nowadays that to layman it might seem that physics is indeed complete as far as know the exceptions to this rule lie very deep within the realm of theoretical physics in topics such as quantum gravity dark matter or dark energy these are things that the average person doesnt know thing about furthermore and in contrast to classical mechanics he really doesnt need to know about them since they mostly involve worlds that are very small very big very far away or very hypothetical this leads me to my question are there any everyday phenomena that remain unexplained by physics to clarify by everyday mean regarding stuff that the average person knows something about and might perhaps encounter in everyday life for example an unresolved issue in mechanics might qualify even if it is not common effect
54422 in solid mechanics can always assume that if an object undergoes no strain then no stress is applied to it think its true only because cant seem to find counter example
54431 was wondering how far in imaging physics had gotten do we hold the technology to actually take picture of say an alpha particle or even single atom realise we arent talking about camera pictures so what kind of imaging techniques have taken images is most likely to be the technique to take an image of single atom
54493 was reading about growing single crystals and im little confused about this in most crystal growing processes seed crystal is used and the rest of the material crystallizes on the seed crystal for example the czochrlaski process but thinking about entropy wouldnt it be more favourable for the vapour liquid to not crystallize and hence maintain larger disorder similar process occurs in supersaturated vapour as well where small liquid droplet acts as seed for more condensation to occur so suspect im missing something but cant figure out what
54534 consider any wave packet describing free particle so no potential or other forces acting on it then it can be shown that delta does not change in time however my question is what happens with delta as we go forward in time does it have to increase at all times or is there counter example where the uncertainty in position is decreasing if even for short time period my initial guess is delta must always increase because neq so that delta neq0 and hence delta frac delta neq but if theres spread in velocities then the wave packet must also spread is this logic correct or could we have wave packet where the back of it would move forward faster than the front and for certain period until that back end catches up with the front one it would actually be narrower than at the outset reducing delta if yes how would one describe such free particle wave packet so it does seem to me that every wave packet describing free particle will eventually spread but the question is whether there can be time period in its evolution when it is actually becoming narrower edit in particular if it does not have to increase at all times can this be shown without appealing to time reversal
54615 as far as know its possible to create radially polarised ring magnet where one pole is on the inside and the field lines cross the circumference at right angles so imagine if made one which was shaped like sector of torus then forced load of these magnets into complete torus clearly this magnet is impossible because theres no way for the field lines to get back into the middle so what happens to the field in this case does it disappear completely do the magnets blow up
54674 know im wrong but this is my line of thought if electrons are indistinguishable then why do we have an exclusion principle if we have two electrons in an orbital the pauli exclusion principle says that they cant have the same set of quantum numbers but then what does that say about electrons being indistinguishable so we have these two electrons that are supposed to be indistinguishable but then we say no they cant have the same set of quantum numbers isnt this making them distinguishable then
54717 what is the highest speed time dilation has been tested how close to the special relativity prediction did it get
54814 for diatomic molecules the morse potential describes their potential energy as function of separation distance between the two particles my question is what is the explanation of of the dip and the equilibrium altogether am assuming that potential is related to temperature of of the molecule as the molecule approaches absolute zero it ceases to move and so all of its energy becomes potential and the separation distance goes to zero however if the molecule is heated up the separation distance increases it expands after it reaches the equilibrium point it somehow seems to gain potential energy although it is also gaining kinetic energy as well it is heated up it would be moving very fast so is energy not conserved in such system otherwise am misinterpreting the system altogether
54896 my text introduces multi quibt quantum states with the example of state that can be factored into two non entangled substates it then goes on to suggest that it should be obvious1 that the joint state of two non entangled substates should be the tensor product of the substates that is for example that given first qubit left right rangle alpha left right rangle alpha left right rangle and second qubit left right rangle beta left right rangle beta left right rangle any non entangled joint two qubit state of left right rangle and left right rangle will be left right rangle otimes left right rangle alpha beta left right rangle alpha beta left right rangle alpha beta left right rangle alpha beta left right rangle but it isnt clear to me why this should be the case it seems to me there is some implicit understanding or interpretation of the coefficients alpha and beta that is used to arrive at this conclusion its clear enough why this should be true an classical case where the coefficients represent where normalized relative abundance so that the result follows from simple combinatorics but what accounts for the assertion that this is true for quantum system in which at least in my text up to this point coefficients only have this correspondence by analogy and perplexing analogy at that since they can be complex and negative should it be obvious that independent quantum states are composed by taking the tensor product or is some additional observation or definition of the nature of the coefficients of quantum states required see bottom of so the state of the two qubits must be the product emphasis added
54907 it puzzles me that zee uses throughout the book this definition of covariant derivative mu phi partial mu phi iea mu phi with minus sign despite of the use of the convention but then see that srednicki at least in the free preprint uses too the same definition with the same minus sign the weird thing is that srednicki uses looked too into peskin schr der who stick to the same as zee and the covariant derivative there is mu phi partial mu phi iea mu phi now can any of you tell pocoyo what is happening here why can they consistently use different signs in that definition
54912 this question arose because of my first question interpreting vector fields as derivations on physics the point here is if some force is conservative then theres some scalar field which is the potential so that we can write nabla thats fine it says that force is covector but the point is when we start thinking about curved spaces in general instead of talking about gradients and covectors we talk about exterior derivatives and one forms my question then is if force is conservative with potential then its correct do represent the force by the one form obtained by the exterior derivative of the potential in other words the form du in second place if the force isnt conservative is it correct to think of it as one form yet but now whats the interpretation tried to give this interpretation suppose were dealing with some manifold and suppose that vx is coordinate chart then left dx right spans the cotangent space and so if we interpret some force at the point as some one form in ast pm then well have idx using the summation convention now if take some vector in pm we can compute fv idx iv however dx iv and hence fv iv and so my conclusion is if interpret force at point as one form at the point then itll be form that when given vector gives the work done moving particle in the direction of the given vector so if force varies from point to point could represent it as one form field that can be integrated along some path to find the total work done can someone answers those points and tell me if my conclusion is correct
54950 im looking for simple explanation of how whistle operates know that forcing air over sharp lip can set up wave in resonating cavity but how most whistles operate due to feedback mechanism between flow instability and acoustics yes but what does that feedback mechanism look like was surprised to be unable to find basic diagram online demonstrating how whistle operates did find lots of images like this but such images are unhelpful since they dont show exactly whats producing the oscillation
54975 bearing in mind am layman with no background in physics please could someone explain what the big deal is with quantum entanglement used to think understood it that particles say light year apart spatially could affect each other physically instantly here would understand the big deal on further reading ive come to understand maybe incorrectly that the spatially separated particles may not affect each other but in knowing ones properties you can infer the others if that it the case dont see what the big deal is things have some properties set in correlation to each other at the point of entanglement they are separated measured and found to have these properties what am missing is it that the particles properties are in an un set state and only when measured do they get set the wave function collapses if this is true why do we think this instead of the more intuitive thought that the properties were set at an earlier time
54979 wikipedias page on escape velocity puts the escape velocity for an object travelling out of the solar system at 525km this figure is slightly higher than the tentative velocity of voyager at 17km why is the vehicle spoken of as being on an interstellar course when did the vehicle achieve solar escape velocity what am missing

55143 if small black hole say about mm radius or of earths mass came flying along at the speed of comet or higher and impacted the earth what would happen would it pass through the earth and atmosphere with minimal damage would it leave crater entry or exit would it create big enough shock wave to significantly damage the earth would it be captured and wander around inside the earth read book few years ago with this as the primary part of the plot and have wondered about the physics ever since
55204 have seen the term topological charge defined in an abstract mathematical way as essentially labeling scheme for particles which follows certain rules however am left guessing when trying to explain what physical properties of system lead to the need to introduce this new type of charge if it makes any difference im interested in studying the statistical properties of quantum hall systems and in particular anyonic interferometry where the different topological charges contribute to the total number of quantum states

55487 my question is about two equations regarding uniform spheres that ive run into quad frac gm and quad frac frac gm on one hand is unknown to me and is described in solved problems in geophysics as the gravitational potential of sphere of mass also found it online called the potential due to uniform sphere on the other hand is what ive seen before and know it by the descriptions sphere gravitational potential energy or gravitational binding energy my understanding is that is the amount of energy required to build the sphere piece by piece from infinity also recognize gmm as the gravitational potential between two masses can someone explain the difference between these concepts how can gm be the gravitational potential of sphere isnt that what is
55598 technique of vital importance at all levels in physics is estimation this is obvious from the first chapter in any introductory physics textbook but is also related to the working physicist checking orders of magnitudes during research presentations is common practice ive seen many good questions with good followup answers that started with if estimated that value would get something much different in general the actually result is not the interesting thing its what individual things will affect the result there are even famous examples of this fermis piano tuner problem and the drake equation apparently fermi was so good at this that he estimated the size of the trinity nuclear bomb test to within factor of see the wikipedia article for discussion of that in this spirit would like to see someone try and estimate the number of hairs on the human head the answer must include the basic assumptions so we can see where the major unknowns lie and the best answer is one which requires no specific knowledge
55660 my question is if we write einstein field equations in this form mu nu dfrac mu nu pi dfrac mu nu then the left hand side is one statement about the geometry of space time and the right hand side is one statment about the distribution of momentun and energy right my point is what if we use the electromagnetic stress energy tensor as the energy momentum tensor my thought was if understood correctly does this says that electromagnetic fields can also change the geometry of space time making it bend as does the presence of matter sorry if it makes no sense or if its completely nonsense its just thought that came out im just starting to study those things

55751 have doubt about the physical and geometrical interpretation of differential forms ive been studying differential forms on spivaks calculus on manifolds but my real intent is to use those concepts in physics was very amazed when found out that force can be described as form that given vector gives me the work to move particle along the vector cf this phys se post really believe that theres much more use for those concepts in physics for instance writing maxwells equations in more general form the problem with those books like calculus on manifolds is that all the ones ive found dont care too much about the physical and geometrical interpretation of those concepts for instance although they comment about how this fits and geometry and so on its not the focus to justify why forms relates to density and how can this be used to model things in physics what want then is to ask if any of you can recommend be books that explains how those concepts fits in physics how can they be used to give precise descriptions of physical phenomena
55768 we can store cold ice heat hot water bag and electrical charge batteries we can even store magnetic field in magnet we can convert light into energy and then if we want back to light but we cant store light in form of light in significant amounts what is the explanation of that in physics terms
55833 recently stumbled upon this interesting image of wasp floating on water assuming this isnt photoshopped have couple of questions why do you see its image like that whats the physical explanation im sure there is an interesting one why are the spots surrounding the wasps legs circle shaped would they be square shaped if the feet of the wasp were square shaped
56024 is the schrodinger equation invariant under galilean transformations am only asking this question so that can write an answer myself with the content found here http en wikipedia org wiki user likebox schrodinger galilean invariance and here http en wikipedia org wiki user likebox schrodinger galilean invariance learned about these pages in comment to this answer by ron maimon think ron maimon is the original writer of this content this is creative commons so its ok to copy it here it is not on any textbook on non relativistic quantum mechanics that know of and thought it would be more accessible if to no one else at least for myself and safe here hope this type of question is not in disagreement with site policy
56062 when we bring opposite poles of two magnets together they attract each other or vice versa now we can say that the kinetic energy gained by the magnets is due to the attractive force similarly we say in lenzs law that if the north pole of magnet is moved towards solenoid for example then the north of the magnetic field produced by the induced current will be towards the north of the magnet to oppose the change in magnetic flux the explanation we give for the above 2nd paragraph phenomena is the law of conservation of energy now suppose that the opposition is not offered in the above phenomena and the south of the magnetic field produced by the induced current is towards the north pole of magnet the motion of the magnet will be enhanced in this case and the magnitude of change of magnetic flux will increase this is said to be the violation of law of conservation of energy my question is that why is this violation of energy if two opposite poles of magnet can attract each other why not the south of magnetic field of induced current and north of the magnet know its complicated question but thats is the best could do with it will appreciate if anyone could edit it to make it better but dont change the question
56144 my question is pretty brief when two sound waves of nearly same frequencies interfere we get beats but have not observed something like that happening in the case of light in fact most of the light around us is collection of continuous wavelength range which must be all nearly same frequencies can we observe beats in light waves as in case of sound waves if yes how to observe them
56170 got to read volume of feynmanns lectures it said that at absolute zero molecular motion doesnt cease at all because if that happens we will be able to make precise determination of position and momentum of the atom we do know that heisenberg uncertainty principle holds for microscopic particles in motion but what then is wrong to consider that all molecular motion ceases at absolute zero in other words does the uncertainty principle not hold when there is no motion need some help
56202 almost every time somebody talks about atoms at some point they mention something like this if we remove the spaces between the atoms and atomic components we can fit the solar system in thimble or if we remove the spaces between the electrons and the nucleus we can fit the universe in baseball know that atoms are mostly empty but ive always thought that those statements are exaggerating can we really fit the solar system in thimble if we remove all those spaces
56245 we walk or ride on our vehicles to our destinations daily does our movement have any effect on the rotation of the earth according to newtons law what will be the effect if we move all the peoples along with their vehicles at their maximum velocity in one line in one direction along the equator how much effect will it make
56296 understand that the photon needs to have enough energy to produce lepton and its antimatter partner and that all of the properties are conserved but why does the photon do this in the first place whats going on behind the scenes to transform single neutral particle the photon into two charged particles electrons why is the nucleus necessary
56388 this may not be great question but whenever you drain water small whirlpool happens obviously this got me thinking can we model tornados with this effect would it even be beneficial
56496 one of the great unsolved problems in physics is turbulence but im not too clear what the mystery is does it mean that the navier stokes equations dont have any turbulent phenomena even if we solve it computationally or does it mean we simply dont have closed form solution to turbulent phenomena

56956 have question that seems natural in physics and mathematics mainly in statistical mechanics of equilibrium results that are proven by formal mathematical methods that were already seem intuitive results and experimentally verified when proofs by mathematically rigorous methods were obtained in many fields of science most notably physics there are many historical examples that refute this view an example of this type that know is the general theory of relativity and gps the original english acronym for global positioning system it is possible that one may disagree without explaining in detail the formulas of contraction dilation of spacetime which is obtained formally theory of relativity are used to sync properly watch each of the gps satellites with the clocks of point on earth for more see here and here however can not get an explicit example in statistical mechanics that is would an example of resutado first obtained by formal mathematical methods and was discovered by experimental means later question there is exemple of same result in statistical mechanics that was first discovered by theoretical mathematical methods and only later confirmed experimentally question some example explicit or reference for the ising model
57030 why is heisenbergs uncertainty principle not an experimental error since it is the error created by photons striking on elementary particles
57057 why any fermion can be written as combination of two majorana fermions is there any physical meaning in it why majorana fermion can be used for topological quantum computation
57170 the matrix elements of the momentum operator in position representation are langle hat rangle hbar frac partial deltax partial does this imply that langle hat rangle whenever neq is the momentum operator diagonal in position representation know that the momentum operator shouldnt be diagonal in position representation otherwise solving for the eigenergies and eigenfunctions of most hamiltonians would be trivial am obviously confused here need more than just yes no answers to these questions need some explanation or some intuition
57228 my knowledge on this particular field of physics is very sketchy but frequently hear of theoretical graviton the quantum of the gravitational field so guess most physicists assumption is that gravity can be described by qft but find this weird because gravity seems so incredibly different from the other forces yes know weirdness isnt any sort of scientific deduction principle for relative strengths strong force electromagnetic force weak force gravity not only does gravity have vastly weaker magnitude it also has very strange interaction with everything else consider the standard model interactions no particle or field interacts directly with all other fields heck gluons only barely interact with the rest of them so why is it then that anything that has energy everything that exists also has gravitational interaction gravity seems unique in that all particles interact through it then theres the whole issue of affecting spacetime as far as im aware properties such as charge spin color etc dont affect spacetime only the energy related to these properties

57383 in gravitation and cosmology weinberg states the following lambda epsilon alpha lambda zeta beta lambda kappa gamma lambda lambda delta epsilon epsilon zeta kappa lambda propto epsilon alpha beta gamma delta and the argument is that the left hand side must be odd under single permutation of the indices dont see why this is true say interchange alpha leftrightarrow beta lambda epsilon beta lambda zeta alpha lambda kappa gamma lambda lambda delta epsilon epsilon zeta kappa lambda dont see why the above expression must satisfy lambda epsilon beta lambda zeta alpha lambda kappa gamma lambda lambda delta epsilon epsilon zeta kappa lambda lambda epsilon alpha lambda zeta beta lambda kappa gamma lambda lambda delta epsilon epsilon zeta kappa lambda any hint will be appreciated
57390 many introductory quantum mechanics textbooks include simple exercises on computing the de broglie wavelength of macroscopic objects often contrasting the results with that of proton etc for instance this example taken from textbook calculate the de broglie wavelength for proton of kinetic energy mev bullet moving at the pedagogical motivation behind these questions is obvious when the de broglie wavelength is small compared to the size of an object the wave behaviour of the object is undetectable but what is the validity of the actual approach of applying the formula naively of course 100g bullet is not fundamental object of 100g but lattice of some atoms bound by the electromagnetic force but is the naive answer close to the actual one within an order of magnitude or two how does one even calculate the de broglie wavelength for many body system accurately
57397 have been under the impression that chirality is at least in part way to sneak in lorentz invariant version of helicity for particles that mass flip tanedo seems to espouse this view in somewhat cutesy fashion for example though he seems to be using the math rightly mea culpa btw with cute little bee like particles lly eter aul and mu ary in fact tanedo makes this observation is there some property which is equivalent to helicity in the massless limit and all observers in valid reference frames would measure to be the same for given particle the good news is that such property exists it is called chirality so having convinced myself that chirality must somehow manage to remain experimentally independent of helicity since helicity is of course frame dependent imagine my surprise when noticed michael browns comment about helicity suppressing weak decays of the pi pm indeed you see helicity suppressed weak decays of the pi pm you could just as well call it chirality suppression since what is being measured is the rotation between chirality and helicity eigenstates which is the result of the mass term eh someone help me with this even if the various constituent components of such decays are by themselves lorentz independent what good does that do if their relative ratios are dependent on helicity which would then as best can understand it would again make the decay rate of pi pm decay frame dependent im sure im missing something here but honestly dont know what ive been looking for the papers on the original experiments but was hoping someone could point out where my understanding took an um left hand turn
57413 this is funny question but worth answering the distance between the moon and the earth is km the speed of light is km it will take seconds approx for my laser beam to reach the moon will be able to see the spot of my laser beam over the moon

57561 im trying to understand plancks law for the black body radiation and it states that black body at certain temperature will have maximum intensity for the emission at certain wavelength and the intensity will drop steeply for shorter wavelengths contrarily the classic theory expected an exponential increase im trying to understand the reason behind that law and guess it might have to do with the vibration of the atoms of the black body and the energy that they can emit in the form of photons could you explain in qualitative terms whats the reason
57799 based on the bekenstein hawking equation for entropy hasnt the relationship between quantum mechanics and gravity already been established
57871 the actuator of hard drive head consists of two very strong neodymium magnets with an electromagnetic coil between them if you take that apart the magnets attract each other very strongly theres no doubt the field between them is very strong but if you flip them back to back there is no repulsion force there is pretty much nothing while the magnets are very strong on one side they seem completely inert on the other understand how shape of shaped magnet allows it to focus field near the two exposed poles but how does flat rectangular plate manage to keep the field over one flat wide surface and nearly none near the other sorry about the heavy edit but it seems the question got totally muddled with irrelevant discussion about unipolar magnets and possibility or impossibility to remove magnetic field from one side only heavy rephrasing may help edit some photos the magnets stuck together they hold really hard id be unable to just pull them apart but can slide one against the other to separate them the magnets in inert position they dont act on each other at all just like two inert pieces of metal the magnets seem to have two poles located on the surface off center here normal magnet placed against the hard disk magnet centering itself on one side then flipped on another the metal shield seems to act like completely unmagnetized ferromagnetic can stick the normal magnet any way like to it and it doesnt act on another piece of ferromagnetic needle at all when apply small magnet to it it becomes magnetic like any normal soft ferromagnetic attracts the needle weakly it behaves as if the very powerful neodymium magnet glued to the other side wasnt there at all unfortunately the neodymium magnets are glued very well and so fragile was unable to separate any without snapping it and then the special properties seem to be gone
57901 im trying to understand noethers theorem and its application to gauge symmetry below what ive done so far first the global gauge symmetry im starting with the lagragian partial mu psi partial mu psi ast left psi right with classical complex fields this lagragian is invariant with respect to the global gauge symmetry psi rightarrow tilde psi mathbf theta psi such that end up with delta int dv left dfrac delta delta psi delta psi dfrac delta delta psi ast delta psi ast mathbf left psi partial mu psi ast psi ast partial mu psi right partial mu delta theta right int dv left partial mu mu right delta theta provided the equations of motion delta delta psi are valid all along im using that dfrac delta delta phi dfrac partial partial phi partial mu dfrac partial partial left partial mu phi right and that int dv int xdt for short the conserved current is of course mu mathbf left psi ast partial mu psi psi partial mu psi ast right since delta delta theta rightarrow partial mu mu here is my first question is this really the demonstration for conservation of charge up to now it seems to me that only demonstrated that the particle number is conserved there is no charge for the moment then switch to the local gauge symmetry im starting with the following lagrangian left partial mu mathbf qa mu right psi left partial mu mathbf qa mu right psi ast left psi right dfrac mu nu mu nu with mu nu partial mu nu partial nu mu this lagrangian is invariant with respect to the local gauge transformation left tilde psi mathbf varphi leftx right psi leftx right tilde psi ast mathbf varphi leftx right psi ast tilde mu mu partial mu varphi right left psi psi ast mu right then have delta int dv left dfrac delta delta psi delta psi dfrac delta delta psi ast delta psi ast dfrac delta delta mu delta mu right with delta psi mathbf psi delta varphi delta mu partial mu delta varphi such that end up with dfrac delta delta varphi int dv left mathbf psi dfrac delta delta psi partial mu left mu partial nu nu mu right right with mu partial partial mu and nu mu partial partial left partial nu mu right then by application of the equations of motion have partial mu left mu partial nu nu mu right rightarrow partial mu mu since partial mu partial nu nu mu by construction of course the new current is mu mathbf left psi ast left partial mu mathbf qa mu right psi psi left partial mu mathbf qa mu right psi ast right and is explicitly dependent on the charge so it seems to me this one is better candidate for the conservation of charge nb as remarked in http arxiv org abs hep th eq one can also suppose the maxwells equations to be valid mu partial nu nu mu since they are also part of the equation of motion after all ill come later to this point which sounds weird to me and we end up with the same current once again conserved nevertheless still have some troubles indeed if abruptly calculate the equations of motions from the lagrangian end up with for the mu equation of motion mu partial nu nu mu rightarrow partial mu mu by definition of the mu nu tensor so my other questions is there better way to show the conservation of em charge is there something wrong with what did so far why the noether theorem does not seem to give me something which are not in the equations of motions said differently why should use the noether machinery for something which is intrinsically implemented in the lagrangian and thus in the equations of motion for the independent fields is it because my lagrangian is too simple is it due to the multiple boundary terms cancel thanks in advance ps ive the feeling that part of the answer would be in the difference between what high energy physicists call on shell and off shell structure so far never understood the difference thats should be my last question today
58018 recent question product of exponential of operators asked who to proved that the exponentials of operators multiply in same manner as those of scalars if and only if the commutator of the operators is zero as nervxxxs answer there points out the only if part of that theorem isnt true this is clearly correct as nervxxx gives an example of two operators where neq but where remain confused by one point nervxxx gives proof of this theorem using differential equation approach understand that approach can see clearly that it relies on the operators having well defined inverses the counterexample works because neither of those operators is invertible what confuses me is that have also worked out this derivation by expanding the exponentials in their taylor series and matching terms of equal order in each operator when you do this the and terms all cancel out regardless equating the terms containing ab and ba gives the condition for the commutator when try to equate higher order terms dont get any new information as far as can tell every step in that derivation can be reversed so should be getting an if and only if for the original proposition but thats clearly false so whats going wrong can think of two things first there might be an implicit assumption that the operators are invertible dont see where that would be but might be overlooking it second it could be the expansion and term by term equating of the infinite series just because they are equal term by term doesnt mean they are equal that doesnt make whole lot of sense to me either unless am missing something really basic about infinite series
58046 want to write model for estimating incoming solar radiation for specific latitude on earth but am struggling to find an appropriate source which shows the required equations for doing so would anyone be able to provide me with link to where can find equations for estimating solar radiation irradiance given specific cloud cover latitude time of day and day of year
58069 we normally solve the bogoliubov de gennes bdg equations in order to compute the energy spectrum of superconductor the nambu spinor is common object that is used in formulating these equations in other words the problem is formulated with the priori assumption that the superconductors obeys particle hole symmetry but how do we know that it will obey particle hole symmetry im sure that by assuming particle hole symmetry computing the spectrum by solving the bdg equations and comparing with experiments we get good agreement so we know its true just dont understand why that is the case is there any physical reason behind it

59221 why day is divided by hours why the number why not using or or who invented this any physical reasons behind this
59247 this is question that has been gnawing on me for many years now back long time ago as recall in reference to scene in popular science show on tv was asked the following the claim is that when you look out into the universe you see the universe as it appeared at some past time this follows from the speed of light being finite and looking at objects by observing their emitted light or other em radiation the amount of time that one looks backwards is equal to the distance to the observed object in light distance so looking at something ten lightyears away means you are observing it as it was ten years ago matter moves at rate of speed less than the speed of light it has to since matter has mass even if miniscule at the atomic level so mass lt em probably significantly less since em so lets say youre looking at an object lightyears away by observing something for which to the observer that object appears as it was years ago but the earth is much younger than years and we established that matter moves at slower speed than em radiation so wouldnt the radiation that was emitted years ago long since have passed earths current position if say mass times big assumption but bear with me for second it would seem that the radiation emitted years ago would have passed earths current position times times years ago around the time when the solar system was still forming setting mass times which seems more realistic means the radiation would have passed us around times years ago so how could we be observing it now im not sure im posing this question in the best possible way ill admit do find the concept somewhat confusing and im sure that theres simple explanation for it all just what am missing did find is it possible to look into the beginning of the universe which seems peripherally related but not quite the same thing qmechanic brought up seeing cosmic activity now really means it happens millions billions of years ago but that question seems to be about whether it is so not why it is so
59316 humans are heat engines heat engines cant operate when the source and the sink are at the same temperatures and also if the temperature of the sink is higher than that of the source in humans case the source is our body itself technically the mitochondria and the sink is the surrounding so how can people keep on working when the temperature body temperature
59327 an electric field in conductor causes charges to redistribute so as to cancel out the original field bringing the field to zero this is think common argument for why conductors are generally opaque to em waves but some conductors are transparent including various electrolytes and indium tin oxide in lcd displays what are the mechanisms by which conductors can be transparent
59333 the definitions between on and off shell are given in wikipedia why is it so important in qft to distinguish these two notions
59359 after going through several forums became more confused whether it is dc or ac that is more dangerous in my text book it is written that the peak value of ac is greater than that of dc which is why it tends to be dangerous some people in other forums were saying that dc will hold you since it doesnt have zero crossing like that of ac many others also say that our heart tries to beat with the frequency of ac which the heart cannot support leading to peoples death what is the actual thing that matters most after all which is more dangerous ac or dc

59502 does gravity slow the speed that light travels can we actual measure the time it takes light from the sun to reach us is that light delayed as it climbs out of the suns gravity well
59513 yesterday understood what it means to say that the moon is constantly falling from lecture by richard feynman in the picture below there is the moon in green which is orbiting the earth in grey now the moon wants to go at tangent and travel along the arrow coming out of it say after one second it arrives at the red disc due to gravity it falls down toward the earth and ends up at the blue disc the amount that it falls makes it reach the orbital path so the moon is constantly falling into the orbital path which is what makes it orbit the trouble im having is shouldnt the amount of fall travelled by the moon increase over time the moons speed toward the earth accelerates but its tangential velocity is constant so how can the two velocities stay in balance this model assumes that the moon will always fall the same distance every second so is the model wrong or am missing something extra points to whoever explains how come when you do the calculation that feynman does in the lecture to find the acceleration due to gravity on earths surface you get half the acceleration youre supposed to get feynman says that the acceleration is mathrm ft mathrm but its actually twice that
59514 tried to check the lorentz invariance of the standard special relativity action for free particle directly int dt int sqrt dt lorentz boost dt frac dt udx sqrt dx frac udt dx sqrt frac dx dt frac uv substitute these expressions into the action int sqrt left frac uv right dt int sqrt left frac uv right left frac dt udx sqrt right int left frac sqrt left frac uv right sqrt rightdt int left frac sqrt left frac uv right sqrt rightdx but know that action of this type is invariant under lorentz transformations so we want to get that int sqrt dt but it doesnt seem to me that these expressions for action are equal so im confused maybe there is mistake in my calculations
59568 im pretty astounded that did not hear about this sooner but in my course on qft our professor told us that the concept of spin can be used to mean three things mechanical spin apparently relativistic effect giving rise to classical spin orbit coupling magnetic spin purely quantum mechanical classification of representations of the lorentz group the manner in which the particles transforms under lorentz transformations take it that these meanings dont generally coincide since they dont seem to do so in the case of the photon we describe this as spin particle 3rd meaning though it has no intrinsic magnetic moment 2nd meaning however despite being swiftly explained in few words in class cannot remember what exactly the first meaning is about furthermore id like to find out the exact relations between these three meanings as the case of the photon showed the last two at least dont generally seem to coincide can anyone clarify related questions are what is spin as it relates to subatomic particles what are some useful ways to imagine the concept of spin as it relates to subatomic particles is angular momentum truly fundamental what does spin mean exactly spin of particle and spin quantum number why do many people say vector fields describe spin particle but omit the spin part but the answers there dont make the light go on in my head

59710 few days ago noticed im sure we all know this that when talking on the phone you receive the messages few seconds after it is said by the sender so person says hello to person in person as time frame they now finished saying hello and it has started traveling down the telephone wires 3g to tower to the other persons phone and it arrives lets just say second later to person they must wait for their message to send 1s and return 1s 1s is the signal propagation time for each person to get the others message in person bs time frame they say nothing until they hear hello so they wait 1s and hear hello then they respond back with hello person which takes 1s to get there so why do telephone conversations feel like they are happening in real time know this is common sense but want to see it spelled out know the sky is blue but why are person and talking now but the actual information exchange is happen propagation time later

59921 falling object with no initial velocity with mass is influenced by gravitational force and the drag air resistance which is proportional to the objects speed by newton laws this can be written as mg kv ma for low speeds mg kv ma for high speeds assume that is positive constant that depends on the geometry of the object and the viscosity but how can one explain that the air resistance is proportional to the velocity and to the velocity squared in the second equation
59929 the pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions can share identical quantum states bosons one the other hand face no such prohibition this allows multiple bosons to essentially occupy the same space phenomenon that has been theorized responsible for superconductivity bosons do not however occupy exactly the same space as can be readily observed by the fact that bose einstein condensate does not collapse into singularity both of the rather unusual examples cited above are inherent to low energy systems large collection of in diamond does not exhibit particularly unusual behavior this leads me to hypothesize that the energy distribution of the system is largely responsible for keeping bosons apart given the rather basic nature of the question however figured someone here would likely know the correct answer so what keeps bosons from occupying the same location
59945 not sure how to word my question picture light source in vacuum so nothing disturbs the light or similar conditions 2d if move very very far away will it happen that some of the light hits right beside me both left and right but not exactly at where am seeing as there will be fixed number of photons sent away from the light and huge circumference for them to spread they cannot possibly hit every point of the circle if it was person kicking footballs in all directions instead of the light the footballs would hit everywhere on circle with small radius red circle if the radius is bigger the distance between the balls traveling will be greater and there will be gaps between the balls where can stand without being hit red arc im unsure how this would work with light being both like footballs but also wave thanks

60060 ive been studying in optics the macroscopic maxwells equations and how electromagnetic fields propagate through different mediums over there the index of refraction appears as complex function that generally depends on omega with both refraction and absorption terms kappa understand how this affects the speed at which light propagates both macro and microscopically and how this affects to how light is absorbed when it transmits through the medium but dont get yet how this index changes the direction of light producing dispersion mean all time im seeing those effects as something that separates dispersive from non dispersive mediums and all that stuff and dont know how light is actually dispersed as its something that happens when changing medium guess its an interface effect and we havent seen those effects yet but would like to know an explanation
60095 question how hot is the water in the pot more precisely speaking how can get temperature of the water as function of time priori background my attempt recently started spend some time on cooking and im curious about it have learned mathematics as undergraduate student for four years but know little about thermodynamics listened to such lecture once so ive heard of du tds pdv entropy and gibbs energy for example though forgot almost everything anyway think ive never seen formula depending on time so conduct small experiment first heat 100ml of water by ih correspond approximately to 700w and measure its temperature every seconds here is the results it looks almost linear but think linear approximation is inappropriate because if so the water gets higher than circ mathrm so guess its some convex increasing function like tt alpha beta for some positive constant alpha and beta but it doesnt fit the data it does fit the data just made mistake in simple calculation see my answer think ignored too many factors so feel free to assume anything reasonable would greatly appreciate if you help me thank you additional question do experiment and some calculation to deal with problem pointed out in the comments of my answer bad fitting at lower temperature however cannot get better solution fitting seems worse than before here is the results what got heated 100ml water in pot with 9cm radius by ih correspond to 700w for calculation added linear interpolation values in the graph how can get better solution light blue curve is logistic approximation defined by dfrac as mentioned here

60226 in pictures taken from the summit of mount everest such as this one the colour of the sky is very dark blue or even black in some pictures remember from my own experiences of hiking in the himalayas that the sky appeared to be darker blue as climbed higher in shots looking outward from the summit theres very interesting effect of having black sky above with blue sky lower down near the horizon one example here believed that this happens because there is less atmosphere above the climbers to scatter the blue wavelengths however this same black sky effect does not occur when looking out the window of plane as the plane climbs the sky does not appear to change colour at all as the plane ascends the cruising altitude of commercial airliners on an international flight is slightly higher than everest so one would expect the sky to appear quite similar what explains these two observations

60315 propose the following scenario at photon is emitted from star at said photon is received and interpreted by some detector my question is whether or not it is accurate to say that at the photon was emitted at correct angle and time such that it had to have landed in that detector in other words is photon travel deterministic such that if you knew the emission angle of the photon you could determine where the photon should eventually end up its pretty easy to predict where photons will end up on small scales otherwise lasers would be fairly useless but does this ability translate well to cosmic scales assuming we know the exact emission angle
60409 read textbook today on quantum mechanics regarding the pauli spin matrices for two particles it gives the hamiltonian as alpha sigma sigma gamma vec sigma cdot vec sigma where vec sigma and vec sigma are the pauli spin matrices for two particles separately think sigma is the component found that sigma left begin matrix end matrix right which is 2x2 matrix am wondering if the sigma is the same for particle and if so sigma sigma left begin matrix end matrix right is that right the most confusing part is vec sigma cdot vec sigma there are two matrices involved so how does the dot product work am trying solve for the eigenvalues of it looks like to me that each sigma and sigma is 2x2 so there are two eigenvalues is that correct
60422 in the popular culture the xix xx century competition between thomas edison and nikola tesla is well known the example could be the prestige movie where there are some edisons agents who sabotage teslas efforts from electrical engineers point of view the most known problem between them is whether to use dc or ac the war of currents we can say that edison is better known because of the invention of bulb or his first urban electricity system tesla is almost unknown some people say about magic and so on thats why recall the prestige movie in electricity it seems that tesla has won even if hes widely forgotten we use ac mainly because of its easy in transformers we have an si unit text tesla which is for measuring magnetic induction but we cant forget edisons impact on electricity even if he was mostly great businessman no one can say hes done nothing but the bulb here is some list of his patents so why isnt he honored like tesla amp re volta siemens ohm faraday by his own unit in physics

60662 has anyone ever measured the one way speed of photons traveling perpendicular to the earth at the earths surface given our current understanding of physics is there any way both the upward and downward speed would not be if the measurement were made and the downward speed were found to be considerably faster than would there be any plausible explanation given our current understanding of physics if it hasnt been done in the past how would one do so and how difficult would it be to make such measurement in both the upward and downward directions with less than km error bars edit someone helped me find my error on another thread thanks again for all help

60848 charges are transferred by electrons which we all know but why cant it be transferred by protons well searched on google where found similar questions already being asked on many sites however didnt find any answers they were saying that electrons are mobile and similarly protons are busy being nucleons also someone was saying by the simple mechanism of separating two things electrons are pulled out of their fermi energy levels and into conduction band to effect charge transference and the creation of static charge which didnt understand at all

61139 in quantum mechanics we think of the feynman path integral int frac hbar where is the classical action as probability amplitude propagator for getting from to in some time we interpret the expression int frac hbar as sum over histories weighted by frac hbar is there physical interpretation for the weight frac hbar its certainly not probability amplitude of any sort because its modulus squared is one my motivation for asking this question is that im trying to physically interpret the expression langle phix phix rangle frac int frac hbar phix phix int frac hbar
61165 an equipotential surface is one in which all the points are at the same electric potential if charge is to be moved between any two points say from point to point on an equipotential surface according to the formula dw cdot dv the work done becomes zero my question is how to move particle without doing any work
61174 most people can ride km on their bike however running km is lot harder to do why according to the law of conservation of energy bicycling should be more intensive because you have to move higher mass requiring more kinetic energy to reach certain speed but the opposite is true so to fulfill this law running must generate more heat why does it some things can think of as partial answers you use more muscles to run while running you have more friction with the ground continuously pouncing it dissipates energy to it while you move your body at slow speed you need to move your arms and legs alternately at higher and lower speeds
61196 does earth produce metallic elements in its core
61280 take classical field theory described by local lagrangian depending on set of fields and their derivatives suppose that the action possesses some global symmetry what conditions have to be satisfied so that this symmetry can be gauged to give an example the free schr dinger field theory is given by the lagrangian mathscr psi dagger biggli partial frac nabla 2m biggr psi apart from the usual u1 phase transformation the action is also invariant under independent shifts psi to psi theta theta of the real and imaginary parts of psi it seems that such shift symmetry cannot be gauged although cannot prove this claim correct me if am wrong this seems to be related to the fact that the lie algebra of the symmetry necessarily contains central charge so my questions are how is the impossibility to gauge global symmetry related to central charges in its lie algebra ii can one formulate the criterion for gaugability directly in terms of the lagrangian without referring to the canonical structure such as poisson brackets of the generators have in mind lagrangians with higher field derivatives by gauging the symmetry mean adding background not dynamical gauge field which makes the action gauge invariant
61333 as far as know the mass of an observed object increases as it approaches the speed of light is it possible that the excess mass called dark matter is due to relativistic dust surely stars cannot account for that excess mass since we can measure their speeds and they are not relativistic however can we observe and measure the velocity of dust in the galaxy maybe the dust could account for missing matter

61536 so have taken an introductory level quantum physics and am currently taking an introductory level probability class then this simple scenario came up given fair coin that has been tossed times each time landing heads would it be more likely that that the next coin flip be tails or heads can see that since the event is independent by definition then the probability would be even for both heads and tails ph pt but would this differ in quantum mechanical standpoint have feeling that ph pt because of the push towards equilibrium in the entropy of the system am wrong to think this way follow up turning out to be more of statistical problem possibly something the around the equilibrium only exists in the infinite time limit idea is what im getting hitched on the proportion of head to tails is to as number of trails approach infinity this is fact correct therefore if this must be the case mustnt there be an enacting force per say that causes this state of being to admitted unreachable but technically eventual case or is this thought process just illegitimate simple because the state exist on at the infinity case

61579 there are many free fermion systems that possess topological edge boundary states examples include quantum hall insulators and topological insulators no matter chiral or non chiral 2d or 3d symmetry protected or not their microscopic origins are similar explicitly speaking when placing such system on geometry with open boundary in one spatial dimension say the axis and closed boundary in other spatial dimensions the bulk model hamiltonian is always reduced to one or several copies of the following 1d hamiltonian along the open boundary axis direction see zhou et al argument thatprl text 1d partial sigma perp sigma partial perp sigma where sigma are the three pauli matrices and perp denotes the momentum perpendicular to axis and could be extended to matrix in higher dimensions the existence of the topological edge state is equivalent to the existence of edge modes of text 1d on an open chain it was claimed that the edge modes exist when after discretize and diagonalize text 1d was able to check the above statement but my question is that whether there is simple argument that allows one to judge the existence of the edge mode by looking at the differential operator text 1d without really solving the differential equation believe there should be reason if the edge mode is robust ps am aware of but not satisfied with the topological argument that the bulk band has non trivial topology which can not be altered without closing the bulk gap thus there must be edge states on the boundary is it possible to argue from the property of text 1d without directly referring to the bulk topology
61679 ever since reading about the nhmfl have always wondered about this and asked several people without getting good satisfactory answer my question is considering the simplest case lets say uniform magnetic field with very high magnitude constant both in time and space permeating large room what would happen to my body in such field like if was to just walk through it how large would the magnitude need to be before feel anything one tesla is fairly large would feel anything imagine as we crank up the magnitude would feel queasy and sick what if crank it up to fifty teslas or hundred teslas would it hurt would it mess up my synaptic potentials would go crazy with dysfunctional brain would pass out or go into coma at what point will the damage become irreversible what magnitude will cause death with high enough magnitude would molecules in my body start falling apart what happens at hundreds of teslas thousands of teslas or millions of teslas the closest thing here found was here in the accepted answer magnetar that would be miles away would kill us due to diamagnetism of water in our cells this is the kind of stuff am looking for the magnitude of the field and then its effect on human body like at 100t your body would because and at 1000t your body would because and so on if we allow changes in the magnetic field in time does the induced electric field hasten the effects somehow would strong enough field cause shock within us burning our organs and killing us even if the average field is small but the db dt is large for example dont know if any experiments on biological samples have been done because artificially creating magnetic fields beyond 100t or so hasnt been quite done yet much less sustaining them and observing the effects on biological tissue but if there are any cool references even if they are on theoretical grounds that would be interesting thanks edit just to make the question more answerable ill focus only on static fields anyone know of any references experiments regarding the effects of large magnetic fields on biological tissues
61699 it is said in many textbooks that alpha decay involves emitting alpha particles which are very stable indeed the binding energy mev is higher than for neighboring stable isotopes but the binding energy is lower than for example mathrm be mev my question is why arent other nuclear compounds ejected from heavy nuclei mathrm be the gamow factor frac pi hbar frac ze pi epsilon frac alpha decreases exponentially in so it explains intuitively why lower particles would tunnel more often specifically it would explain why we would see mathrm be emission simeq times as often compared to mathrm he emission also the particles need to form in the nucleus prior emissions but with similar binding energy per nucleon mev for mathrm he vs mev for mathrm be and higher total binding energy for the mathrm be nucleus would expect that its formation in the same order of prevalence as the alpha particle according to ohanian between and alpha particles are in existence at any moment in time can anyone explain this reference to an article textbook would be preferable edit same goes for mathrm which is also double magic isotope as anna pointed out for it the gamow factor is smaller by simeq and emission should still be viable

61810 know perfectly well how to derive the magnitude of the electric field near conductor frac sigma varepsilon and near sheet of charge frac sigma varepsilon in fact can explain with clarity each step of the derivation and understand why is one two times larger than the other but heres what bothers me when try to think about it purely intuitively whatever the heck that actually means find it difficult to accept that planar charge distribution with the same surface density can produce different field why should it care whether theres conductor behind it or not repeat understand gauss law and everything formally required but want to understand where my intuition went wrong edit thanks to you people developed my own intuition to deal with this problem and im happy with it you can see it posted as an answer
61899 firstly think shades of this question have appeared elsewhere like here or here hopefully mine is slightly different take on it if im just being thick please correct me we always hear about the force of gravity being the odd one out of the four forces and this argument whenever its presented in popular science at least always hinges on the relative strength of the forces or for more in depth picture this excellent thread but having had single brief semester studying general relativity im struggling to see how it is viewed as force at all force as understand it involves the interaction of matter particles with each other via field an energy quantisation of the field is the force carrying particle of the field in the case of gravity though particles dont interact with one another in this way general relativity describes how space time is distorted by energy so what looked to everyone before einstein like two orbiting celestial bodies bound by some long distance force was actually two lumps of energy distorting space time enough to make their paths through 3d space elliptical yet theorists are still very concerned with uniting the forces even though that pesky 4th force has been well described by distortions in space time is there reason for this that is understandable to recent physics graduate like myself my main points of confusion why is gravity still viewed as force is the interaction of particles with space time the force like interaction is space time the force field if particles not experiencing em weak strong forces merely follow straight lines in higher dimensional space what understand geodesics to be then how can there be 4th force acting on them thanks to anyone who can help shed some light on this for me
61918 if light is passed through two polarizing filters before arriving at target and both of the filters are oriented at to each other then no light will be received at the target if third filter is added between the first two oriented at angle as shown below light will reach the target why is this the case as understand it polarized filter does nothing except filter out light it does not alter the light passing through in any way if two filters exist that will eliminate all of the light why does the presence of third which should serve only to filter out additional light actually act to allow light through
62008 lets assume have spaceship in front of me lets say at 1000000km distance now lets assume have also stationary wall just behind the spaceship at 999999km initially the spaceships speed is now lets accelerate the spaceship rapidly to relativistic speeds due to the length contraction the spaceship and its distance from me contracts now see paradoxical situation and the wall is in the same frame of reference from the walls point of view the spaceship come closer to the wall momentarily and zips away from my point of view the spaceship can come closer to me than the wall due to length contraction rate effectively smacking into the wall during the acceleration how to resolve this apparent paradox or where is the origin of the contraction
62056 have professor that is fond of saying that vorticity cannot be destroyed see how this is true for inviscid flows but is this also true for viscous flow the vorticity equation is shown below for reference from this equation it looks as if vorticity only convects and diffuses this would suggest that it cant be destroyed frac boldsymbol omega dt boldsymbol omega cdot nabla boldsymbol nu nabla boldsymbol omega however consider this thought experiment suppose we have closed container filled with water with initial vorticity field boldsymbol omega at time if the container is allowed to sit undisturbed as to infty the water will become stationary boldsymbol to with zero vorticity boldsymbol omega to this suggests vorticity can be destroyed my professor claims the boundary layer vorticity at the sides of the container is equal and opposite in sign to the bulk vorticity if this is the case the vorticity cancels out after long time resulting in the stationary fluid and vorticity is not destroy just cancelled out edit im looking for either proof that the boundary layer vorticity is equal and opposite to the bulk vorticity or counter explanation or proof im using proof in very loose hand wavy sense

62343 have been recently brushing up on my elementary physics concepts specifically quantum physics if set up single photon emitter and conducted the double slit experiment it is possible for me to see interference when thought about this realized that photon is mass less and travels at the speed of light so time does not affect photon therefore photon can interact with another instance of itself which in our frame of reference exists in another time my question is is this same effect observable when single electron is fired at speeds much lower than the speed of light if so how for this to happen the electron which has mass and experiences time the way we do has to be physically present at two locations at the same time in both slits
62513 lot of text books mention that one of the reasons that classical mechanics failed to explain atomic and subatomic processes is that electrons which accelerate should release energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation which would lower the atoms overall energy level but this does not happen one place where discovered this for example is in the description for the bohr model what dont understand is why everyone takes for granted the fact that the electron is accelerating thought the electron orbits the nucleus at more or less constant velocity are people referring to specific situations when the atom is excited furthermore was under the impression that electrons already travel at the fastest allowable speed the speed of light

62888 im trying to get to grips with the schr dinger equation by looking at free particle im certain at some point massively misunderstood something according to textbook and lecture the free particle moving in positive direction can be described by psixt ikx omega psix cdot omega classically would expect the particle to move along its path with some constant velocity so would like to determine the probability px delta xt to find the particle between and delta at time in order to compare it with the classical location xt cdot since im looking for location have to use the trivial location operator hat and get px delta xt int delta psixt hat psixt dx int delta psixt psixt dx int delta ikx omega ikx omega dx int delta dx delta which doesnt make sense to me at all since it doesnt depend on either or the particle is not at all locations along the axis with the same probability at all times would rather expect it to move along the axis with the velocity but regardless which constants shove into by using normalisation constraints will never depend on but according to my understanding it should obviously my understanding is wrong and or made some mistakes in my calculation where am going wrong
62980 one would like to motivate the classical partition function in the following way in the limit that the spacing between the energies generally on the order of becomes small relative to the energies themselves one might write quantum sum beta stackrel rightarrow int beta de which is clearly wrong on dimensional grounds but illustrates the idea yet this is not of the same form as the classical partition function namely classical frac 3n int beta bf bf bf bf so one might look for measure lambda to append to the quantum partition function such that lim lambda rightarrow sum beta lambda frac 3n int beta bf bf bf bf does such measure exist or is there an alternate procedure for deriving the classical partition function from the quantum one
63045 have been studying causality specifically why there is no such thing as simultaneous instant of time across all observers recently and keep hearing references to the andromeda paradox can anyone tell me what it is and how it is resolved ive tried reading what wikipedia says about it but could really use someones explanation edit ok after reading the related question now id like to know does this imply there is some sort of privileged reference frame in which there exists absolute velocity and absolute time ask because the answer for the other question seemed to indicate that the actions seem to be at different points of simultaneity but that in fact the person not moving is getting it right but this seems strange to me because if we accelerated our galaxy to different speed we would still perceive our stationary observer as being right even though theyd see something different than before the acceleration so who is right in what frame can we be sure that our present is andromedas present
63070 there are two kinds of time dilation one because the other clock moves fast relative to me special relativity another one because the other clock is in stronger gravitational field general relativity or accelerating rapidly equivalence principle so are these two effects are totally independent is it possible to derive the general relativity case from the special relativity case
63163 inspired by my previous question questions about angular momentum and dimensional3d space and another relevant question how to define angular momentum in other than three dimensions now get another question in classical mechanicscm for dimensional space the orbital angular momentum an antisymmetric tensor is defined as ij ip jp where ij in qm after canonical quantization the orbital angular momentum ij become some hermitian operators and satisfy the following commutation relations ij kl delta jk li delta li kj delta jl ik delta ik jl tag and as we know in qm 3d angular momentum xs ys is called spin only if ss mathbb where mathbb is the identity operator so in qm more generally can we define dimensional spin ij ij where ij is an antisymmetric tensor and are hermitian operators which satisfy eqn further more sum ij real number times mathbb by the way more questions concerning the definition of rotation groups for angular momentum can be found here who are interested in may have look thanks

63278 so if understood correctly schr dingers cat is thought experiment that puts cat inside box and theres mechanism that kills the cat with probability based on quantum process the argument is that the cat now must be in superposition of dead and alive this makes sense at first but the state of the cat inside the box will affect the outside world in an observable way right for example if the cat dies it might meow loudly which would be audible if it didnt meow it would produce thud on the ground when it dies and even if the ground was very solid the redistribution of mass inside the box will affects its gravity field which means the whole universe theoretically immediately observes the cats death so extending this argument to all superpositions the different states would cause different effects on the rest of the universe usually slight change in the gravity field is the minimum this gravity perturbation would propagate throughout the universe and even all the experimenters go to sleep with thick thick earplugs somebody or something in the universe is going to inadvertently observe the event and the superposition immediately collapses thus superpositions cannot exist beyond an extremely short amount of time whats wrong with my reasoning

63558 this is really bugging me when you look up some educational text about stars life this is what you find out gravity creates the temperature and pressure to start fusion reactions the fusion proceeds to heavier and heavier cores ending with iron which remains in the centre of the star one moment all light cores are depleted and the gravity wins over the power of the fusion reactions now absent the core of the star collapses into high density object which may vary depending on the star mass and the top layers of the star explode and just cannot find clear explanation why according to what imagine the top layers of the star should just fall into the collapsing core is that because of the 3rd newtons rule or do the stars have some need to end with cool boom

63987 know that when electricians work on the poles on the streets if they only touch one wire at time they will be fine however from my understanding the negative wire is connected to large negative terminal and the positive wire to large positive terminal now for example if you touch the positive wire wouldnt all of the electrons get stripped away from your body another way to look at it is that current always flows from higher to lower potential if the potential in the wire is 100v have no idea what it is and your potential is wouldnt current flow through you

64124 dont understand why we are able to see and measure curvature warping of space at all space as understand it determines distances between objects so if space were compressed or warped shouldnt distances be compressed or warped the same way like crumpling up sheet of paper then however our units of measure and frames of reference should be compressed likewise so that there should not be any visible changes to our cognition this would also rule out warp drives unless they form some wormhole in hyper space analogous to two points touching each other on the crumpled sheet of paper what am missing

64555 have never understood whats the meaning of the sentence rolling without slipping let me explain ill give an example yesterday my mechanics professor introduced some concepts of rotational dynamics when he came to talk about spinning wheels he said something like if the wheel is rolling without slipping whats the velocity of the point at the base of the wheel it is zero convince yourself that the velocity must be zero since if it wasnt zero the wheel wouldnt be rolling without slipping so the wheel is rolling without slipping if and only if the point at the base has velocity zero if and only if the tangential speed equals the speed of the center of mass well what really dont understand is this is the rolling without slipping condition defined as point at the base has zero speed if not whats the proper definition for that kind of motion looking across the internet have found more or less the same ideas expressed in the quotation furthermore if it was definition then it would be totally unnecessary to say convince yourself and improper to talk about necessary and sufficient conditions id like to point out that im not really confused about the mathematics behind this or with the meaning of the condition above what puzzles me is why are those explanations always phrased as if the condition where is the relative velocity beetween the point at base and the surface is some necessary and sufficient condition to be rolling without slipping seems to me that this is exactly the definition of rolling without slipping and not an iff any help is appreciated thanks

65068 from my limited experience with ham radio when was kid expect transmitting and receiving antennas to have lengths that are on the same order of magnitude as the wavelength and in fact recall having to mess around to compensate for the fact that given antenna wouldnt be properly resonant over an entire frequency band this also seems to match up with what we see with musical instruments where saxophones tube is half wavelength and clarinets is quarter for commercial fm radio with frequency of mhz the wavelength is about so can believe that some of the receiving antennas ive seen are half wave or quarter wave but for am radio at khz the wavelength is which is obviously not practical length for receiving antenna can anyone explain this in physics terms hopefully without making me break out my copy of jackson and wade through pages of spherical harmonics does am reception suffer from the length mismatch by being less efficient does it benefit from it because its so far off resonance that the frequency response is even across the whole band is there dipole approximation thats valid for am only for both am and fm if the sensitivity is suppressed for the too short antenna is there some simple way to estimate the suppression factor by assuming breit wigner shape for resonance this question touched on this issue but only tangentially and the answers actually seem inconsistent with the observed facts about am also related but not identical radio communication and antennas
65084 relativity can be developed without coordinates laurent sr winitzski gr would normally define vector by its transformation properties its something whose components change according to lorentz transformation when we do boost from one frame of reference to another but in coordinate free approach we dont talk about components and vectors are thought of as immutable for example laurent describes an observer using timelike unit vector and then for any other vector he defines and uniquely by tu where is orthogonal to the tr pair is what we would normally think of as the coordinate representation of in these approaches how do you define vector and how do you differentiate it from things like scalars pseudovectors rank tensors or random objects taken from something that has the structure of vector space but that in coordinate dependent descriptions would clearly not transform according to the lorentz transformation it seems vacuous to say that vector is something that lives in the tangent space since what we mean by that is that it lives in vector space isomorphic to the tangent space and any vector space of the same dimension is isomorphic to it edit im not asking for definition of tangent vector im asking what criterion you can use to decide whether certain object can be described as tangent vector for example how do we know in this coordinate free context that the four momentum can be described as vector but the magnetic field cant my normal answer would have been that the magnetic field doesnt transform like vector it transforms like piece of tensor but if we cant appeal to that definition how do we know that the magnetic field doesnt live in the tangent vector space bertel laurent introduction to spacetime first course on relativity sergei winitzki topics in general relativity https sites google com site winitzki index topics in general relativity
65141 in physics papers would it be correct to say that when there is mention of generators they really mean the generators of the lie algebra rather than generators of the lie group for example ive seen sources that say that the sun group has generators but actually these are generators for the lie algebra arent they is this also true for representations when we say field is in the adjoint rep does this typically mean the adjoint rep of the algebra rather than of the gauge group
65208 in many artistic impressions or movies there are pictures or scenes where the sky is filled with an enormous moon as seen from planet or vice versa wonder if there is an upper limit to the apparent size when viewed with the naked eye no tele lens since the roche limit forbids celestial bodies coming too close to each other there certainly is limit to the apparent size
65229 temperature in an isolated system is defined as frac frac partial sevn partial but wonder how one can generalize this to random system or for instance to point in system because in these books about statistical physics they talk often about temperature gradients in system but for these to exist temperature has first to be defined in every point although cant find general definition hope someone can help me out
65237 im newbie with physics but im wondering how ray of light can essentially be represented have always known that ray of light proceeds in straight line until it encounters another object or material that refracts reflects it but light ray should be part of an electro magnetic wave is this correct if it is so it should obey to the wave equation and this doesnt seem to me to describe straight line ray im having problems visualizing how light is emitted and how it relates with the wave equation can someone with clear understanding of the problem explain it to me in simple terms
65339 lets consider it case by case case charged particle is at rest it has an electric field around it no problem that is its property case charged particle started moving its accelerating we were told that it starts radiating em radiation why what happened to it what made it do this follow up question suppose charged particle is placed in uniform electric field it accelerates because of electric force it experiences then work done by the electric field should not be equal to change in its kinetic energy right it should be equal to change in energy it has radiated in the form of em waves but then why dont we take energy radiated into consideration when solving problems im tutoring grade students never encountered problem in which energy radiated is considered how do moving charges produce magnetic field

65608 to get from point to river will take path that is pi times longer than as the crow flies think this result is from einstein what is the proof of this and how well does it hold water against experiment what assumptions are made during the proof edit was also sceptical when first heard this asking this question in part to potentially mythbust to be clear assumed that the statement was for river that is formed in the usual way on flat plain under usual conditions whatever those are assume the conditions of princeton as einstein was possibly involved as the arc length of the river from starting point tends to infinity frac text arc length text crows length rightarrow pi am aware this is equivalent to the hypothesis that the meandering of the river can be well approximated as semi circular as the length increases above certain value
65647 have question about basic statics but somehow cannot manage to find the answer on my own btw this is not homework its been so many years since school for me the problem is very simple we have an object with weight at given location on table wit with four legs to what is the force applied on each leg for simplicity im just using the same labels and for both the location and the force and are given to find the forces on each leg as far as remember have to consider two general equations sum and sum so have also considering the moments round the point wf xd hf yd but this just give me equations missing one more equation and cannot figure it out

65688 in special relativity the lorentz group is the set of matrices that preserve the metric lambda eta lambda eta is there any equivalent in general relativity like lambda lambda we could at least take locally approx eta so we recover the lorentz group but dont know whether we could extend this property globally why does group theory have much less importance in general relativity than in qft and particle physics
65711 when an atom lases it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light why does this happen how can this be explained how does the photon generated because of stimulated emission know which direction to take what are the factors leading to this
65751 always thought that these two terms are some kind of synonyms meaning that if you have self similar or scale invariant system you can zoom in or out as you like and you will always see the same picture physics but now have just read in the context of lattice of spins model for example that if the system is at its critical point and therefore scale invariant it does not mean that it is self similar as naively discribed in the first paragraph of this question the author of the paper am reading even calls it false picture on later on on he explains that poles on the positive real axis on the so called borel plane break self similarity because lead to tha fact that to obtain the effective action for lambda phi bare action the scale dependent non perturbative power correction terms have to be kept so if scale invariance and self similarity are not exactly the same the explanation for breaking of scale invariance should be slightly and subtly different now am confused and my question simply is what exactly is the difference between scale invariance and self similarity if any
65784 ladder operators are found in various contexts such as calculating the spectra of the harmonic oscillator and angular momentum in almost all introductory quantum mechanics textbooks and every book have consulted starts by defining the ladder operators this makes me wonder why do these operators have their respective forms why is the ladder operator for the harmonic oscillator hat sqrt frac omega hbar left hat frac omega hat right and not something else on similar note does anyone know the physicist paper who which proposed this method wikipedia mentions dirac but have been unable to find any leads

65812 it is well known that prism can split light by separating different frequencies of light many sources state that the reason this happens is that the index of refraction is different for different frequencies this is known as dispersion my question is about why dispersion exists is frequency dependence for refraction property fundamental to all waves is the effect the result of some sort of non linearity in response by the refracting material to electromagnetic fields are there theoretically any materials that have an essentially constant non unity index of refraction at least for the visible spectrum
65825 was always under the impression that lightning rod worked to protect building by being the tallest part of the building and having low path of resistance to the ground thus being good target for lightning to hit reducing the chances of lightning strikes elsewhere on the building however when reading an ars technica article one comment from user malor said that theory is incorrect and explained that lightning rod actually prevents lightning strikes in the first place lightning happens when really huge negative charge builds up in the ground corresponding to positive charge overhead and the differential becomes sufficient to jump the gap and as others are pointing out repeatedly air is an excellent insulator so it takes whacking huge voltage differential to make the arc lightning rod doesnt exist to provide spot for the lightning to strike rather it exists to dissipate the charge so that the strike never happens at all this comes from early experiments with the leyden jar if pointed metal rod was attached to the jar it wouldnt charge the electrons are able to leap off pointed tip and into the air dissipating charge as fast as it accumulates the lightning rod does the same thing on larger scale it spits out electrons into the air like crazy so that the charge wont build up sufficiently and the lightning never hits at all now if the charge accumulates faster than the rod can dissipate it there can still be lightning strike and the rod typically is the best route to ground but everything around the rod is going to take hell of jolt anyway including most likely your electronics lightning rod getting hit means it failed to work adequately ideally it should never be hit at all how does lightning rod actually work does lightning rod actually prevent lightning strikes

66092 if our lagrangian is invariant under local symmetry then by simply restricting our local symmetry to the case in which the transformation is constant over space time we obtain global symmetry and hence corresponding noether charge because however this noether charge didnt come from just any old symmetry but in fact local symmetry we might be able to say something special about it in particular believe that the noether charge should vanish but dont know why if this is indeed the case how do we prove it note that dont want to make the assumption that local gauge non physical
66169 assuming that the earth is spherical that its temperature is continuous and that some other more or less realistic conditions hold we might think that the earths core temperature should be about the average of its surface temperatures this is not the case as the core is hotter than all but few spots on the surface can someone explain where the assumptions break down is it that the temperature is not static
66234 what is the proof without leaving the earth and involving only basic physics that the earth rotates around its axis by basic physics mean the physics that the early physicists mustve used to deduce that it rotates not relativity
66249 so was considering the following problem within the context of special relativity given an object with initial velocity undergoing constant acceleration at rate of want to express the velocity as function of time so from newtonian mechanics velocity initial velocity acceleration time however this makes no sense in context of special relativity since it suggests that given particular acceleration and enough time it is possible to exceed the speed of light what realized needed was mapping from newtonian velocity to its special relativistic equivalent which derived as follows kinetic erel text rel kinetic enewt text newt where text rel relativistic velocity text newt newtonian velocity rest mass speed of light setting both equal to each other and dividing by find that frac left1 frac text rel right frac frac text newt adding to both sides and raising to the power find frac left1 frac vrel right frac frac text newt multiplying both sides by squaring both sides subtracting multiplying by and taking the square root now have text rel cdot left1 frac text newt right frac so given velocity from newtonian problem ex can convert to its energy equivalent in special relativity via this formula note that as newtonian velocity goes to infintiy relativistic velocity approaches and at both quantities are given this framework know for fact from earlier that newtonian velocity is given as vinitial at or using our previously defined units at therefore the relativistic velocity can be expressed as text rel cdot left1 frac 2v at right frac is this correct
66268 so was thinking about something for the past while consider large spherical foam ball with homogeneous density where foam ball is defined as an object that can absorb matter with friction example gravitational well without an object inside this is purely theoretical construct if the foam ball has radius and charge what charge must the foam ball have such that there is well defined sphere or horizon such that any object with negative charge even if it is the slightest bit must travel faster than in order to escape the field of the ball aka what charge would turn this into black hole for all objects with opposite sign on their charge once again assume the foam ball is single particle that doesnt repel itself its just very large homogenous thing with charge
66276 happened to hear people saying that the nuclear fusion bomb tests could set the atmosphere on fire have some serious doubts about that but have no facts nuclear fusion reaction requires kelvins to start if we produce such temperature in open air would the atmosphere become fuel for further fusion shouldnt the whole thing just be torn apart by its terrible pressure
66350 the tensor of moment of inertia contains six off diagonal matrix elements which vanish if we choose reference frame aligned with the principal axes of the rotating rigid body the angular momentum vector is then parallel to the angular velocity but while considering the general case what are the off diagonal moment of inertia matrix elements that is do they have any physical significance as say the components of vector or is it merely mathematical construction with no definite physical meaning which seems rather wrong to me similar thread exists here but they are more interested in the principal axes of the body it also says the physical significance of the off diagonal components is that youre using coordinate system not aligned with the principal directions of the object they tell us nothing interesting about the object itself is that all or is there more to it perhaps related to properties of tensors in general
66498 yesterday read that we can affect the path and the form particle or wave of photon after the fact wheelers delayed choice experiment part of what is puzzling me is the beam splitter are the individual photons actually being split into two new photons of lesser energy this question implies that you cannot split photon but it seems that beam splitters do exactly that

66531 as understand it gravity is inherent to mass and therefore even small rock has its own gravitational pull it seems entirely plausible then that rock in diameter could orbit bigger rock say in diameter is this actually possible are there any practical limits on the size of objects that could have another object orbiting them what kind of environment would be necessary to facilitate something like this occurring could it happen in high or low earth orbit would it have to be far away from any stars planets or other large bodies it seems to me that the speed of the objects would have to be very very slow have no background in physics and dont know ton of math so answers without lot of complicated equations would be appreciated thanks

66834 cant figure out how many different spin states can create with four electron system think can create spin zero state three spin one states and five spin two states that gives me nine possible states altogether my problem is that can specify maximum of eight complex numbers to completely describe the spin states of the four electrons but the nine spin states can seemingly create correspond to the spherical harmonic functions and know for sure that they are linearly independent it seems very wrong this discrepancy in the counting doesnt appear until you get to four electrons it gets worse as you add more electrons does anyone else have problem with this edit thanks for the excellent answers especially from lagerbeer it turns out was even more messed up than thought was dont run into trouble with four electrons im already in trouble with three didnt realize it because was counting 2n electron parameters instead of so had parameters to describe electron spin as opposed to as people have pointed out and this has to relate to lm spin states of so theres already problem with three electrons and it boils down to this you have two different states with axis spin the are and to make them up from electrons you have at your disposal these three states duu udu uud the obvious thing to do is add the three together and of course normalize and believe when you do you get the state the question is how do you create the state think know the answer and ive posted it on my blog anyone want to take stab at it
66851 based on the laws of thermodynamics shouldnt it be theoretically impossible for non plug in hybrid vehicle to ever be more fuel efficient than vehicle that connects the same engine directly to the wheels without converting it into electricity first the only energy input on non plug in hybrid is the gas tank and therefore any energy leaving the vehicle in the form of torque must have originated in that tank when the vehicle is driven electrical energy leaves the battery and is converted into kinetic energy by the motors once the battery is depleted the gasoline engine begins turning converting chemical energy into kinetic energy which turns the wheels directly as well as turning an alternator which converts the kinetic energy into electrical energy charging the battery but since all this energy is no matter what coming from that gas tank it really doesnt matter what form its in when its turned towards moving the vehicle it still started out as the same amount of chemical energy furthermore no conversion of energy can ever be one hundred percent efficient some is inevitably lost to heat and other forms of unusable energy so chemical kinetic electrical kinetic will always be less efficient than chemical kinetic the only ways can think of hybrid being more efficient is through energy recovery the regenerative breaking system turns kinetic energy back into electrical instead of turning it into heat and wasting it like in normal brakes but will the energy recovered by this method ever be greater than the energy lost by the extra conversions as well as the increase inertia from the heavy components

67983 have been reading penroses paper titled relativistic symmetry groups where the concept of conformal compactification of space time is discussed my other references have been this and this in case you cannot see the paper above let me describe what understand so far the idea of conformal compactification is to bring points at infinity on non compact pseudo riemannian manifold equipped with metric to finite distance in new metric by conformal rescaling of the metric tilde omega this is done so that tilde can be isometrically embedded into compact domain tilde of another possibly non compact pseudo riemannian manifold this allows us to discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the manifold under consideration in the references above they mention the following without explanation then observe that any regular extension of phi omega to the conformal boundary partial tilde subset must vanish on said boundary this reflects the property of conformal compactification that brings infinity to finite distance this do not understand firstly what is meant by conformal boundary secondly why should omega on the conformal boundary is there any good reference for this material

68108 wikipedia says in relativity theory proper acceleration is the physical acceleration measurable acceleration as by an accelerometer experienced by an object and says in the standard inertial coordinates of special relativity for unidirectional motion proper acceleration is the rate of change of proper velocity with respect to coordinate time why coordinate time as far as know the moving observer itself measures the proper things its clock measures proper time its speedometer measures proper velocity so if the observer accelerates with 10m and feels that proper acceleration isnt the speed shown by the local speedometer changes 10m per second on the local clock

68381 one of the problems with bohrs theory to describe the hydrogen atom was that the electron orbiting around the nucleus has an acceleration therefore it radiates and loses energy until it would collapse with the nucleus now schr dinger describes the electron as wave function his theory is able to describe all atoms in contrast to bohrs model but how is the radiation problem solved understand that the wave has not an exact position in the time anymore but the electron still moves so it has an acceleration anyway because of vibrations or so why is in this theory the electron not radiating anymore and if it is why doesnt the atom collapse
68398 in basic quantum mechanics courses one describes the evolution of quantum mechanics chronologically interference experiments with particles showed that particles should have wave character on the other hand the photo electric effect showed that electromagnetic waves should have particle character so theres particle wave duality the course continues with postulating the schr dinger equation and solves the problems for the wave character of classical particles with respect to harmonic oscillators to solve the uv catastrophe in the description of blackbody radiation on the other hand one describes the photo electric effect extensively with perturbation theory as the electromagnetic wave acts as periodical force on an electron but the electromagnetic wave is still described with the maxwell equations and not by schr dinger suppose history went little differently the corpuscular character would still be the generally accepted behaviour of light as newton preferred and one discovered the wave character of photons and electrons simultaneously by doing interference experiments the laws of maxwell gauss faraday and amp re werent discovered yet schr dinger comes up with his equation and one describes the wave character of electrons as well as photons with this equation would this equation give exhaustive description of the electromagnetic and vector like behaviour of photons in other words is the schr dinger theory in some way equivalent to the maxwell theory for the description of photons or are the maxwell equations some kind of limit for greater dimensions like the newton equations for mechanics what is the link between these two wave character descriptions of photons

68829 can anyone tell me how to solve this problem alpha centauri is light years away from earth what speed would spaceship headed towards alpha centauri had to have in order to last text years for passanger onboard the only thing know how to do is to determine the proper time which is the one measured on spaceship boxed equiv tau dont know how to calculate any other variable if dont know gamma or think should get system of equations and bust out of there but just cant solve this after hours of trying edit know equations for time dilation length contraction begin align delta gamma delta xleftarrow text time dilation delta gamma delta xleftarrow text length contraction end align and lorenz transformations begin align delta gamma delta delta delta gamma delta delta delta gamma left delta delta frac right delta gamma left delta delta frac right end align
68841 work on drilling rig as roughneck and we had lecture today at the office about mechanical advantage in pulley systems now know that my boss is well educated in oil drilling but my instincts tell me that he may have this one wrong drilling rig works sort of like crane in that it has tall structure supporting pulley system there is large winch permanently installed on the base platform and then it goes over the top of the structure the crown of the derrick and down through floating sheave this has few wraps to give us more mechanical advantage am including pictures to help describe the situation here the picture shows the floating sheave the blocks which we use to do most all of our operations most importantly we use it to pick up our string of pipe that is in the ground as seen in this picture the blocks hold the weight of the string of pipe now he told us that if the pipe get stuck in the hole maybe it snags something or the hole caves in that we lose all of our mechanical advantage he said that is why the weight indicator will shoot up and go back down after it is freed he said that because when the pipe is snagged in the hole then we are not dealing with free floating sheave anymore and that is what is required to have mechanical advantage disagree with this because even if it is not free there is still mechanical advantage such that say the normal mechanical advantage is to our pulling force is multiplied by would like somebody to confirm this for me first picture taken from www worldoils com on june second picture taken from www paysonpetro com on june
68961 if have big ball of 20000000kg and another of 100g does it mean that the big ball will pull the small ball towards it
69013 am attempting to settle friendly bet would pendulum swing indefinitely in hypothetical vacuum no air resistance having hypothetical frictionless bearing no energy lost due to friction assuming the following the frictionless vacuum is on earth the pendulum is already in motion and no other external forces other than gravity act on the pendulum
69080 in special relativity the energy of free particle is 2c 2c but what would be the energy when there is potential energy if its something like sqrt 2c 2c what does it mean if particle has zero or less energy addendum the potential momentum is used only in gauge theories like em but could it be used in sr newtons gravity without introducing the concept of curvature gr
69133 this question may sound bit dumb why cant we obtain the hamiltonian of system simply by finding dot in terms of and then evaluating the lagrangian with dot dot wouldnt we obtain then lagrangian expressed in terms of and why do we need to use ht dot lt dot or is it that whatever the lagrangian is the method of finding dot dot tqp will give us that equation for
69134 this is very layman level question watch lot of documentaries thats my only qualification have seen in documentaries that gamma rays have an extraordinary penetrating power so if we could have gamma ray gun on one end of planet jupiter and something analogous to an ray film of the other end would it be possible to take an ray can or is this penetrating property of gamma rays being used in science
69178 the hamiltonian of tight binding model reads sum limits ij dagger why is there negative sign in the hopping term
69289 wondered if someone could help me understand spontaneous symmetry breaking ssb in classical mechanics quantum mechanics and quantum field theory consider higgs like potential with local maximum surrounded by degenerate ground state pencil balanced on its point for example classical mechanics cm exhibits spontaneously symmetry breaking if and only if the system is perturbed quantum mechanics qm exhibits no symmetry breaking because the ground state is superposition of the degenerate vacua quantum field theory qft at infinite volume spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs because the degenerate vacua are orthogonal langle theta prime theta rangle delta theta prime theta ground state is chosen q1 is it true that qm never exhibits ssb some sources suggest otherwise but cant see way round the basic argument q2 in qft is it correct that conceptual difference with cm is that the system neednt be perturbed guess this is the case because we simply look at the expectation of the field langle phi rangle but how can convince someone that the field cannot just sit at the local maxima q3 find it strange that ssb disappears from qm to cm then reappears in qft are there other phenomena that have this feature is there nice way to understand this
69448 to measure the lifetime of specific particle one needs to look at very many such particles in order to calculate the average it cannot matter when the experimentalist actually starts his stopwatch to measure the time it takes for the particles to decay if he measures them now or in minutes makes no difference since he still needs to take an average if he measures later there will be particles out of the picture already those who have decayed in the last min which wont contribute and the ones his measuring now behave statistically the very same of course have just read the following in introduction to elementary particles by griffiths now elementary particles have no memories so the probability of given muon decaying in the next microsecond is independent of how long ago that muon was created its quite different in biological systems an year old man is much more likely to die in the next year than is year old and his body shows the signs of eight decades of wear and tear but all muons are identical regardless of when they were produced from an actuarial point of view they re all on an equal footing but this is not really the view had was imagining that particle that has existed for while is analogous to the year old man since it will probably die decay soon it just doesnt matter because we are looking at myriad of particles so statistically there will be about as many old ones as babies on the other hand it is true that cannot see if specific particle has already lived long or not they are all indistinguishable still am imagining particles as if they had an inner age but one just cant tell by their looks so is the view presented in griffiths truer than mine or are maybe both valid how can one argue why my view is wrong
69510 went to grocery store on hot day that was very well air conditioned and noticed as went through the open entrance that there seemed to be very powerful downward air current right at the doorway after crossing the invisible threshold the temperature immediately dropped good degrees or so how does this process work
69550 ive seen few references that say that in quantum mechanics of finite degrees of freedom there is always unique nondegenerate ground state or in other words that there is only one state up to phase of the hamiltonian with the minimum eigenvalue my questions is it true under what condition is it true can easily construct hermitian operator in finite dimensional space which has two lowest eigenvectors for example if left left right rangle left right rangle left right rangle right is an orthonormal basis of dimensional hilbert space define hamiltonian cdot left right rangle left langle right cdot left right rangle left langle right cdot left right rangle left langle right then left right rangle and left right rangle are two ground states if the answer to q1 was yes how is that consistent with this hamiltonian
69559 energy eigenstates provide convenient basis for solving quantum mechanics problems but they are by no means the only allowable states yet it seems to me that particles systems are assumed to be in energy eigenstates in nature some examples of what mean solving the schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom gives the standard nlm rangle basis of energy angular momentum eigenstates but we speak of filling up these orbitals with electrons or transitions between energy levels why should we expect to find the electrons only in such energy eigenstates as opposed to say some arbitrary superposition in quantum statistical mechanics we have bose einstein and fermi dirac distributions that give the number particles in state of energy epsilon but why must particle be found in state of definite energy to begin with
69667 in conventional conductors the rc time constant is the time required to charge or discharge capacitor through resistor by percent of the difference between the initial value and final value tau cdot however in superconductor the resistance is exactly zero tau cdot which would require infinite current because the capacitor is charged in time so the rc time constant equation above must not be valid for superconductors how should the rc time constant be defined in superconductor such that it does not require infinite current that is what is the expression for the time constant of charging superconducting capacitor by percent edit re framed the question because we were getting bogged down about signal propagation time now instead of using special relativity to point out the flaw in the equation note that it would require infinite current which would not be physically realizable
69828 as far as know the equivalence theorem states that the matrix is invariant under reparametrization of the field so to say if have an action phi the canonical change of variable phi to phi phi leaves the matrix invariant in itzyksons book there is now an exercise in which you have to show that the generating functional primej int mathcal phi exp is phi int 4x hspace 2cm jx phi phi gives the same matrix as the ordinary generating functional with only phi coupled to the current due to the vanishing contact terms he then writes that this proves the equivalence theorem which do not fully understand suppose take this canonical change of variable then get new action prime phi phi phi and generating functional zj int mathcal phi exp is phi phi int 4x hspace 2cm jx phi if now substitute phi phi chi get zj int mathcal chi det left frac partial phi partial chi right exp is chi int 4x hspace 2cm jx phi chi with phi chi chi chi the inverse of chi phi therefore comparing zj and primej get an extra jacobian determinant where is my fallacy or why should the determinant be thank you in advance
69936 abs from german antiblockiersystem is device put in almost every new automobile the web has lots of explanations about the system how it works but dont understand how it shortens the way of stopping the system wikipedia link is intended to prevent locking of wheels and thus allows keeping control of the car this understand when push brake pedal there are metal parts that touch wheel because of friction force between these metal parts and wheel the latter stops rotating and its kinetic energy is dispersed as thermal energy and both parts are hot it does not matter how strongly press the pedal if only it makes wheel stop rotating when it happens there is friction force between tyre and ground this force depends on among others cars mass the kinetic energy of moving car is please confirm dispersed as thermal energy sometimes stopping car leaves black trace on the ground if now abs starts to work it moves the metal parts away so the wheel can rotate again for some angle even if am still pushing the brake this is intended behavior and again the abs stops the wheel heard that such act can shorten the time to stop car but dont know why if the abs allows the wheel to rotate for some angle in this moment there is no friction between wheel and ground well actually there is because the wheel rotates but in this case it is useless friction so the way to stop the car should be longer again understand how the abs prevents wheels from blocking and allows maintaining control but dont how it shortens this distance the only thing can imagine is that this small angle of rotation prevents tyre from getting hot if it would be hot too much it becomes more liquid and the friction force is smaller this is why these tracks come from so the abs changes used part hot of tyre to fresh part cold this explanation is not confirmed by experiment which performed myself on ice with the speed ca km and it shortened the stopping distance but with this speed we should not think about thermal destruction of tyres
69949 why arent all spinning galaxies shaped as discs as my young mind would expect understand how the innermost parts of galaxy spin faster than the outer parts and that could explain why some galaxies are more spiraled than others based on age though this doesnt explain how the arms came into existence in the first place might it have something to do with an imperfect distribution of mass and therefore an imperfect distribution of gravity causing split in the disc from which point gravity centripetal force and inertia could take over or does something happen earlier in galaxys life
69997 this might be completely wrong question but this is bothering me since many days ago given the mass sun curves the space around it gravitation is the result of such curved space correct me if am wrong source documentary film given any point on circle with center same as center of the mass curvature in the space should be equal intuition planets rotate around the sun because of the curve in the space they should follow circular path and the distance between planet and sun should be at distance given the fact that earth has elliptical orbit around the sun and the distance between earth and sun varies according to position of the earth why do we have elliptical orbit not circular orbit
70035 want to delay visible light 450nm 600nm by 10ns one way would just be to have it travel about 10ft since the speed of light is about 1ft ns could reduce that length by sending it through some high index of refraction material dispersion is bit of concern in that case guess any recommendations for what that material should be
70047 the hubble constant which roughly gauges the extent to which space is being stretched can be determined from astronomical measurements of galactic velocities via redshifts and positions via standard candles relative to us recently value of km mpc was published on the scale of the value is small but not infinitesimal by any means did the calculation few months ago and think it came out to about meters year so can you conceive of measurement of the hubble constant that does not rely on any extra galactic observations ask because whatever the nature of the expansion described by the hubble constant it seems to be completely absent from sub galactic scales it is as though the energy of gravitational binding planets or for that matter electromagnetic binding atoms makes matter completely immune from the expansion of space the basis for this claim is that if space were also pulling atoms apart would naively assume we should be able to measure this effect through modern spectroscopy given that we are told the majority of the universe is dark energy responsible for accelerating the expansion wonder how does this expansion manifest itself locally any thoughts would be appreciated
70050 so think magnet is only attracted to magnet but magnet is not attracted to either magnet or only and can attract each other
70060 have hard time understand the statement that when you only look at the classical limit or classical physics string theory exactly agrees with general relativity because from what know string theory assumes fixed space time background ie all the strings and membranes interact in fix background and their interaction gives rise to fundamental particles that we observe but general relativity assumes that the space time background is influenced by what is in it and the interaction between them given that both have very different assumptions what do string theorists mean when they say string theory agrees with general relativity in classical limit or more specifically how does string theory fix spacetime background theory reconciles with the general relativity on dynamic spacetime background part can understand fix static spacetime in the context of changing dynamic spacetime background but cannot understand chanding dynamic spacetime in the context of fix static spacetime background
70318 need to explain the concept of light year to non technical audience actually presentation about planets and galaxies it is quite difficult for them to comprehend the speed of light itself leave alone the distance it travels in one year has anyone had to do this or can someone please give me few ideas of how we can describe this or is there another way to describe sizes of galaxies some galaxies are lightyears in diameter and the huge distances between them in some easy to understand way thanks kevin
70376 just as background should say am mathematics grad student who is trying to learn some physics ive been reading the theoretical minimum by susskind and hrabovsky and on page they introduce infinitesimal transformations heres the first example they use consider particle moving in the xy plane under the influence of potential which depends only on the radius with lagrangian frac dot dot vx this is clearly invariant under rotations rightarrow cos theta sin theta rightarrow sin theta cos theta all well and good now they say consider what happens when the angle theta is replaced by an infinitesimal angle delta already could say what the heck is delta really but im willing to play along with my intuition since delta is infinitesimal we work to first order and say cos delta and sin delta delta plugging this into our rotation formulas above we obtain rightarrow delta rightarrow delta by differentiating we see that dot rightarrow dot dot delta dot rightarrow dot dot delta plugging these into the lagrangian and ignoring terms higher than first order we see that the lagrangian is invariant under this transformation my main problem with all of this is that dont understand what the physical nature of an infinitesimal transformation actually is all got from the above was that if you do this formal calculation by following rules like only work to first order in delta then the lagrangian is invariant this is in contrast to the case where we have an actual transformation like rotation where there is no question about what is going on physically would also like to know how all of this relates to rigorous mathematics in mathematics cant recall ever using infinitesimals in an argument or calculation so it would be useful if there was some way of formulating the above in terms of limits derivatives differential forms for example sense connection to lie algebras as the infinitesimal version of the rotation is where is the identity matrix and is an element of the lie algebra of so2 here are some questions whose answers believe may be useful to me feel free to answer some or all what is an infinitesimal quantity like delta to the physicist why do physicists argue using infinitesimals rather than standard calculus what is the physical meaning of infinitesimal transformation how does it relate to lie algebras is there rigorous theoretical apparatus for justifying the computations shown above what is meant by the lagrangian being invariant under infinitesimal transformations if any of the questions seem too vague please say so thanks in advance for your insights
70452 couldnt picture the idea behind the zero magnetic flux outside the solenoid properly my teacher explained it as components of the magnetic field in other directions are cancelled by opposing fields from neighbouring coils outside the solenoid the field is also very weak due to this cancellation effect and for solenoid which is long in comparison to its diameter the field is very close to zero but didnt understand anything at all first he said about the components of magnetic field in other direction being cancelled by magnetic field but didnt further explain and said nothing to support his arguement if somebody has some simpleinituitive way of understanding this phenomenon then please explain it
70484 the question itself modern art sculptor anchors meter of cast iron pole in the ground and leaves meters of the pole sticking out of the ground at angle the owner of the metal shop told him that the pole is rated to withstand up to nm of torque before it bends if the sculptor decides instead to hang kg aluminum pheasant from the pole in the previous problem what is the net torque on the pole the correct answer since its all multiple choice and online is 0nm but for the life of me cant figure out why there isnt any net torque when the pole has something hanging on the end am missing something incredibly basic or was the wrong answer input as the correct one
70496 understand mathematically how one can obtain the conservation equations in both the conservative partial rho over partial nabla cdot rho textbf partial rho textbf over partial nabla cdot rho textbf textbf nabla partial over partial nabla cdot textbf and non conservative forms however am still confused why do we call them conservative and non conservative forms can any one explain from physical and mathematical point of view many off site threads deal with this question here and here but none of them provides good enough answer for me if any one can provide some hints will be very grateful
70541 the gps is very handy example in explaining to broad audience why it is useful for humanity to know the laws of general relativity it nicely bridges the abstract theory with daily life technologies id like to know an analogous example of technology which could not have been developed by engineers who didnt understand the rules of quantum mechanics guess that should say quantum mechanics because asking for particle physics application could be too early to bound the question no future applications teleportation no uncommon ones for who has quantum computer at home less frequently cited example than the laser please if possible for sake of simplicity well allow that the quantum theory appears in form of small correction to the classical one just like one doesnt need the full apparatus of general relativity to deduce the gravitational red shift
70562 having watched recent action movie with zombies in it wondered whether the suction from hole in the airplanes hull would really be able to rip out luggage persons and even seating benches to my understanding suction is nothing but the lack of pressure the suction in the airplanes cabin can only be proportional to the pressure in there bernoulli principle would quickly void the plane of breathable air justifying the oxygen masks that drop from the cealing in this short period things would get pushed towards the hole by the air leaving the cabin afterwards though once the pressure in the cabin has dropped significantly suction would cease as there is no more air that can exert force onto objects the question now is is the above correct description of the circumstances and if yes how large could the forces be would they be strong enough to rip people out of their seats or even the whole seat out of the airplane or is this another cinematic exaggeration
70601 am physicist who is not that well versed in mathematical rigour shame know but im working on it in walds book on qft in curved spacetimes found the following definitions of the direct sum of hilbert spaces he says next we define the direct sum of hilbert spaces let cal alpha be an arbitrary collection of hilbert spaces indexed by alpha we will be interested only with the case where there are at most countable number of hilbert spaces but no such restriction need be made for this construction the elements of the cartesian product times alpha cal alpha consist of the collection of vectors psi alpha for each psi alpha in cal alpha consider now the subset subset times alpha cal alpha composed of elements for which all but finitely many of the psi alpha vanish then has the natural structure of an inner product space we define the direct sum hilbert space bigoplus limits alpha cal alpha to be the hilbert space completion of it follows that in the case of countable infinite collection of hilbert spaces cal each psi in bigoplus limits cal consists of arbitrary sequences psi such that each psi in cal and sum limits left psi right infty here left right is the norm defined in cal also hilbert space completion of an inner product vector space is space cal such that subset cal and cal is complete in the associated norm it is constructed from by taking equivalence classes of cauchy sequences in now the questions why does have the structure of an inner product space how does he conclude that sum limits left psi right infty how does this definition of the direct sum match up with the usual things we see when looking at tensors in general relativity or in representations of lie algebras etc ps also have similar problem with walds definition of tensor product of hilbert spaces have decided to put that into separate question if you could answer this one please consider checking out that one too it can be found here thanks
70604 this question is regarding definition of tensor product of hilbert spaces that found in walds book on qft in curved space time lets first get some notation straight let denote set together with and being the addition and multiplication maps on that satisfy the vector space axioms we define the complex conjugate multiplication overline mathbb times to as overline psi overline psi forall psi in the vector space formed by overline is called the complex conjugate vector space and is denoted by overline given two hilbert spaces cal and cal and bounded linear map cal to cal we define the adjoint of this map dagger cal to cal as left psi psi right cal left dagger psi psi right cal where left right cal is the inner product as defined on cal similarly for cal and psi in cal psi in cal that such map always exists can be proved using the riesz lemma here the word bounded simply means that there exists some in mathbb such that left psi right cal leq left psi right cal for all psi in cal and where left right cal is the norm as defined on cal similarly for cal great now for the statement here it is the tensor product cal otimes cal of two hilbert spaces cal and cal may be defined as follows let denote the set of linear maps overline cal to cal which have finite rank such that the range of is finite dimensional subspace of cal the has natural vector space structure define the inner product on by left right text tr left dagger right the right side of the above equation is well defined since dagger overline cal to overline cal has finite rank we define cal otimes cal to be the hilbert space completion of it follows that cal otimes cal consists of all linear maps overline cal to cal that satisfy the hilbert schmidt condition text tr left dagger right infty my question is how does this definition of the tensor product of hilbert spaces match up with the one we are familiar with when dealing with tensors in general relativity ps also have similar problem with walds definition of direct sum of hilbert spaces have decided to put that into separate question if you could answer this one please consider checking out that one too it can be found here thanks
70651 always thought of current as the time derivative of charge frac dq dt however found out recently that it is the ampere that is the base unit and not the coulomb why is this it seems to me that charge can exist without current but current cannot exist without charge so the logical choice for base unit would be the coulomb right
70728 we make an important distinction between the topological insulators which are essentially uncorrelated band insulators with twist and topological order which covers variety of exotic properties in certain quantum many body ground states the topological insulators are clearly topological in the sense of the connectedness of the single particle hilbert space for one electron however they are not robust in the same way as topologically ordered matter my question is this topological order is certainly the more general and intriguing situation but the notion of topology seems actually less explicit than in the topological insulators is there an easy way to reconcile this perhaps starting point might be can we imagine topological insulator in fock space would such beast have long range entanglement and topological order edit while this has received very nice answers should maybe clarify what im looking for bit im aware of the standard definitions of symmetry protected topological insulators and topological order and why they are very different phenomena however if im talking to nonexperts can describe topological insulators as more or less berry phases can give rise to nontrivial band geometry and analogous to gauss bonnet there is nice quantity calculable from this that characterizes instead the band topology and this quantity is also physically measurable and they seem quite happy with this on the other hand while the connection to something like gauss bonnet might be clear for topological order in tqfts or in the ground state degeneracy these seem bit formal think my favorite answer is the adiabatic continuity or lack thereof that everett pointed out but now that im thinking about it perhaps what should have asked for is what are the geometric properties of states with topological order from which we could deduce the topological order with some kind of chern number but without starting from chern simons field theory and putting in the right one by hand is there anything like this
70751 flux as understand it is the amount of substance passing through particular surface over some time so from simple perspective considering photons that go through some virtual surface or doesnt matter they have fixed speed in vacuum text text to simplify even further theyre all hitting the surface head on so if we wanted to figure out how many photons go through the surface we conclude that at constant velocity they will only pass through the surface if they are in the volume bounded by sweeping the surface area along the velocity vector perpendicular to the surface the opposite of its normal distance in the alloted time vt so the flux volume is well defined as vt avt we could just look for period of unit time and drop the dependency on time but even then its useless if we cannot sample photon volume density rho to determine how many photons occupy unit volume in order to determine the actual flux that makes sense phi rho pvt and now comes along the electric flux and thwarts my understanding of the whole notion completely an electric field is generated when charge is dropped somewhere in space any other charge especially idealized point charges placed in its vicinity would experience force exerted on them by the source charge its magnitude modulated by the amount of charge so the electric field maps points in space with force vectors ie vector field whose direction and magnitude is parametrized by the interaction between the source charge and the point charge and this electric flux is defined as phi cdot ill use phi cdot and just cannot interpret the semantics of this dot product the products dimensionality is not what ive come to expect from the notion of flux text vm or any other how does this in any way show how much electric field flow goes through surface furthermore what is this vague thing called electric field flow it seems like it is completely disconnected ive tried expressing it in different ways from the derivation of the expression of an electric field which makes sense non vector form dropped unit vector frac pi varepsilon frac ive intentionally separated the inverse square of the distance and the pi which is presume part of the normalization factor steradians of sphere but noticed that together they forge the area of sphere pi this way could see the expression as the uniform charge density distribution on the surface of sphere scaled by the vacuum permittivity frac varepsilon and then due to presumed uniformity by multiplying by an arbitrary area could get the flux the amount of charge flowing through particular surface in unit time phi cdot frac varepsilon could see that as flux but im really not sure can really reinterpret parts of the normalization factor and the inverse square of the distance into the area of sphere from the perspective of voltage over distance it makes absolutely no sense to me any help would be appreciated
70823 ive seen the phrase trace anomaly refer to two seemingly different concepts though assume they must be related in some way im not seeing the first way ive seen it used is in the manner for example that is relevant for the theorem and theorem that is given cft on curved background the trace of the energy momentum tensor is non zero due to trace anomalies which relate mu mu to different curvatures that is in 4d mu mu sim square ae cw where is the euler density and is the square of the weyl tensor the second manner in which ive seen it used is in the context of relating mu mu to beta functions as the presence of non zero beta function indicates scale dependence and hence breaks conformal invariance for example yang mills is classically conformally invariant but it is quoted as having trace anomaly which seems to be of different character than that of the previous paragraph as in the peskin and schroeder chapter on scale anomalies its quoted that since the gauge coupling depends on scale due to rg the theory is not quantum mechanically scale invariant or more generally guess weyl invariant and hence mu mu is non zero slightly more precisely given the ym lagrangian mathcal sim frac rm tr one finds mu mu sim betag rm tr or something to that effect its my understanding that this second kind of trace anomaly is important for explaining the mass of nuclei as most of their mass comes from gluonic energy that might be wrong though and its not so relevant anyway whats the relation between these two types of anomalies are they the same thing in disguise
70855 just recently watched video where they were explaining the double slit experiment understand that the interference pattern would be observed if you send photons or electrons one after the other the conclusion that the author seems to make is that it is as though the particle packet of energy travels through both the slits after somehow splitting into two has anyone done an experiment where they send just one particle and end the experiment do you observe two points on the screen in that case or just one
70882 many if not all of the materials ive read claim ward identity is consequence of gauge invariance of the theory while actually their derivations only make use of current conservation partial mu mu which is only equivalent to global phase symmetry im aware of the fact that gauge field has to be coupled to conserved current to keep gauge invariance but non gauge field can also bethough not must be coupled to conserved current and in that case ward identity should still hold so do you think it is at least misleading if not wrong to claim ward identity is consequence of gauge invariance
70887 as above surely it must go somewhere my child asked me this question and it was difficult one to answer
70897 have some confusion over vectors its components and dimensions does the number of vector components mean that vector is in that many dimensions for vector with components has dimensions also how can vector have fourth dimension how can we graphically represent vectors with more than dimensions its hard for me to visualize such vector can anyone point me to some resource where they explain this graphically and in detail
70919 due to one can convert mass to energy classic example would be matter anti matter annihilation to produce energy photons etc can one do the reverse so could one do something to photons to create mass
70921 how is graphene 2d substance it has length width and some thickness to it else it would be invisible why is it considered 2d substance
70979 dont know how to say it but in the tv dominatrices and the popular science books we see the string theory as the best theory to explain everything and as the only game in town etc and yet in cern the largest physics laboratory they are just using the standard model sm as the only way to find the theory of everything toe and sometime they call it theory of almost everything also they didnt even mention anything about string theory as if it doesnt exist so my question is why isnt it easier for them to take the string theory as theory of everything also the standard model is not able to explain the gravitational force from the sm equation so the sm is essentially incomplete why do they keep working on the sm am missing something here im an engineer not physicist so dont know much about the details
70993 we know through general relativity gr that matter curves spacetime st like ball curves trampoline but then how energy curves spacetime is it just like matter curvature of st
71017 my physics text has problem in which it is said that person moves block of wood in such way so that the block moves at constant velocity the block therefore is in dynamic equilibrium and the vector sum of the forces acting on it is equal to zero sum ma times this is where get confused if the person is moving the block in such way so that the sum of the forces acting on it is equal to zero how can he be moving it at all realize that even if there is no force acting on an object it can still have velocity newtons first law force causes acceleration change in velocity not velocity itself but for some reason dont understand how it is possible for the object to move with constant acceleration velocity do have all the pieces really feel like am missing something edit the block was at rest to begin with and the person is moving the block through the air edit the actual problem for the sake of clearing up ambiguity here is the actual problem thought it was wooden blocks at first sorry two workers must pick up bricks that like on the ground and place them on worktable they each pick up the same number of bricks and put them on the same height worktable they lift the bricks so that the bricks travel upward at constant velocity the first gets the job done in one half the time that the second takes did one of the workers do more work than the other if so which one did one of the workers exert more power than the other if so which one basically the intent of this question is to ask if the above problem is entirely hypothetical my text does not indicate that it is which is what find confusing
71069 air is times denser than aerographite but looking at pictures or videos presenting the material see it resting on tables rather than raising to the ceiling also since the material is made of carbon nanotubes assume there are empty spaces between those tubes why are those spaces not occupied by air
71119 in the small amount of physics that have learned thus far there seems to be possibly superficial pattern that have been wondering about the formula for the kinetic energy of moving particle is frac mv the formula for kinetic rotational energy is frac omega the formula for energy stored in capacitor is frac delta the formula for energy delivered to an inductor is frac li finally everyone is aware of einsteins famous formula mc realize there are other energy formulas gravitational potential energy for example that do not take this form but is there some underlying reason why the formulas above take similar form is it coincidence or is there motivation for physicists and textbook authors to present these formulas the way they do
71120 according to my physics book if an electron were accelerated with mev of kinetic energy and collided into 100g thermally insulated copper block not sure if the fact it is thermally insulated is relevant the energy would transfer into thermal energy on the copper block and the copper block would heat up by few degrees however if were to collide into that same copper block with bowling ball travelling with mev of kinetic energy then that energy would be transferred into kinetic energy on the copper block and the copper block would move it seems to me that in both cases there is thing smashing into another thing with mev of energy when the first thing is small electron the energy is transferred into thermal energy when the first thing is large the energy is transferred into kinetic energy why doesnt the electrons energy get transferred into kinetic energy as well
71184 over on photography question was asked as to why camera lenses are always cylindrical paraphrasing slightly one of the answers and follow up comments asserted that quantum effects are significant and that you need to understand qed in order to understand lens design my intuition tells me that this probably isnt the case and that modern lens design can be handled via classical optical theory is my intuition correct or are quantum effects really significant in modern lenses
71263 there is popular belief that wet skin burns or tans faster however ive never heard believable explanation of why this happens the best explanation ive heard is that the water droplets on the skin act as lens focusing the sunlight onto your skin dont see how this would affect an overall burn because the amount of sunlight reaching the skin is the same ignoring reflection is this fact true and if so what causes it

71455 am in the middle of discussion with friend about the meaning of the term clockwise wikipedia indicates that clockwise rotation goes as top right down left however my friend argues that the clock is facing opposite to you so if you rotate top right down left facing the side the clock is facing then it is anti clockwise our question therefore is does clockwise mean top right down left or left down right top
71503 the ideal black body radiation curve unlike the quantized emission seen from atomic spectra is continuous over all frequencies many objects approximate ideal blackbodies and have radiation curves very similar in shape and continuity to that of an ideal black body often minus some emission and absorption lines from the atoms in an object such as radiation curves seen from stars am wondering what exactly gives rise to basically continuous black body radiation curve in real objects since atomic energy states are quantized it seems real life black body curves would have some degree of measurable quantization to them or perhaps the degree of quantization is so small the radiation curves look continuous
71509 the classic example of an indeterministic system is radioactive isotope the one that kills schr dingers cat get there are arguments against hidden variables in quantum mechanics but how could they be so sure back in the twenties that the strong nuclear forces involved in radioactivity were not governed by hidden variables rather than true randomness einstein was very unhappy about the indeterminism of quantum mechanics regarding even well understood effects like youngs slit experiments but it seems kind of ideological and brash on behalf of heisenberg co to extend the indeterminism over to phenomena they hadnt even begun to understand like alpha decay is there reason for this early self assuredness in postulating indeterminsm
71582 my understanding of orbital mechanics is very limited but as understand geostationary satellite they stay in place by having an orbital speed corresponding to the spot theyre orbiting over so my basic intuition tells me that its not possible to have geostationary satellite over the poles since theyre effectively standing still and to my knowledge satellite must keep certain velocity to keep from getting pulled down by gravity am missing something

71620 if its really hot inside but cooler outside what is the best way to place single fan to try and cool room down always assumed it would be better pointing inwards and this thread suggests the same however today had thought if the room had bad smell in it we would probably expect fan blowing air out would remove the smell faster than fan blowing inwards is smell really any different to heat would it be more efficient to remove heat by blowing the fan different way to smell
71661 you can try it with your own uncooked spaghetti if you want it almost always breaks into three when you snap it am asking for good physical theory on why this is along with evidence to back it up or reference to good study previously done on this would also be satisfactory the math behind everything would be great bonus if it exists my hypothesis is that strand of dry spaghetti has two main pressure areas being put on it due to how brittle and how high the length to thickness ratio is and that they snap at almost the same time due to the manufacturing process of the strand causing it to have very consistent breaking point also that vibrations from first break could influence the causing of another im not sure how this could be tested though
71706 this may sound like dumb question but googling didnt seem to help mostly because im having hard time formulating the question and anything with mass seems to direct me to mass effect am trying to find out if we know who philosopher scientists or just civilization formulated the idea that objects which are larger or heavier than others have more stuff in them which makes them heavier realize that cavemen would have known this since rock is harder to move then rock but want to know who is credited with actually formulating theory of mass
71763 the gravitation formula says frac so if the mass of bob increases then the torque on it should also increase because the force increased so it should go faster and thus the oscillation period should be decrease my physics book says that period is only affected by effective length and why doesnt mass of bob affect the period

71949 consider the classical xor gate given bit system xorg mod is the following good generalizaiton of quantum xor gate given qubit system we now write xorq notice that if we set and the rest to that the quantum xor behaves exactly like classical xor but it also has the ability to generalize to fractional and complex
71987 in operator formalism for example point time ordered greens function is defined as langle mathcal phix phix rangle op thetax phix phix thetax phix phix where the subscript op refers to operator formalism now if one is to take time derivative of it the result will be frac partial partial langle mathcal phix phix rangle op langle mathcal frac partial phix partial phix rangle op deltax phix phix the delta function comes from differentiating the theta functions this means time derivative does not commute with time ordering if we consider path integral formalism the time ordered greens function is defined as langle mathcal phix phix rangle pi int mathcal phi phix phix 2e is phi of course langle mathcal phix phix rangle op langle mathcal phix phix rangle pi as is proved in any qft textbook however in path integral case time derivative commutes with time ordering because we dont have anything like theta function thus frac partial partial int mathcal phi phix phix 2e is phi int mathcal phi frac partial partial phix phix 2e is phi did bit googling and found out that for the path integral case the time ordered product is called mathcal product and operator case just mathcal product am not that interested in what is causing the differencestill explanations on this are welcomed because can already vaguely see its due to some sort of ambiguity in defining the product of fields at equal time the question that interests me is which is the right one to use when calculating feynman diagrams did find case where both give the same result scalar qedc itzykson zuber section but is it always the case if these two formulations are not effectively equivalent then it seems every time we write down something like langle partial phi cdots rangle we have to specify whether its in the sense of the path integral definition or operator definition edit as much as enjoy user1504s answer after thinking and reading bit more dont think analytic continuation is all the mystery in peskin schroeder chap they manage to use path integral to get result equivalent to operator approach without any reference to analytic continuation it goes like this consider product for free kg field langle phix phix rangle int mathcal phi phix phix 1e is phi apply dyson schwinger equation we get int mathcal phi partial phix phix 1e is delta 4x then they just assume the partial commute with path integrationwhich is already weird according to our discussion and they conclude partial int mathcal phi phix phix 1e is partial langle phix phix rangle delta 4x this is just the right result given by operator approach in which deltax comes from theta function given my limited knowledge on the issue this consistency looks almost miracle to me what is so wicked behind these maths response to drake if is positive infinitesimal then int dot at bt is equiv int phi at at over bt is frac langle at abt rangle frac langle atbt rangle notice the second term has an ordering ambiguity from path integralsay dot phi phi and we can make it in any order we want by choosing an appropriate time discretization ron maimons post cited by drake keeping this in mind we proceed frac langle at abt rangle frac langle atbt rangle frac thetaa langle at abt rangle frac theta langle btat rangle frac langle atbt rangle frac thetaa langle at abt rangle frac thetaa langle btat rangle frac langle atbt rangle frac thetaa langle at abt rangle frac langle btat rangle langle atbt rangle now taking advantage of ordering ambiguity of the last term to make it langle btat rangle this amounts to defining using backward discretization say dot phi frac phit epsilon phit epsilon then the finally frac thetaa langle at abt rangle frac langle bt at at rangle to frac 2a langle atbt rangle langle bt dot rangle here again very dubious step to get frac 2a we need to assume thetaa to theta0 frac but this is really not true because theta is discontinuous however on the other hand since was defined to be postive infinitesimal at the very beginning we couldve written frac langle at abt rangle frac langle atbt rangle frac langle at abt rangle frac langle atbt rangle then all the above derivation doesnt work im sure there are more paradoxes if we keep doing these manipulations
71994 given points that are connected with each other with resistor of resistance find the resistance between any two points answer all the conducting wires have the same resistance know that such wording immediately implies that these points are absolutely identical which makes it possible to apply symmetry arguments that will help in reducing the network to simpler one that is after choosing any two points in the network the remaining four points will still be identical so we can swap any of them and the network will remain the same thus we can remove the resistors which are connected between these other four points since the points are identical however we can also swap the two chosen points and the system will still remain the same so why cant we also remove the resistor between the two chosen points im told of the following analogy the system of these points is like system of absolutely similar balls painted say in white by choosing two points we paint them in black thus the system loses some symmetry level but its certain elements are still symmetrical under certain rearrangements specifically any two of the white balls can be swapped without changing the system in any way so all the white balls are identical and we can ignore any resistors between them but swapping the two black balls still wont change the system so why cant we follow the same logic and ignore the resistor between them as well ill generalize the question little bit why dont we care about other symmetries in the system im looking forward simple explanation without involving advanced math as im just self taught beginner and im only familiar with calculus so try to avoid matrices and anything advanced which students learn in advanced courses of electronics just want to get the idea and the concept itself

72174 while answering another question about heat in an atom the discussion in the comments led to the question of how heat is related to thermal radiation picked up by infrared cameras the answer is that molecules undergoing translational motion which therefore have temperature emit energy in the ir range and the intensity of the radiation in that range is related to the temperature what is the actual mechanism for the emission of this energy what is it about translation that causes the emission does it require collisions with other atoms molecules to cause change in momentum and the emission of thermal energy thereby slowing down cooling the bodies involved in the collision does that mean in rarefied conditions where the mean free path is relatively large the rate of ir emissions decreases while the intensity is still only dependent on the temperature
72315 was told that in physics and in chemistry as well there are processes that may be described by differential equation of the form ky that is the variation of variable depends from the number of pairs of the elements understand the mathematical meaning of that equation but cannot conceive of any physical process which leads to this maybe some nuclear reaction could but am at loss any hints

72686 according to my understanding at the smallest level sound is just collection of particles colliding on wave so assuming we can arbitrarily reduce the size of any human being how small can we reduce someone while this someone can still hear normal size human beings talk coherently edit in other words how small do we have to be in order for it to become impossible to differentiate random collisions with other particles from collisions that result from the wave edit2 to avoid the shrinking human problem how about thinking about small recorder how small can the recorder be in order to record and play back frequencies heard by the human ear and for it to not play random noise generated by random collisions

72824 was thinking what shape does black hole have by shape mean its form circle cylinder sphere torus etc we usually think of black holes as if theyre plugholes flat circular object but what if theyre spherical spherical black hole would make much more sense would imagine than black hole shaped like basketball would be capable of pulling more mass towards it than flat one as it has higher surface to volume ratio to do so edit know that its probably sphere but when you think about it cylinder could also be potential shape
72874 understand the lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics to degree can derive the euler lagrange equations from the least action principle and equivalently can determine the equations of motion from given lagrangian can handle lagrangian exercises in textbooks with ease dont quite grok it though if you erased it from my mind wouldnt be able to re invent it so im going back through it the way understand the euler lagrange equation is thus in classical physics by observation there is stationary quantity this stationary quantity is called the action and it is the sum of energies over time alternatively product of energy and time again by observation energies can be calculated given the positions and velocities of all elements of the system call such function mathcal dot treat it as black box then we have action int dt mathcal dot making this stationary we derive frac partial mathcal partial frac dt frac partial mathcal partial dot informally this says to me that the paths taken in actual physics are ones where small perturbations in particles position are canceled out precisely by the changes in velocity before and after that position where the velocity changes are caused by the position perturbation this has an almost economic elegance to it but it still doesnt completely make sense to me what lagrangian is its unit is energy sure but also dont quite grok energy beyond the abstract so figured id play with few simple lagrangians hoping to break the formulation and learn something from how the pieces fell take for example this trivial function mathcal it describes an unphysical world surely energy is far from conserved but figured constructing weird but simple lagrangian would give me insight as to the nature of the formulation lets derive the equations of motion frac partial mathcal partial frac partial mathcal partial frac dt frac partial mathcal partial so the path taken is the path satisfying huh the laws of motion are unsatisfiable im not sure how to take that what precisely went wrong here im looking for geometric or intuitive explanation the algebraic troubles understand what sort of world was trying to construct whence the contradiction more generally when you are handed lagrangian what does it really signify can integrate it to get the action an abstract number assigned to path or can plug it into the euler lagrange equations to figure out motion but what does it mean in its native form how do read lagrangian without twisting its arm

73225 photons have no mass yet they interact gravitationally as all energy does with other energetic and massive particles this means that if you put multiple photons in system you get something that appears to have mass even though none of the constituent particles do have mass that makes me wonder is mass really fundamental part of reality couldnt it be that massive particles protons neutrons electrons are just composed of massless particles like photons knotted up confined to small area and whizzing around in very tight orbits so everything is in sense massless the search for and discovery of the higgs boson suggests to me in my limited understanding that scientists believe mass is fundamental property that some particles have and also that mass is fundamentally different than other types of energy though conversion is possible does all of this preclude system like describe
73262 say for sake of argument someone was randomly transported in time and space would it be possible for them to determine their location on earth and the current time using just observations of the stars they have no charts or equipment not even anything to write with so all calculations must be done in their head but have working knowledge of constellations and the location of other celestial bodies their tolerance for accuracy is pretty wide the location can be as vague as the north west of the north american coast central australia etc other things such as geographical landmarks and seasonal conditions can refine this but were not interested in that the time can be years if its possible to do better with mental calculations then all well and good if this is possible could you outline the procedure for doing so
73279 wikipedia has this page on gravity assists using planets in some cases this effect was used to accelerate the spacecraft to higher velocity this diagram shows this in very oversimplified manner that got me thinking that if light is affected by gravity and if it slingshots around the black hole massive object cant it gain higher speed than what limitations are stopping it from doing this forgive me if the answer to this question is pretty straight forward or staring you in the face kind havent fully understood the mechanics of the gravitational slingshot fully yet but couldnt wait to ask this note if it is possible highly doubt that could you provide an explanation using newtonian mechanics im not very familiar with general relativity because im in high school
73373 in analogy to piezoelectric materials where the application of an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the material have the following question are there solid materials whose porosity can be altered or controlled of course have googled this this lead me to lot of websites where controllable porosity means that the porosity of material is very well defined when it is produced this is not what am looking for am looking for material that can alter its porosity according to an external control quantity such as electric voltage
73403 final edit think pretty much understand now touch wood but theres one thing dont get whats the physical reason for expecting the correlation functions to be independent of the cutoff why couldnt we just plump for one master lagrangian at the planck scale and only do our integration up to that point perhaps it has something to do with low energy experiments not being influenced by planck scale physics maybe its because there isnt any fundamental scale that lambda must be arbitrary in qft approximation for some reason ill award the bounty to anyone who can explain this final conundrum cheers apologies if this question is too philosophical and vague ive been thinking about qfts and continuum mechanics and reading about their interpretation as effective theories in these theories we have natural cutoffs at high momentum small scales we make the assumption star that the large scale physics is decoupled from the small scale therefore we hope that our predictions are independent of the cutoff after some renormalization if necessary why is the assumption star so reasonable guess it seems observationally correct which is powerful empirical evidence but could it not be the case that the small scale physics had ramifications for larger scale observations in other words would it be reasonable to expect that the predictions of toe might depend on some planck scale cutoff this question may be completely trivial or simply ridiculous sorry if so im just trying to get real feel for the landscape edit id like to understand this physically from the purely qft perspective without resorting to analogy with statistical physics it might help if rephrase my question as follows in the wilsonian treatment of renormalization we get flow of lagrangians as the energy scale lambda changes for renormalizable theory we assume that theres bare lagrangian independent of lambda in the limit lambda to infty we calculate with this quantity by splitting it into physical terms and counterterms think these counterterms come from moving down the group flow but im not quite sure but why do we care about and calculate with the bare lagrangian rather than one at some prescribed high energy scale say the planck scale dont really understand the point of there existing lambda to infty limit
73422 wavefunction is inherently multi particle function if you have container that is perfectly isolated from the external universe not possible but just imagine it and filled with particles then the information necessary to perfectly describe everything there is to know about that system would be contained in psi vec vec vec the probabilities of all obtainable measurements could be derived from that function however frequently read about wavefunctions of individual particles within system such that the assumption psi vec vec vec psi vec psi vec psi vec is made one of my professors has said that individual particle wavefunctions are more fundamental description of reality however did not think this was correct because it would completely exclude the effects of quantum entanglement then again this was graduate chemical engineering course where im going with this is in what situations is it okay to separate the complete wavefunction like that how do you know that an isolated electron in an experiment isnt influenced by the rest of the particles in the universe its frequently said that when measurement of system is made the wavefunction collapses into one of its eigenstates but how is this possible if there is no such thing as single particle or few particle wavefunction wouldnt it instead be the case that the overall psi left text particle in experiment text measurement apparatus text all other particles right has evolved in time realize my question is somewhat vague but any kind of clarification on this issue would be appreciated

73515 consider cement block of the same density as sea water resting on the perfectly polished seafloor also assume the side faces of the cement block are highly polished so that no vertical hydrostatic forces can attack on them cable is attached to the top of the block my question ist how much force must one apply to the cable before the cement block begins to lift off the seafloor the normal response would be to say that only negligible force is needed as the block is practically suspended in the water however as the bottom surface of the cement block is not in contact with the water it is not experiencing the hydrostatic pressure from below only from above before the crane starts lifting the zero sum forces on the cement block are seawater pressure gravity on cement block seafloor resistance as the crane starts applying force the seafloor will reduce its resistance in the same measure leaving the forces on the cement block zero seawater pressure gravity on cement block seafloor resistance crane just before the cement block lifts the seafloor will stop applying force and the crane will be applying the only upward force crane seawater pressure gravity on cement block once the cement block lifts off the sea floor hydrostatic pressure kicks in on the lower cement surface suspending the block but before that boy does it take lot of force to lift it what is wrong with this reasoning
73532 motivation was recently reviewing the section in sakurais quantum mechanics in which he discusses tensor operators and was left desiring more mathematically general precise discussion then skimmed the wikipedia page on tensor operators and felt similarly dissatisfied heres why in these discussions one essentially defines an indexed set of operators cdots to be cartesian tensor operator of rank provided ur cdots daggerr phantom cdots phantom cdots for each rotation in mathrm so where is some unitary representation of mathrm so acting on hilbert space usually that of some physical system whose behavior under rotations we with to study similarly one defines spherical tensor operator of rank as an indexed set of operators with qq for which ur daggerr sum qq rt where is the irreducible representation of mathrm so of dimension based on these standard definitions would think that one could define something less coordinate dependent and extended to representations of any group not just mathrm so as follows candidate definition let group be given let be unitary representation of on hilbert space mathcal and let rho be representation of on finite dimensional real or complex vector space multilinear linear operator valued function to mathrm lin mathcal is called tensor operator relative to the pair of representations and rho provided begin align ug tv dots ug dagger rhogv dots rhogv end align for all in and for all dots in notice that if basis dots for is given and if we define the components dots of in this basis by begin align dots tu dots end align and if rhog phantom ij denotes the matrix representation of rhog in this basis then by using multilinearity the defining property of tensor operator can be written as follows begin align ug cdots daggerg rhog phantom cdots rhog phantom cdots end align so this definition immediately reproduces the cartesian tensor definition above if we take mathbb mathrm so and rhor and similarly for the spherical tensor definition if we take mathbb 2n mathrm so rho and question is the sort of object just defined the proper formalization generalization of the notion of tensor operators used in physics it seems to contain the notion of tensor operator used in the physics literature is there any literature on the sort of object define here would think that the answer would be yes since this sort of thing seems to me like natural generalization mathematically minded physicist might like to study
73564 my five year old daughter was asking about astronauts the other day and why they float in space after me showing her few bits on the kids section on the nasa web site started explaining about the planets and how the sun was ball of gas and you couldnt stand on it then had to explain to her what gas was using ice water and steam as examples for the three main states few hours later she asked me if the bubbles from the bubble bath in the bath water were liquid and if they were why didnt the gravity make them run off her hands like water that had me stumped im not scientist but ive been doing my best to try and figure this out and explain it to her but im not fully sure either firstly are bubbles from bubble bath liquid or have made bad assumption thought it might be down to friction but assume bubble bath is detergent and shouldnt encounter much friction then thought it might be because the bubbles had large surface area relative to their weight and would suffer wind resistance as result my best guess now is that its because the bubbles were more viscous than the water are any of these right if not can someone explain it to me in simple terms so can tell her please update wow thanks for all the responses im usually on stackoverflow and dont think that in two and half years on there ive asked anything thats generated this level of response thank you to everyone who took the time to answer or comment ive read all thats been written here explained this to my daughter last night saying that the bubble bath liquid was sticky and as result would stick to things and slow down gravitys pull drew bubble and explained about the liquid stopping the air in the middle getting out and by standing opposite and holding hands both explained how we were like the liquid of the bubble squeezing the air in the middle which she understood expect that if shes asking questions like this now ill be on here again soon asking something else ive certainly learnt lot thanks again
73626 few sequential questions is it possible for nuclear explosion to be small enough to produce ml one cup mushroom cloud if so how much uranium would that take how close to the explosion could one be in normal clothing not to suffer from burns or excessive radiation exposure
73654 cosmic rays can have energies going into the ev domain asteroids and meteoroids originating in the solar system are probably limited in their speed because they all started out from the same lump of matter having more or less the same speed but what about rocks from other galaxies could they reach relativistic speeds in relation to the solar system are there astronomical events that could be interpreted as collision between such an asteroid and planet or star just mole of hydrogen atoms with that kind of energy would have three times the energy of the chicxulub impact event so hope theres reason for them not existing
73692 so there was resting me eyes thinking about rocket drives and what not the thought struck me that perhaps even before mr einstein interferes with the increasing velocity of the spacecraft mr newton may have something to say please poke me in the rib if my comprehension is wrong rocket basically reaction mechanism must push gases out of its exhaust to impart velocity to the spacecraft assuming adequate fuel is available what happens when the spacecraft velocity is equal to velocity at the exhaust at this stage does the rocket still accelerate the craft
73713 have stumbled upon given question really have hard time to solve basically need to find an equivalent resistance in some form of ladder configuration where the chain is an infinite sequence of resistors have really no good idea how to find this equivalent resistance trying the old fashioned rule of parallel and resistors in series came to very messy formula frac frac frac frac frac know however that the solution should be much more simple now tried using kirchhoffs loop rule which states that the power difference in closed loop must be naming the potential currents between ab between bc through the single resistance and the current from to the right considering the loop containing bc the rest of the structure this rewrites to cdot cdot eq the problem is variables functions doesnt really bring me closer to an answer what am missing
73745 it is known that matter and antimatter annihilate each other when they touch each other and as far as know the concept of touching as our brain gets it is not true on the atomic level since atoms never really touch each other but only get affected by different forces if this is true then when does the annihilation really happen does it happen when two atoms are affected by each others repulsion force for example
73766 the earths rotation around the sun isnt exactly hours it off by some seconds which becomes somewhere around hours per year and day in yearsleap year which brings the question why didnt we modify the measurement of second ever so slightly so as to avoid leap years altogether well how is second measured exactly wikipedia says the duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium atom well why is it measured that way is there any technical reason like it is easy to measure and can be standardized easily or is it really possible to modify the measurement of time

73803 need to do some work with liquid nitrogen at home the main question is how to store it without buying huge vacuum flask specifically for liquid nitrogen ive tried to use usual steel household vacuum bottles added cm of extra insulation some foamy material multiple layers wrapped in plastic to protect from condensation cap is also made from this foamy material remember that should not seal the flask the problem is that liquid nitrogen evaporates in hours suppose the main issue is cap construction sides of the flasks are warm while cap is cold also it seems heat loses are maximum near cap because hot and cold steel sides are touching there any known tricks on how to improve heat insulation and prolong lifetime of liquid nitrogen is that correct that should be wrapping it all in aluminum foil on the hot side of insulation my goal is days evaporation is just perfect
73867 ive been studying quantum mechanics and quantum field theory for few years now and one question continues to bother me the schr dinger picture allows for an evolving state which evolves through unitary reversible evolution schr dinger equation represented by the hamiltonian operator and an irreversible evolution wave function collapse represented by projection operator the heisenberg picture holds the states constant and evolves the operators instead it provides an equivalent representation of the unitary evolution on operators but havent yet seen an equivalent heisenberg representation of wave function collapse is there any accepted explanation for how to represent state collapse in the heisenberg picture thanks
73942 electrons have spin and as they are charged they also have an associated magnetic moment which can be measured by an electron beam splitting up in an inhomogeneous magnetic field or through the interaction of the electronss magnetic moment with an external magnetic field in spectroscopic measurements on the other hand photon is neutral how can one measure its spin if theres no magnetic moment how do we know it has spin
73959 im just starting to learn physics and have question that is probably stupid learned that energy levels that the bound electron can have are discrete also learned that when an electron transitions from one level to another photon with specific wavelength energy is created and released into the wild my question is this are there holes in the electromagnetic spectrum values of frequency that the created photon cant possibly have

73962 well do not believe that earth is flat but met some conspirationistas believing that all physics we learn in school is twisted all the earths pictures from space are photoshopped by nasa etc etc so those guys wanted to put satellite into orbit take some pics and see for themselves of course satellite wont stay above flat earth but what other very simple means to prove check that earth is round well geoid do we have am looking for simple means available to anyone that do not need any external tool or knowledge that naysayer would reject some things ive considered meteorological balloon with camera and phone with gps with parachute to recover it it has been done by amateurs and in good conditions you can see the earths curvature measure the suns height above horizon at noon at two different latitudes the difference along with some simple geometry would give you earths diameter
74051 we can see diffraction of light if we allow light to pass through slit but why doesnt diffraction occur if we obstruct light using some other object say block why are shadows formed why doesnt light diffract around the obstruction as it does around the slit
74185 spin silver atoms have definite spin axis up or down along an axis labeled this in turn means that they carry angular momentum in an overt visible fashion however spin photons do not seem to display an experimentally meaningful version of spin axis unless im completely missing something very possible instead photons in the form of light display an effect we call polarization by which we mean the light has definite vibrational orientation in space this effect follows the same circ rules as the basis states for massive spin particles but lacks the directionality of those states so for example if is horizontal and is vertical vertically polarized light could be interpreted as exhibiting rotation in yz plane which is the same plane of rotation that gives rise to and spins for particles with mass but since photons have no mass and travel at there is no way to assign pm to this nominal rotation instead the light appears to be composed of particles with no visible spin or perhaps alternatively as superpositions of equal and cancelling quantities of and spin circular polarization seems at first glance to provide solution by providing distinct clockwise and counterclockwise directions ive gone that route myself but the more look at it the more sure am that its bogus assignment if nothing else circular polarization can always be decomposed into two planar polarization that have relative phase shift furthermore the idea of spin axis pointing along the infinitely compressed direction of propagation of massless particle is problematic at very best circular polarization still seems to me the most promising path for finding real angular momentum in photons but if it is the solution must admit that the more look at it the less see how so at last my question if there is no way to demonstrate experimentally that an arbitrarily small unit of light carries explicit non zero angular momentum how then does photon manage to convey the unit of spin required needed for it to balance angular momentum in particle interactions
74324 recently read an article in the ny times called black hole mystery wrapped in firewall paradox really liked the article but reading one quote immediately made me think of asking physics se question from the material in the smoke and flames of burning book for example one could figure out whether it was the bible or the kama sutra the same should be true of the fizz and pop of black holes these physicists argued so physics se theoretically how would you figure out what book was burned from the smoke and flames do not intend for this to be silly question if the idea of information loss inside of black hole is so difficult for some physicists to come to terms with figure those same physicists should have perfectly good answer to my question
74456 am reading berkeley physics course volume electricity and magnetism by edward purcell am in chapter page and the book discusses conductors the following is from the book because the surface of conductor in fig is necessarily surface of constant potential the electric field which is nabla varphi must be perpendicular to the surface at every point on the surface have omitted the picture because it is not relevant what is the reasoning understand that the potential varphi is continuous function and since inside the conductor and since nabla varphi get that varphi inside and on the surface from continuity of the conductor however dont understand the reason the book gives for explaining why the field is perpendicular to every point on the surface
74569 as planet moves through the solar system bow shock is formed as the solar wind is decelerated by the magnetic field of the planet presumably the creation of this shock wave would cause drag on the planet certainly in the direction of orbit but possibly rotation as well is there an estimate for the amount of drag on the earth as it orbits the sun based on the drag how long would it take before the orbital velocity slows to the point that we spiral slowly into the sun would any planets fall into the sun prior to the sun expanding into red giant gobbling them up
74625 this popular question about whether an ac circuit with one end grounded to earth and the other end grounded to mars would work ignoring resistance inductance of the wire was recently asked on the electronics se picture edited from the one in the above link though respect the ac dc experts there think with the exception of the top answer they are all wrong my issue is that they all assume that ac requires complete circuit in order to function however my understanding is that complete circuit is necessary for dc but not ac my intuitive understanding is that ac is similar to two gas filled rooms with pump between them the pump couldnt indefinitely pump gas from one room to another without complete circuit dc but it could pump the gas back and forth indefinitely ac in the latter case not having complete circuit just offers more resistance to the pump with smaller rooms causing larger resistance is my understanding correct can ac circuits really function without complete loop more importantly what are the equations that govern this if larger isolated conductors really offer less ac resistance than smaller ac conductors how is this resistance computed quantified would its cause be considered inductance or something else
74666 im reading about quantum anomalies in qft and all the examples seem to arise in gauge theories is it true that theories without local gauge invariance dont have quantum anomalies cant think of examples of symmetry violation in any non gauge theories particularly the free theories then again there might be well known example im not aware of
74780 it is often said that the classical charge becomes the quantum generator after quantization indeed this is certainly the case for simple examples of energy and momentum but why should this be the case mathematically for clarity lets assume we are doing canonical quantization so that poisson brackets become commutators assume that the reason has something to do with the relationship between classical hamiltonian mechanics and schrodingers equation perhaps theres simple formulation of noethers theorem in the classical hamiltonian setting which makes the quantum analogy precisely clear any hints or references would be much appreciated mathematical background in classical mechanics continuous transformation of the lagrangian which leaves the action invariant is called symmetry it yields conserved charge according to noethers theorem remains unchanged throughout the motion of the system in quantum mechanics continuous transformation is effected through representation of lie group on hilbert space of states we insist that this representation is unitary or antiunitary so that probabilities are conserved continuous transformation which preserves solutions of schrodingers equation is called symmetry it is easy to prove that this is equivalent to uh for all representing the transformation where is the hamiltonian operator we can equivalently view continuous transformation as the conjugation action of unitary operator on the space of hermitian observables of the theory mapsto uau dagger where in this immediately yields representation of the lie algebra on the space of observables mapsto xa delta textrm where in mathfrak textrm and ix textrm and delta is typically called generator clearly if describes symmetry then will be conserved quantity in the time evolution of the quantum system edit ive had thought that maybe its related to the hamiltonian vector fields for functions on symplectic manifold presumably after quantization these can be associated to the lie algebra generators acting on wavefunctions on the manifold does this sound right to anyone
74892 if radio could produce waves in the visible light spectrum what would the result be this is thought experiment that ive pondered for few years now realize there are few many real world constraints but if we lifted these constraints for the sake of thought what could we expect personally dont see why we wouldnt observe visible light emitting from the antenna disregarding any light from blackbody radiation
75032 once discussed cars and there was question about rate at which the car gains its speed mathrm km from standstill acceleration at some point of conversation it came up that cars cannot gain their mathrm km speed for such tiny time interval proposed less than seconds because it cant go with acceleration more than free fall accel on earth we talked about wheel driven vehicles not rocket driven and all we know that at certain acceleration value the wheels lose their grip with ground and vehicle is not moving forward its burning tyres istead was disagree feel intuitively that the critical acceleration for the wheel traction exists but it couldnt be equal to or approaching to because it should look like some deep law of the nature between friction and acceleration and this phenomenon would be widely known but couldnt find anything we started searching for contra evidence found bugatti veyron which achieves mathrm km speed roughly for and some formula cars but the sources of acceleration values were considered as non reliable and not proven know that the friction and cohesion proccesses are very untrivial it brings electromagnetic interactions between atoms and molecules on microscopic level as well as surface geometry on macrolevel that was another my argument against the statement that acceleration cant be more than without traction loss because such complex and heterogeneous process as wheel traction cant have such simple solution and equal to so could someone prove it or provide formula or methods to show that critical acceleration of wheel driven body without traction loss could be more than or less
75222 would like to know where gravity gets its energy to attract physical bodies know that the law of conservation states that total energy of an isolated system cannot change so gravity has to be getting its energy from somewhere or else things like hydropower plants wouldnt be able to turn the power of the falling water into spinning rotor just to be clear lets create an example lets say we have two objects with equal mass close to each other so gravity does its job and it pulls each other closer this gets turned into kinetic energy this is where im lost according to the law of conservation energy cant be created or destroyed and the kinetic energy comes from the gravitational pull so where does the gravitational pull gets its energy if that energy isnt being recycled from some where else then that means you have just created energy therefore breaking the law of conservation
75229 heres an interesting proof that there is no such thing as magnetism know the answer but love this so much had to ask it here its great way to confuse people as we all know nabla cdot vec using the divergence theorem we find iint vec cdot hat ds iiint nabla cdot vec dv since vec has zero divergence there exist vector function vec such that vec nabla times vec combining the last two equations we get iint hat cdot nabla times vec ds applying stokes theorem we find oint vec cdot hat ds iint hat cdot nabla times vec ds therefore vec is path independent and we can write vec nabla psi for some scalar function psi since the curl of the gradient of function is zero we arrive at vec nabla times nabla psi which means that all magnetic fields are zero but that cant be can you see where we went wrong
75349 in ap physics learned that when changing magnetic flux generates an electromotive force around loop and emf is measured in volts where are the high and low points to measure the potential difference also how is electromagnetic induction consistent to the conservation of energy
75363 wave equations take the form frac partial partial nabla 2f but the schroedinger equation takes the form hbar frac partial partial frac hbar 2m nabla 2f ux the partials with respect to time are not the same order how can schroedingers equation be regarded as wave equation and why are interference patterns in the double slit experiment so similar for water waves and quantum wavefunctions
75465 when boil water in the kettle it makes nice cup of tea sometimes need to use microwave because kettle isnt available boil the water in the mug and it looks pretty normal but when drop in the teabag the water froths up and looks foamy dont see what the chemical difference is here so assume it must be some physical difference have noticed this with multiple types of tea and multiple microwaves the results being consistent so its not just weird microwave or something like that what is the reaction here and how why does it occur here is photo of the fizzy looking tea just after dunking in the teabag
75471 as child imagined this device which may seem to rotate indefinitely have two questions is this perpetual motion machine already known if it is could you please give some references what is the exact mechanism that makes it stop by this mean an explanation not simply because it would break law of energy conservation of course energy conservation is true and this machine cannot work indefinitely but for any known presumed perpetual mobile there was an explanation usually based on showing that the force generating the motion is balanced by another force for example stevin obtained the laws of the inclined plane from the perpetual motion device would like to make some observations dont try to convince anyone that it will move forever because dont believe in breaking the energy conservation it is true that great physicists like bohr kramers and slater admitted the possibility and nowadays some who think that there may be energy exchanges between parallel worlds in mwi believe but dont but dont consider an enough explanation simply to refer to the energy conservation am interested in an explanation showing exactly how the magnetic forces making it rotate are balanced if the forces are balanced only then friction will make it slow down and stop dont think that we can explain only by referring to friction which in principle can be made as small as needed there has to be balance of forces why spending time trying to understand or explain something that admittedly cant work well even though perpetual motion machines cannot actually work think they may be interesting as puzzles
75557 let us define the magnetic field vec frac vec for some constant how can we show that the divergence of this field correspond to the charge distribution of single magnetic pole monopole edit if calculate the divergence get begin align nabla cdot vec nabla cdot leftg frac vec right left nabla frac right cdot vec frac left nabla cdot vec right left frac vec right cdot vec frac 3g frac 3g frac end align which contradicts that there is sink or source of magnetic flux
75576 suppose there is dc mathrm battery connected with times10 mathrm omega resistor then the amount of circuit current is mathrm according to ohms law know the formula iv which is electrical power finally got the electrical power of mathrm in this case cant believe this how can single dc 5v battery generate watts of power what am missing
75605 in stat mech we calculated the radial distribution function pair correlation function for classical gas by using perturbation theory for the bbgky hierarchy could post more details of the calculation if you want but it is rather long winded but standard perturbation theory type calculation the result we got was mathrm ur left int mathrm 3r frf vec vec right where ur is the interaction potential is the temprature is the density and fr mathrm ur is the mayer function roughly measures the probability of finding two particles seperated by distance is the small parameter of the perturbation theory if you then apply this result to hard sphere infinite repulsive potential of diameter you get this now it makes perfect sense that is zero for also the asymptote to one at large is part of the definition of meaning that particles are uncorrelated at large distances the problem is the peak at sim which implies that you are more likely to find particles clustered together despite the complete absence of any attractive forces why is that our lecturer seems to think it is because when two particles collide they stop then bounce hence spending more time in the vicinity of each other than for an ideal gas but this seems dubious because perfect hard sphere collisions are instantaneous can imagine three possibilities this argument could be formalized as limit of soft sphere scattering and is the correct explanation of the correlation there is some other presumably entropic explanation the correlation doesnt exist the perturbation theory gives qualitatively wrong picture seems unlikely in this case so what is it
75619 popular assumption about black holes is that their gravity grows beyond any limit so it beats all repulsive forces and the matter collapses into singularity is there any evidence for this assumption why cant some black holes be just bigger neutron stars with bigger gravity with no substantial difference except for preventing light to escape and if neutrons collapse can they transform into some denser matter like quark gluon plasma with strong interaction powerful enough to stop the gravity in this video stars are approaching supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy in fraction of parsec the tidal force should tear them apart but it doesnt can there be some kind of repulsive force creating limits for attractive forces
75753 was watching scott manley video on youtube and he mentioned that the sun was loosing million tons of mass second as it converts to energy with few trillion trillion stars also converting mass to energy wonder if that would be component to the missing dark matter mass im complete layperson here just very interested in astronomy and the physics involved
75911 imagine black hole that is fast approaching its final exponential throws of hawking evaporation presumably at all points in this end process there there will remain region that identifiably remains the black hole until the the very end as opposed to huge swarm of fundamental particles that is being radiated out from it as the mass of the black hole descends to that of individual particles it would seem entirely feasible that the very last fermionic hawking radiation event available to the almost deceased black hole could leave it with an unbalanced charge and an unbalanced spin say it would also have some kind of mass of course but that aspect of the final residue could be fine tuned to any specific value by photon emissions of arbitrary frequencies after photon emission mass trimming the resulting black hole residuum would reach point where it is no longer be able to evaporate into any known particle because there is no longer any lower mass option available to it for removing the charge and spin the black hole residuum will at that point be stuck so to speak stuck with exact charge spin and mass features of an electron and so my question is it an electron and if so by equivalence is every electrons in the universe really just particular type of black hole that cannot evaporate any further due to the constraints of charge and spin conservation and if so why are charge and spin so uniquely combined in such black hole remnants so that remnant of charge and zero spin is not permitted at least not commonly and the mass is forced to very specific associated level is there anything in the current understanding of general relativity that would explain such curious set of restrictions on evaporation the full generalization of this idea would of course be that all forms of black hole evaporation are ultimately constrained in ways that correspond exactly to the standard model with free fundamental particles like electrons being the only stable end states of the evaporation process the proton would be fascinating example of an evaporation that remains incomplete in more profound way with the three quarks remaining incapable of isolated existence within spacetime the strong force from that perspective would in some odd sense have to be curious unbalanced remnant of those same deeper constraints on the overall gravitational evaporation process this may all be tautological too that is since hawking radiation is guided by the particles possible the constraints just mentioned may be built in and thus entirely trivial in nature however something deeper in the way they work together would seem plausible at least if an electron is an unbalanced black hole then the particles given off would also be black holes and the overall process would be not one of just particle emission but of how black holes split at low masses splitting with constraints imposed by the structure of spacetime itself would be rather different way of looking at black hole evaporation suspect final note this is just passing thought that ive mulled over now and then through the years asking it was inspired by this intriguing mention of wheelers geon concept by ben crowell should add that doubt very seriously that that my wild speculations above have anything to do with wheelers concept of geons though
75945 alternatively why does the force created by blowing out air feel so much stronger than the force created by sucking in air ok so forget the human factor involved in blowing out candles consider vacuum cleaner with suction end and blower end anyone who has tried it out notices the blower end creates much stronger force than the suction end despite the discharge being more or less equal at both ends why does this happen
76096 is u1 times su2 times su3 vector space over field saw an article here that seemed to me that similar concept to field extension was being used in qft is each particle considered to be its own vector space and are the individual vector spaces then bridged together by these group extensions if have asked too many questions feel free to respond to just one
76162 many documentaries regarding the double slit experiment state that they only send single photon through the slit how is that achieved and can it really be ensured that it is single photon
76299 have been going through some problems in sakurais modern qm and at one point have to calculate langle alpha hat alpha rangle where all we know about the state alpha rangle is that langle alpha rangle fx for some known function alpha rangle is gaussian wave packet sakurai says that this is given by langle rangle int limits infty infty langle alpha rangle left hbar frac partial partial right langle alpha rangle dx am wondering how we get to this expression know that we can express alpha rangle int dx rangle langle alpha rangle and langle alpha int dx langle alpha rangle langle so my thinking is that we have langle alpha hat alpha rangle iint dx dx langle alpha rangle langle hat rangle langle alpha rangle and if we can commute rangle and hat this would become iint dxdx langle alpha rangle hat langle rangle langle alpha rangle which is the desired result as langle rangle deltax is this approach valid think my question boils down to does the operator hat act on the basis kets rangle or on their coefficients in the latter case if we had some state psi rangle rangle for some position then would we say that for this state langle rangle langle left hbar frac partial partial right rangle as the single coefficient is and the derivative of is
76366 ive always been confused by this very very basic and important fact about two dimensional cfts hope can get satisfactory explanation here in classical cft the generators of the conformal transformation satisfy the witt algebra ell ell ell in the quantum theory the same generators satisfy different algebra hat ell hat ell hat ell frac hbar delta m0 why is this how come we dont see similar things for other algebras for example why isnt the poincare algebra modified when going from classical to quantum theory please try to be as descriptive as possible in your answer
76770 saw the following definition for the partial trace operator rho sum langle rho ab rangle where is basis for the state space of system from what know in the dirac notation the meaning of langle rangle is the inner product of the vectors rangle and rangle so have two problems with this notation of the partial trace first how can an inner product be an operator an inner product should be complex number so guess that inner product represents an operator somhow second what is the meaning of rho ab rangle rho ab is mapping on the space otimes but is vector from the space so dont really know how to interpret the meaning of this notation
76835 does spinning an object make it heavier real world example was mowing the lawn in front of my house lawn that tends to have some steep inclines realized that the lawn mower was easier to move and much easier to pull up inclines when it was off than when it was running the only difference between lawn mower thats running and one that is isnt is that the blade is rotating and theres some electricity running through it as it uses up gas guess the most significant of those would be the spinning blade does the spinning blade make the lawn mower heavier as whole object and would that mean that spinning objects are heavier than non spinning objects
76939 recently read that quantum state is actually defined by ray and not vector that is it is possible to multiply state psi by any complex number in mathbb and you wont be changing the physics in any way understand this mathematically but dont understand what the physical meaning of such an equivalent state would be since the new state need not be normalised if is not of the form phi
76978 in each of the uncertainty relations delta delta geq hbar delta delta geq hbar delta delta geq hbar delta delta geq hbar the second term on the left side is one of the compoments of position vector while the first term seems to be the corresponding component of the momentum energy vector the proper time derivative of the position component multiplied by the invariant mass does this have any deeper whatever that means physical significance or something else is going on here im perfectly aware that this might be silly question but im still learning both quantum and spacetime physics and never had to deal with the intersection between those two so would appreciate simple clarification
77038 as is usually done when first presenting string theory the nambu goto action text ng int tau sigma sqrt det alpha beta is the induced metric on the world sheet and is positive real number interpreted as the string tension is introduced as the natural generalization of action for relativistic point particle which in turn is obviously correct action as it produces the proper equations of motion and has nice geometric interpretation not long after the introduction of the nambu goto action authors tend to introduce the polyakov action begin align text frac int tau sigma sqrt alpha beta alpha beta frac int tau sigma sqrt alpha beta partial alpha cdot partial beta frac int tau sigma sqrt alpha beta partial alpha kappa partial beta lambda kappa lambda end align where kappa lambda is the space time metric alpha beta is the induced metric on the world sheet and alpha beta is the auxiliary metric on the world sheet det alpha beta they then usually proceed to show that these two actions are equivalent in the sense that you can deduce the equations of motion for text ng given the equations of motion for text now thats all well and dandy but that doesnt exactly show how one would actually arrive at the polyakov action you cant make it as theoretical physicist by mindlessly computing things to show you get the right answer you have to be able to actually you know come up with things hence instead of just pulling the polyakov action out of hat it would be nice to know way of deriving or motivating the action so then imagine you are handed text ng and you set out to come up with an equivalent action that at the very least doesnt involve square root how do you come up with the polyakov action
77053 have come across many websites that states that the proton proton fusion which is the dominant type of fusion that powers the suns is extremely slow and that is why the sun is still burning to that day but also have read that the sun fuses million tons of hydrogen every second so that is considered fast for us on the earth scale so my question now is comparing the time it takes to release the same amount of energy how much faster the fusion for example is compared to proton proton fusion
77368 ive seem the notion of bundles fiber bundles connections on bundles and so on being used in many different places on physics now in mathematics bundle is introduced to generalize the topological product describe spaces that globally are not products but that locally are in geometry we use this idea to introduce the notion of vectors into manifold and so on now what is the connection of this mathematical intuition and the importance that bundles have in physics the point is that there are many objects that we naturally see how they fit into physics manifolds intuitively can be viewed as abstract spaces where we can put coordinates in smooth manner and do calculus so its very natural that whenever we need coordinates therell probably be manifold involved now with bundles im failing to see this intuition
77373 how is it proved to be always true its fundamental principle in physics that is based on all of our currents observations of multiple systems in the universe is it always true to all systems because we havent tested or observed them all would it be possible to discover create system that could lead to different result how are we sure that energy is always conserved finally why did we conclude its always conversed what if system keeps doing work over and over and over with time
77384 for paulis exclusion principle to be followed by fermions we need these anti commutators lambda lambda and lambda dagger lambda dagger then lambda lambda dagger lambda lambda dagger lambda lambda dagger left1 lambda dagger lambda righta lambda lambda dagger lambda lambda which gives lambda here we used the anti commutator lambda lambda prime dagger delta lambda lambda prime but we could have used even commutator instead of the anti commutator and still got the same result if we choose lambda lambda prime dagger delta lambda lambda prime then lambda lambda dagger lambda lambda dagger lambda lambda dagger left1 lambda dagger lambda righta lambda lambda dagger lambda lambda which also gives lambda what conditions make us impose the last anti commutation relation lambda lambda prime dagger delta lambda lambda prime instead of lambda lambda prime dagger delta lambda lambda prime mean we do not need all relations to be anti commuting can take of them to be anti commuting but the third one relation between creation and annihilation operator to be commuting and still maintain the paulis exclusion
77410 by definition scalar fields are independent of coordinate system thus would expect scalar field psi would not change under the transformation mu to mu epsilon mu correct now when look in the book introduction to qft by peskin and schroeder they state in an example that the scalar field psi under an infinitesimal coordinate transformation mu to mu mu transforms as psi to psi psi mu partial mu psi one possible solution thought was that scalar field to mathcal from variety in this case spacetime is invariant under coordinate transformations but that the coordinate representation psi does change under coordinate transformations obviously is this anywhere near correct
77495 what are coherence and quantum entanglement does it mean that two particles are the same read this in book called physics of the impossible by michio kaku he says that two particles behave in the same way even if they are separated he also says that this is helpful in teleportation how can this be possible could somebody please explain
77558 when launching rockets into space they start straight but begin to lean assume due to the earths rotation for something on much smaller scale such as golf tee is there measurable trajectory alteration or is it something so incredibly minuscule that theres virtually no effect
77606 kind of an odd random question that popped into my head tidal energy earths ocean movement volcanism on some of jupiters moons etc obviously comes from the gravitational interaction between large bodies on earth the interactions with the moon are pulling water around the surface creating some amount of heat due to friction etc my question is where does that energy come from exactly more specifically what potential energy source is getting depleted to do that work is the earth minutely slowing down in its spin or are the orbits of earth and the moon subtly altered over time by the counteractive movement and friction of liquids and gasses
77641 in dimensionless analysis coefficients of quantities which have the same unit for numerator and denominator are said to be dimensionless feel the word dimensionless is actually wrong and should be replaced by of dimension number for example the mach number is of dimension one many people write for this case mach number dimension unit as mentioned before would say dimension in this place but what about the unit text text divided by text text is equal to one but is the number one unit by definition or should one say that the mach number has no unit and therefore unit

78118 as understand it from lay physics perspective quantum entanglement has been experimentally demonstrated it is reality as understand it you can measure something like the spin of an electron and know that its entangled pair will in that same instant no matter where in the universe it is have the opposite spin this would not seem to have any utility as the foundation of superluminal communications device is this true or has it been established that is there some aspect of quantum entanglement that can ultimately lead to the development of such device in other words is superluminal communication via quantum entanglement an open scientific question has it been settled as an impossibility or is it currently more of an engineering problem than scientific one

78419 im reading and working my way through plasmonics fundamentals by stefan maier and ive come across step in the workings that im struggling to understand when working out the electromagnetic field equations at dielectric conductor interface at the stage im stuck there are six coupled equations for the field components of vec and vec the book proceeds to say this system of equations allows only two sets of self consistent solutions one where only and are nonzero transverse magnetic modes and one where only and are nonzero transverse electric modes how has this conclusion been reached how has this been solved to prove that there are two sets of solutions where certain components are zero any pointers on how can start figuring this out are very much appreciated edit these equations can be reduced to those below by substituting and into appropriate corresponding equation partial omega mu partial ich partial omega epsilon epsilon partial ice which further reduce to two wave equations new question further clarification needed so ive got this far but still cant understand why this produces two sets of self consistent solutions one where only and are nonzero transverse magnetic modes and one where only and are nonzero transverse electric modes
78442 am trying to understand intuitively what phonon is but for the moment find it quite difficult having limited background in quantum mechanics an undergraduate course in non relativistic qm in fact find it hard to formulate good questions so hope my questions below make some sense read that phonons are the quantum mechanical analog of normal modes of vibration in crystalline system of atoms or molecules so guess superposition general vibration should also be phonon is that so why would they then be described as normal modes could we say that phonon is particle whose position wave function extends over the whole crystal are the quantum mechanical frequency and wave vector the same as the frequency and wave vector of the corresponding classical oscillation vibration in the crystal in what sense is it like particle in that it is always observed or it always interacts at specific location

78684 every so often one sees on this site or in the news or in journal articles statement of the form we have measured change in such and such fundamental constant or perhaps more commonly we have constrained the rate of change of these are often shrouded in controversy with people often stating quite loudly that statements of the sort are meaningless and even unverifiable but the end result is often quite confusing thus is it possible to speak about changes to physical constant that contains dimensional information if not why not these are some examples but theres more example example

79101 in standard non wilsonian renormalization we split the bare lagrangian mathcal into physical lagrangian mathcal with measurable couplings and masses counterterms mathcal ct with divergent couplings we then calculate with the bare lagrangian perturbatively to cutoff lambda adjusting the counterterms so that its valid to take the continuum limit in the wilsonian theory we start with lagrangian mathcal and scale lambda we suppose mathcal is small perturbation to some fixed point of the renormalization group flow using the renormalization group we deduce an effective lagrangian mathcal eff at some scale mu lambda we then take the limit lambda to infty what do we calculate with in the wilsonian theory is it the case that mathcal eff mathcal from the standard renormalization theory if so why example in phi theory we have mathcal frac partial mu phi frac 0m phi frac lambda 0z phi mathcal frac partial mu phi frac phi frac lambda phi mathcal ct frac delta partial mu phi frac delta delta phi frac delta lambda delta phi have no idea what mathcal and mathcal eff are though and no book peskin and schroeder deligne and witten etc seems to explain it my guess is as follows mathcal frac partial mu phi frac lambda phi textrm all interactions and that at fixed mu we have mathcal eff to mathcal as lambda to infty have no real reason to think this though and still less idea how to prove it
79146 laser uses mirrors to reflect photons in order to stimulate atoms to emit photons but why this is so mean why does photon stimulate atoms to produce more photons if photon made an atom to produce photon is not the first photon absorbed by the atom and therefore there is not total gain in the process
79331 the title says it all if was on bus at km and started walking on the bus at steady pace of km then id technically be moving at km right so my son posed me an interesting question today since light travels as fast as anything can go what if shined light when moving in car how should answer his question
79355 my understanding though its from science channel show so im not sure if it is correct is that there is fusion reaction happening in the center of the sun atomic nuclei are being created and fused into higher atomic weights from lower atomic weights by the time this reaction gets to iron on the periodic table billions of years the iron atoms are too heavy to allow the reaction to continue so the star collapses and goes supernova within short time is this true if so can comet made of iron enter the suns core and destroy it how much iron would it take or do just have an inaccurate understanding entirely possible note do not intend to try to destroy the sun
79392 we use stimulated emission and not spontaneous emission to produce lasers why is this cant we produce lasers by the spontaneous emission method
79426 long ago learned that plasma was distinct state of matter after solid liquid and gas and also that it was achieved by imparting heat to the matter but most references describe plasma as an ionized gas so im having trouble understanding what then does it mean to be distinct phase of matter is ionization as opposed to heat all thats required to make gas plasma if so what makes plasma more distinguished than say an ionized liquid
79733 have took discrete mathematics course this summer and there we talked about power of groups and functionsand yesterday though and realize that if we can map all the 3d coordinates with one on one and surjective function from xyz to we can prove that our planet is 1d thats mind blowing is that proof is right
79787 dont have lot of knowledge of special relativity and associated topics some of the few things know are that all motion is relative that is there is no stationary reference frame and the speed of light in vacuum simeq cdot mathrm is the absolute asymptotic speed limit asymptotic meaning that you can never equal it only get arbitrarily close what escapes me is how those concepts work together to my naive understanding an object would never move in its own reference frame and so would never reach what reference frame is measured against is it measured against reference frame or am looking at this the wrong way
79860 while ago tried to charge glow in the dark sticker using simple red laser pointer it was large sticker of the type used to mark emergency exits and fire extinguishers here in germany thought could draw picture this way with glowing strokes to my surprise the exact opposite happened the sticker was already glowing little bit and the areas illuminated with my laser turned dark instantly as if the charge of the sticker was removed by the laserlight the effect was reversible the darkened areas would charge and glow as usual if exposed to normal light so was able to draw picture after all however it was negative can anyone explain why the sticker was discharged instead of charged by the laserlight
79878 wheel rolling down hill has two axis of rotation one is where the center or mass is and the other is the point of contact with the surface which acts as fulcrum was trying to understand how this happens how it rotates down the hill what causes friction and torque please mind me over this simple issue but just want to further understand how things work my ideas are as follow f1 the component of gravity pulls the wheel from the center of mass cm this pull will create friction friction then creates torque about its center of mass the object is at the same time rotating around the point where it touches the surface like fulcrum the torque is created with lever arm and force dont know if this is right or not maybe one should not consider the component of gravity at all acting on the wheel if so what is rotation originated is it because the position of the cm maybe someone can explain better

80043 the principle behind fibre optic cable is that light is reflected along the cable until it reaches the other side like in this diagram although know that the light is slowed down somewhat because its not going through air ive always wondered about another factor what about the fact that the light path is zig zagged rather than straight doesnt that significantly increase the distance that the light has to travel if so by how much does it slow down the time the light takes to travel through the cable

80166 understand how if the riemann tensor is in all its components since we construct the ricci tensor by contracting the riemann ricci tensor would be in all components as well ive read that vanishing of the ricci tensor in spacetime dimensions implies the vanishing of the riemann curvature tensor but that in higher dimensions that does not hold can somebody explain why is that so is it because we have more independent components of the riemann tensor in spacetime dimension than in vs also if the number of independent components of riemann tensor in spacetime dimensions is nn frac 2n and since we know that the riemann tensor has components does that limit the spacetime dimensions of its usage or does that mean that for example in spacetime dimensions there wont be any independent components of riemann tensor
80181 it seems to be commonly accepted that the big bang occurred roughly billion years ago my question is what is the meaning of the year in this context when type year definition into google it returns this the age of the earth likewise is accepted billion years im assuming that by years old we mean earth years now if the earth only existed for billion years what is the meaning of the year before the earth existed why is the age of the universe even expressed in years as opposed to something like distance it appears that billion earth years is completely meaningless since year depends on the existence of the earth
80221 since photon has no restmass and pc mc we derive that pc for particle with no restmass however if we transform the non relativistic formula for kinetic energy frac mv frac 2m lim rightarrow0 frac 2m lim rightarrow0 frac 2v 2m lim rightarrow0 frac mv frac pv we derive that frac pc and this is bizarre because im expecting ive just started learning physics recently so im pretty sure ive got certain part wrong and here are my hypotheses the net energy of photon net pc is equivalent net frac pc and thus pc frac pc if thats true what exactly is the rest energy of photon it is incorrect to derive the kinetic energy formula from integrating the equation frac mathrm de mathrm dv mv should integrate another equation instead perhaps frac mathrm de mathrm dv if thats true why do we break into mv when deriving the formula frac pc got the limit wrong lim rightarrow0 frac 2m ne frac pc lim rightarrow0 frac 2m pc so is any of these hypothesis correct and why

80256 it is said that iron fusion is endothermic and star cant sustain this kind of fusion not until it goes supernova however star is constantly releasing energy from fusion of elements like hydrogen and helium so cant that energy be used for fusion of iron nuclei
80365 will try to be as explanatory as possible with my question please also note that have done my share of googling and am looking for simple language preferable with some example so that can get some insight in this subject my question is what is so special about why only its like chicken and egg puzzle for me does einstein reached to observing light or does he got to light using some number which turned out equal to why is not relative if something has zero rest mass like photon why they only travel at in vacuum and not with or
80390 since neutrinos have small mass and are affected by gravity wouldnt it be theoretically possible to have such large quantity of them so close to each other that they would form kind of stellar object one that would keep itself from dissolving due to the large gravity if such objects were possible how would they interact with rest of the world would they be invisible dark matter because of neutrinos lack of electromagnetic charge would this lack also make ordinary matter pass through them or would the pauli exclusion principle prevent this passing through due to the high density of neutrinos
80434 according to wikipedia if system has chance to be in state left psi right and to be in state left psi right then this is mixed state now consider the state left psi right frac left psi right left psi right sqrt which is superposition of the states left psi right and left psi right let left psi right be eigenstates of the hamiltonian operator then measurements of energy will give chance of it being and of being but this then corresponds to the definition above of mixed state however superposition is defined to be pure state so what is the mistake here what is the real difference between mixed state and superposition of pure states

80707 have read about how electromagnetic waves propagate and what surmise is that when charged particles such as electrons accelerate they produce time varying electric fields these electric fields produce magnetic fields and the process goes on are the em fields really moving my textbook says its changes in the field that is moving dont understand this part if em waves are just changes in electric fields that seem to propagate along space have seen people on this site saying it happens because of continuous induction of electric and magnetic fields how can relate both of these ideas

80807 know plus pushes another plus away but why really do they do that on the other hand molecules of the same type are attracted to each other find that weird do know some stuff about four universal forces but why in general the general rule is that opposite charges pull each other yes do realize this could be connected to very basic stuff that science is still trying to figure out and can be traced to the higgs but still there must be something to tell
80932 is it an accurate statement to say that free electrons in metal experience no restoring force when they interact with electromagnetic waves understand that the electrons exist in space filled with ions and doesnt the cumulative potential that is present due to the presence of the ions exert an electric field on the electrons even in the case of simple metals where you can say that the nucleus is shielded by the valence electrons so called coulomb shielding how significant is the shielding naively it seems to me that because the charge in the nucleus is not balanced by the charge in the bound electrons there should be some net potential that the free electron sees

81056 am physics student and my dad just asked me about the higgs boson ive told him the little know that the higgs field is field that is supposed to give mass to elementary particles and that finding the boson was crucial to see if this mechanism actually did exist after telling that question has come into my mind have heard that it is very difficult to create the circumstances where we would have higgs bosons have been told also that this boson is the carrier of the field responsible of giving mass to other particles so the question is quite natural to me how come something which is not there in normal conditions happens to do its work mean the carrier of the electromagnetic force are the photons and we have photons in normal conditions by this have meant not the conditions we have inside the lch for example so it is natural to see their effects but how is this possible with the higgs

81221 depending on the theories the center of our galaxy is super massive black hole this is easy to accept as truth but what couldnt simply devour is how the solar system is orbiting around it while not getting absorbed to the inside its simple to understand how earth orbits the sun but the black hole is something more energetic and at most pulls everything to its center by looking to this image for example if we follow the bright lines it looks like everything is really going to the true center like vortex if you have any simple ways to enlighten me or any references to read will be thankful because sometimes dont know what topic should search for to find answers without posting questions like this one and also would our galaxy run out of stars since the black hole devours them fast while they take too long to reproduce

81656 ive been digging lot into quantum physics in the last few weeks didnt care much about the maths just about what empirically happens to get conceptual idea about quantum phenomena the most widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics seems to be the copenhagen one if got it right its heavily relaying on the two following principles among others superposition quantum system is at the same time in all the states it could possibly be in when its measured it instantaneously collapses in single state entanglement aka spooky action at distance if two or more quantum systems are entangled it means that some of their properties are correlated when measuring system all the entangled ones collapse in state coherent to the measured one simultaneously no matter how far away they are to each other im not able to believe it it allows some unrealistic paradoxes schr dingers cat paradox and have the feeling that this interpretation and its consequences is what makes quantum mechanics look so weird mysterious unnatural and spooky to the public besides ive read from few sources like this google tech talk that this interpretation has proven to be broken the math says everything is continuous and doesnt hint to anything like collapsing and even more important the quantum eraser experiment contradicts the copenhagen interpretation the second most popular interpretation many worlds sounds lot more natural to me although it strongly smells like science fiction believe there must be many interpretations that would hold better and would be lot less weird than the two mentioned ones what im wondering is then why does the copenhagen interpretation and to lesser degree the many worlds one remain the most accredited one

81754 hamiltonian dynamics fulfil the liouvilles theorem which means that one can imagine the flux of phase space volume under hamiltonian theory like the flux of an ideal fluid which doesnt change its volume but is it possible to reproduce every phase space conserving flux with an appropriate hamiltonian so can simply imagine the entity of all possible hamiltonian dynamics as all possible phase space conserving fluxes or are hamiltonian dynamics special case for phase space conserving fluxes if they are special case what would be an example for phase space conserving flux for which there is no hamiltonian that can produce it

82429 in lab my ta charged large circular parallel plate capacitor to some voltage she then disconnected the power supply and used electrometer to read the voltage about 10v she then pulled the plates apart and to my surprise saw that the voltage increased with distance her explanation was that the work she did increased the potential energy that consequently increases the voltage between the plates but the electric field remains constant although tried to get more of physical explanation out of her she was unable to give me one can someone help me here
82678 this question was prompted by can matter really fall through an event horizon notoriously if you calculate the schwarzschild coordinate time for anything matter or light to reach the event horizon the result is infinite this implies that the universe ages by an infinite time before someone falling into the black hole reaches the event horizon so could that person see the universe age by an infinite time to be more precise suppose the observer starts falling from rest at time and some initial distance if we wait for some time then shine light ray at the falling observer will the light ray always reach the falling observer before they cross the event horizon if not what is the formula for the longest time that we can wait and still be sure the ray will catch the observer if is not bounded it implies that observer could indeed see the end of the universe can think of qualitative argument for an upper limit on but im not sure how sound my argument is the proper time for the observer to fall to the event horizon is finite call this tau the proper time for the light ray to release the horizon is zero therefore the light ray will reach the observer before they cross the event horizon only if tau hence is bounded and the observer wont see the end of the universe think more rigorous approach would be to determine the equations of motion in the schwarzschild coordinates for the falling observer and the light ray and then find the condition for the light to reach the falling observer at some distance epsilon from the event horizon then take the limit as epsilon rightarrow in principle this seems straightforward but in practice the algebra rapidly defeated me even for light ray the radial distance time equation isnt closed form wolfram claims it needs the function and for the falling observer the calculation is even harder
82874 apologize if this question is dumb but ive looked all over for straightforward answer and either cant find one or the terms are too complex for me to understand have only rudimentary knowledge of mechanics but do understand basic linear algebra so torque mathematically is the cross product of the radial distance vector and force vector this cross product gives another vector that is orthogonal to both vectors and it points either outside or towards the page in the context of two dimensional diagram assuming this is correct do not understand what it pointing in or out means does it even have phyisical intuitive meaning the best answer ive been able to come up with is that its just mathematical convention with no actual phyisical meaning meant to provide framework within which operations between torque vectors such as addition and substraction make sense am correct or way off the mark here

83105 the equal angles law of refection on flat mirror is macroscopic phenomenon to put it in anthropomorphic terms how do individual photons know the orientation of the mirror so as to bounce off in the correct direction
83141 know the definition of space like and time like intervals how do you show that in some reaction the virtual photons is spacelike timelike on page peskin and schroeder it says since for scattering process why is this statement true dont see it straight away for example in bahba scattering discussed on this page
83190 mass of point performs an effectively dimensional motion in the radial coordinate if we use the conservation of angular momentum the centrifugal potential should be added to the original one the equation of motion can be obtained also from the lagrangian if we substitute however the conserved angular momentum herein then the centrifugal potential arises with the opposite sign so if we naively apply the euler lagrange equation then the centrifugal force appears with the wrong sign in the equations of motion dont know how to resolve this paradox

83307 according to the dirac equation antimatter is the negative energy solution to the following relation and according to general relativity the einstein tensor which roughly represents the curvature of spacetime is linearly dependent on and assume would then have the same mathematical sign as the stress energy tensor mu nu frac pi mu nu for antimatter the sign of the stress energy tensor would change as the sign of the energy changes would this change the sign of the einstein tensor causing spacetime to be curved in the opposite direction as it would be curved if normal matter with positive energy were in its place or does adding in the cosmological constant change things here

83457 im puzzling over the canonical derivation of gr from the einstein hilbert action getting the derivation to gel with an explicit treatment of the functional derivative isnt working out so the derivation drawn here from wikipedia though other literature is similar begins int sqrt 4x left frac kappa mathcal right and immediately proceeds to delta int 4x delta mu nu left frac kappa frac delta left sqrt right delta mu nu frac delta left sqrt mathcal right delta mu nu right but the ricci scalar depends on the first and second derivatives of the metric tensor so why do we not have factors delta mu nu alpha qquad delta mu nu alpha beta against which we vary as well maybe there is some identity that in this case causes these terms to vanish but dont see it

83699 not too long ago someone began to discuss the thinking and motivation behind the lagrangian and its formalism for the newtonian framework and an intuitive understanding of such formalism somehow it ended in the case that the lagrangian can be understood in terms of conservation of information largely without having to rely on other laws is this line of argument correct and more importantly would this mean that unitarity is stronger statement than conservation of energy
83743 this question is about mathematical object the tensor product but thinking about the motivation that comes from physics algebraists motivate the tensor product like that given vector spaces dotsv over the same field bbb we want to find new space and universal multilinear map such that for every vector space and multilinear mapping times cdots times to we have linear map to such that circ then they prove this thing exists by constructing it they take the free vector space mathcal fv times cdots times and consider the subspace mathcal spanned by all elements of the form dotsv av dotsv dotsv dotsv av dotsv dotsv and define mathcal mathcal denoting otimes cdots otimes and define tv dotsv dotsv mathcal and denote this by tv dotsv otimes cdots otimes thats fine but tensors appear lot in physics in general relativity in electrodynamics in classical mechanics in quantum mechanics etc so if someone asked me whats the motivation for that definition of tensor prodct and wished to motivate it through physics what should be the motivation how would convince myself that the tensor product as defined like that is useful in physics know that one can defined tensors as multilinear maps and that is far mor intuitive however im interest to see how one would motivate this definition
83781 according to the haag lopuszanski sohnius theorem the most general symmetry that consistent dimensional field theory can enjoy is supersymmery seen as an extension of poincar symmetry in direct product with the internal gauge symmetry but we know that conformal theories having as symmetry group the conformal group which is indeed an extension of the poincar group in direct product with the internal gauge group exist also there exist superconformal theories which enjoy both conformal symmetry supersymmetry and gauge internal symmetry all this theories are consistent from theoretical point of view and well definite in therefore ask how does superconformal field theories avoid the haag lopuszanski sohnius theorem

86141 let us say that am sitting in room with all the drapes open bright sunlight is coming through the window the whole room is brilliantly lighted will not be able to see the dust particles suspended in air now if draw the drapes close keeping small slit open allowing only beam of sunlight to come in will readily see the suspended dust particles in that beam the same thing will happen in dark night with the beam of light from handheld battery torch what will be the scientific explanation for this can not see the dust particles when have more light but when actually reduce the light and there is only one narrow beam present can see those minuscule particles how does narrow beam of light enable me to see those fine elements
86233 know that under su2 times su2 the left handed electron transforms under frac representation and the vector gauge field mu under frac frac since the electron transforms under u1 there must be represenation under which it transforms what is this representation does it have name apparenly mu does not transform under the same representation which would mean alphax mu but instead as mu partial mu alphax what representation is this of course realize that the transformation of mu cant be different for the lagrangian to be invariant but that shouldnt be used to define the it

86593 thought for fun might measure how my ceiling fan slows down when turned off and maybe find out what forces act on it when it slows down my problem is that for that need to measure its rotational speed when its turned on when its in the lowest speeds its easy because you can see it rotate but for higher speeds thats not an option thought one way would be to use strobe light and try to match up the frequency but dont have one of those can you think of any diy way to measure the speed of very fast ceiling fan
86688 so lets assume that the laser gun phaser beam weapon from all sorts of sci fi were an actual thing you know weapon that uses laser to kill somebody im trying to imagine the physics of such device and two issues make me think that the real world physics of the thing make it an impossibility even if you could get laser to be that small in reality the beam should keep travelling too far to be safe right so if you fire normal gun and miss your target the bullet continues to travel for bit while there is disagreement as to how far there is still pretty good reason why you build firing range against hill stray bullet can still kill at considerable distance with light however dont see anything that would stop the beam if gravity were to affect said beam and one question have is would it it would seem that the speed of light unlike star wars special effect would mean that the bullet should be able to travel around the entire earth more than times in less than second while bullet is clearly going to hit the ground due to gravity within space of less than mile wonder how long would it take laser beam to dissipate since light has speed that exceeds escape velocity cant see that gravity actually pulls the beam to the ground my question is does the beam continue in straight line eventually leaving the atmosphere and going off into space or would the curvature of the earth keep the beam orbitting the earth for some time and how far would such beam go at certain distance would assume that orbitting spacecraft would eventually be hit by the beam or if it closely followed the earth it seems like the beam would eventually cause swath of destruction as far as it went so how long would it take for the beam to be dissipated in the air just as matter of course the pulse should be way too long to be tactical right remember admiral grace hopper showing an bit of wire and saying that is how far light would travel in nanosecond her objective of course was to show how fast nanosecond really is applying that to laser however im imagining that no computer could actually be fast enough to actually start and stop laser beam in nanosecond applying that to laser gun and lets assume that it was affected by gravity means that normal person triggering pulse could actually start and stop in 8th of second again at the speed of light that would mean the pulse should theortically be long as the circumference of the entire earth at that point making it tactically impossible to guide in any fashion im curious what rational limit would be for microprocessor would be in terms of time and then how big of bolt that would produce so given just these two considerations length of the bolt in relation to turn on off times and distance that it would travel how would real world laser gun actually work in practice

86774 noticed that when had helium filled latex balloon inside of my car it moved forward in the cabin as accelerated forward the faster accelerated forward the faster the balloon went from the back of the car to the front of the car the balloon didnt have string this became game with my year old as we drove home we figured out where the balloon would go based on how fast accelerated turned corners etc expected that it would act lot like the water in cup does but it was the total opposite it seemed what forces caused this behavior assumed it has something to do with the fluid dynamics in the closed cabin but cant figure it out
86920 as weinberg exposited in his qft vol1 there are two equivalent ways of arriving at the same quantum field theories start with single particle representations of poincare group and then make multiparticle theory out of it while preserving principles of causality etc would call this approach the second quantization of particles since second quantization is usually used to emphasize the many body nature of theory start with field representations of poincare group canonically quantize it while preserving principles of causality positive definiteness of energies etc would call this approach the quantization of fields just as everyone else would call it weinberg showed the proof of the equivalence between the above two approaches using some though not hard but lets say nontrivial mathematics the equivalence seems like sheer miracle to me or complete coincidence do not feel that understand the equivalence with the current state of mind is there way to trivialize the equivalence or putting it another way is there an priori reasoning to argue given the two sets of starting points of we have to get the same theory in the end just as side remark many have suggested the term second quantization should be totally dumped because it is really just the first quantization of fields to me however it still serves some purposes since the equivalence is not transparent
86926 if place mercury thermometer in hot water heat energy will transfer from the water to the mercury inside the thermometer will this continue until thermal equilibrium is reached and thus the mercury will show the temperature of the water however if this is so will the thermometer show the right temperature as some of the heat energy is transferred to the thermometer and this in turn will cause original temperature of water to fall please correct me if am wrong
87065 recently am reading paper about monopoles in several cases it seems that writing fields in adjoint representation of the gauge group makes difference once it leads to different group after symmetry breaking when using other representation and also noticed statement like this an important open question is whether an analogous bogomolny monopoles mass bound can be obtained if the higgs field is not in the adjoint representation can anyone kindly shed light on this thanks update reckon any field either em field in real space or higgs field in internal isotopic space be in certain type of representation space of the symmetry group associated with the lagrangian or action this space also dictates some constraints on the fields specific tensor or spinor structures anything more and what representation space you use contains physics as well that is to say we have to check it by experiments perhaps this question addresses on particular case either does the explicit and concrete 2nd answer is this understanding correct
87107 it is my understanding that metals are crystal lattice of ions held together by delocalized electrons which move freely through the lattice and conduct electricity heat etc if two pieces of the same metal are touched together why dont they bond it seems to me the delocalized electrons would move from one metal to the other and extend the bond holding the two pieces together if the electrons dont move freely from one piece to the other why would this not happen when current is applied through the two pieces
87213 this travel stackexchange answer has kinda got me wondering how long do experiments involving the large hadron collider usually take id expect you run it for few seconds and bam higgs boson detected or whatever maybe itd take few months to set the experiment up but once its setup it doesnt seem like itd take that much time at all to run the experiment mean maybe youd want to run it few times to verify your results but if each run takes just few seconds it seems like you could still be done with your multiple runs even in single day any ideas
87332 according to einstein the space time is curved and the origin of the curvature is the presence of matter the presence of the energy momentum tensor ab in einsteins field equations if our universe were empty ab and the cosmological constant lambda is setted to be then would expect only the flat solution to the vacuum field equations ab surprisingly there are non flat or non trivial solutions to the above equations for example the schwarzschild solution this conflicts with the fact that the matter curves the spacetime so what is the origin of the curvature for these non trivial solutions understand that mathematically ab ricci flatness doesnt imply that the metric is flat non trivial solutions are formally admissible but dont understand how this is explained physically

87534 was asked puzzling question thought experiment given the source of sound in wide open field so acoustics do not play role is it possible for sound to be louder as you move away from it my answer was instinctively no as you move away from sound it dissipates so it should not be louder the response is that if there is another weaker source of sound closer to you then by walking away the source closer to you will lose strength and the source farther will shine through better this doesnt feel right to me surely when you move away from the sound the farther one dissipates as well as the nearer one is this potentially because of the inverse square law edit this question probably applies in similar way to light not quite sure what the right tags should be for this
87560 if have dynamo connected to switch and load such as light bulb the load on the dynamo is increased when the switch is closed and the light comes on the dynamo gets harder to turn is the same true for radio transmitter and receiver if the receiving aerial is initially not connected to circuit and then is connected can you detect at the transmitting end that the load was added at the receiving end if not what is the difference between the two examples
87731 dont know if anyone else has noticed this but in most buildings and most rooms radiators are predominantly placed under window now in my eyes that is the worst place to put them hot air rises reaches the window which no matter how well insulated its still letting out heat in loose terms and the thermal energy of the air disperses around the window area thus not doing much to warm up the room am wrong to think this mean can hold my hand close to my window and feel that it is colder there than at the other end of my room but then again my room does warm up when the radiator is on
87751 it is common belief that low frequencies travel longer distances indeed the bass is really what you hear when the neighbor plays his hifi loud woom woom try asking people around lot of them believe that low sounds carry longer distances but my experience isnt as straightforward in particular when stand near someone whos listening loud music in headphones it is the high pitched sounds that hear tchts tchts not the bass when sit next to an unamplified turntable the disc is spinning but the volume is turned off hear high pitched sounds tchts tchts not the bass so with very weak sounds high frequencies seem to travel further this makes me think that perhaps low frequencies do not carry longer distances but the very high amplitude of the bass in my neighbors speakers compensates for that perhaps also the low frequencies resonate with the walls of the building probably also the medium the sound travels through makes difference or perhaps high frequencies are reflected more by walls than low frequencies found this rather cute high school experiment online which seems to conclude that low and high frequencies travel as far but arent there laws that physicist wrote centuries ago about this
87796 now ive seen lot of answers to this sort of question but most of them provide answers that dont actually make sense from physics perspective as an example of such an answer ive commonly seen it mentioned that stun guns avoid killing people because they use transformers to step up the voltage and reduce the current of course because transformers reflect impedance the current flowing between the electrodes when the human body completes the circuit will just obey ohms law with the stepped up voltage now even with the more modest stun gun claims of say mathrm kv and generous estimate of the resistance of the human body mathrm omega that would mean current of mathrm more than enough to kill or cause serious damage as see it there are only few possible explanations manufacturers are lying and the voltages generated by stun guns between the electrodes are much lower than reported the pulses are just too short in duration to cause serious damage the placement of the electrodes no more than an inches apart means that the path taken by the current never goes much below the skin and definitely doesnt wind through vital organs based solely on my intuition would think is the most likely explanation with healthy dose of as well since some of the claimed voltages are obviously far too high but im not too sure thats the case any insight on which if any of these is the correct explanation edit the responses got me wondering what would be the limiting factor if the typical designs did not use capacitor which led me to another fundamental limiting factor which think is what was behind the point that drawing such power from small device could not be sustained to step up the voltage from mathrm battery the typical sort used in stun guns to mathrm kv would require stepping voltage up by factor of approximately times since the current in the secondary would also have to be reduced by that factor for the current to be mathrm in the secondary it would have to be mathrm ka in the primary drawing that sort of current from mathrm battery is just not possible as the internal resistance of the battery is too high not to mention that even if you could draw that sort of current from mathrm battery the battery would probably be instantly depleted or components would melt or explode typical mathrm batteries have internal resistances around mathrm omega http ww2 duracell com media en us pdf gtcl product data sheet na datasheets mn1604 6lr61 us ct pdf for example so drawing current that high is out of the question incidentally if my thinking on this point is correct that also explains why most stun guns step up the voltage bit charge one capacitor of higher voltage than the battery and use that discharge to charge an even higher voltage capacitor the batteries simply cant generate enough current to be stepped up that far without such multi tier approach does my reasoning on this point seem correct again thanks for your patience and help
87817 it is standard exercise in relativistic electrodynamics to show that the electromagnetic field tensor mu nu whose components equal the electric cf i0 and magnetic frac12 epsilon ijk jk fields in the taken frame of reference has two lorentz invariant quantities frac12f mu nu mu nu mathbf mathbf and frac14f mu nu ast mu nu frac14 epsilon mu nu alpha beta mu nu alpha beta mathbf cdot mathbf there is however further wikipedia article which states that these two quantities are fundamental in the sense that any other invariant of this tensor must be function of these two while find this plausible have never seen proof of this fact and it is absent from jackson is there simple proof of this fact im particularly interested in higher order invariants but would also like answers to include proof that these are the only two bilinears to be more precise would like to see proof that any function mu nu mapsto if in mathbb that takes electromagnetic field tensors to real scalars and which is lorentz invariant lambda mu alpha lambda nu beta alpha beta if mu nu for all lorentz transformations must be function if if mu nu mu nu mu nu ast mu nu of the two fundamental invariants described above if there are multiple ways to arrive at this result would also appreciate comments on how they relate to each other

88145 im curious why rockets are so big in their size since both the gravitational potential one need to overcome in order to put thing into orbit and the chemical energy burned from the fuel are proportional to the mass so if we shrink the rocket size it would seem to be fine to launch satellites so why not build small rocket say the size of human can imagine small rocket would be easier to manufacture in large quantities and easier to transport and maybe someone can make business out of small rocket carrying ones own satellite

88504 im porting maxwells equations to curved spacetime and am having trouble reconciling the tensor and forms treatments think the problem boils down to misunderstanding on my part concerning the exterior covariant derivative rather than just the exterior derivative but thats only guess so in minkowski spacetime we have mu nu nu mu mu nu text mu nu kappa and text text text the equivalence of which is easy to show however suppose were working in curved spacetime we get mu nu nu mu mu nu text mu nu kappa however the connection coefficients in the covariant derivatives neatly cancel out so both tensor expressions are equivalent to each other however suppose we attempt to bring the flat space forms expression into curved spacetime by turning the exterior derivative into an exterior covariant derivative we start with text da and then naively find text df text text omega wedge neq where omega is the curvature form so suddenly the tensor and forms methods seem to give differing versions of maxwells laws is one not obligated to employ the covariant exterior derivative in this situation maybe am seriously missing something but it seems like the exterior covariant derivative gets much less mention than it should in relativity if it is required to deploy forms at all on curved manifolds the hodge star of course contains information about the metric but it seems here like we arrive at an inconsistency before needing to invoke it to find the other two maxwells equations thanks for any insight

88826 an hourglass weighs when its placed on scale with all the sand rested in the lower portion the scale reads weight where now if you turn the hourglass upside down to let the sand start to flow down what does the scale read imagine initially when the sand starts to fall but before the first batch of grains touch the bottom of the hourglass these grains of sand effectively are in state of free fall so their weight would not register onto the scale the weight at this point has to be less than however what about the steady state when there is always some sand falling and some sand hitting the bottom of the hourglass in the steady state although we are having some sands in the free fall state and thus decrease the weight of there are also sands that are hitting decelerating the bottom of the hourglass this deceleration should translate increase the reading on the scale more than the actual weight of those impacting sands to illustrate the last point imagine ball weighing 500g rested on scale if you drop this ball from mile high onto the same scale on impact the scale would read higher than 500g in the same way in our hourglass question will the decreasing effect of weight due to free fall cancel out exactly the increasing effect of weight due to sand impacting does it depend on the diameter of the opening does it depend on the height of the free fall does it depend on the air pressure inside the hourglass

89002 am new to qft so may have some of the terminology incorrect many qft books provide an example of deriving equations of motion for various free theories one example is for complex scalar field mathcal text compl scaclar partial mu phi partial mu phi phi phi the usual trick to obtaining the equations of motion is to treat phi and phi as separate fields even after this trick authors choose to treat them as separate fields in their terminology this is done sometimes before imposing second quantization on the commutation relations so that phi is not yet field of operators in particular am following the formulation of qft in this book by robert klauber student friendly quantum field theory what is the motivation for this method of treating the two fields as separate intuitively want to treat phi as simply the complex conjugate of phi not as separate field and work exclusively with phi is it simply shortcut to obtaining the equations of motion square phi square phi also understand that one could write phi phi phi where the two subscripted fields are real as is done here perhaps this addresses my question in way that dont understand
89035 ive just finished classical mechanics course and looking back on it some things are not quite clear in the first half we covered the lagrangian formalism which thought was pretty cool specially appreciated the freedom you have when choosing coordinates and the fact that you can basically ignore constraint forces of course most simple situations you can solve using good old ma but for more complicated stuff the whole formalism comes in pretty handy then in the second half we switched to hamiltonian mechanics and thats where began to lose sight of why we were doing things the way we were dont have any problem understanding the hamiltonian or hamiltons equations or the hamilton jacobi equation or what have you my issue is that dont understand why would someone bother developing all this to do the same things you did before but in different way in fact in most cases you need to start with lagrangian and get the momenta from frac partial partial dot and the hamiltonian from sum dot but if you already have the lagrangian why not just solve the euler lagrange equations guess maybe there are interesting uses of the hamiltion formalism and we just didnt do whole lot of examples it was the harmonic oscillator the whole way pretty much ive also heard that it allows somewhat smooth transition into quantum mechanics we did work out way to get schr dingers equation doing stuff with the action but still somethings not clicking my questions are the following why do people use the hamiltonian formalism is it better for theoretical work are there problems that are more easily solved using hamiltons mechanics instead of lagranges what are some examples of that

89075 most textbooks say that given countable basis phi rangle of hilbert space that every vector psi rangle of the space can be written as psi rangle sum infty phi rangle but this an infinite linear combination and every vector should be expressed by finite linear combination so think that they are an orthogonal set which generates the vector space as an infinite linear combination the difference between infinite and finite lc means that orthonormal sets are usually smaller than basis but for the rest of the properties phi rangle looks like basis to me so is phi rangle basis or just an orthogonal set

89173 have question about the tensor decomposition of mathrm su3 according to georgi page and tensor decomposes as begin equation mathbf otimes mathbf bar mathbf oplus mathbf end equation where the mathbf represents the trace however do not understand why we cannot further decompose the traceless part into symmetric and an antisymmetric part in order to understand my logic general tensor varphi transforms as begin equation varphi rightarrow varphi end equation whereas varphi transforms as begin equation varphi rightarrow varphi end equation where in mathrm su3 is times matrix now will let denote the traceless part of has dimensions mathbf and we can decompose this in the symmetric and antisymmetric part as usual begin equation frac frac end equation then under an mathrm su3 transformation begin equation rightarrow end equation and begin equation rightarrow end equation therefore the symmetric part keeps its symmetry and the antisymmetric part keeps its antisymmetry thus two invariant subspaces are created and the representation is reducible to sum up would think we decompose as begin equation mathbf otimes mathbf bar mathbf oplus mathbf oplus mathbf end equation where mathbf denotes the dimensions of the antisymmetric part and mathbf denotes the dimensions of the symmetric part where am going wrong edit got my convention from invariances in physics and group theory by jean bernard zuber

89518 the question you are asking appears to be subjective and is likely to be closed challenge accepted okay here it is friend prone to uplifting aphorisms posted on facebook you are an infinite possibility thought about that and it seems to me that given the bekenstein bound one can calculate the maximal number of possible states in principle of the human brain given an average volume lo and behold wikipedia revealed that someones actually done the calculation and gives the number as less than approximately times states on the other hand if you model the brain as quantum system and calculate its evolution over time with the schr dinger equation well the wavefunction is continuous so doesnt it in principle describe an infinite number of possible states
89570 whenever there are high winds such as in storms thin metal roofs on sheds as well as concave roofs on huts are sometimes blown away one explanation provided to me said that the higher velocity of the air outside causes the air pressure above the roof to decrease and when it has decreased to certain extent such that the air pressure above the roof is lesser than the air pressure beneath the roof and due to some kind of osmosis the air particles move from the area of higher pressure beneath the roof to the area of low pressure in this process the roof is blown away another explanation specifically about the thin metal roofs said that it was blown away due to the lift caused by the air and this is the same kind of lift you get when you blow on paper both these explanations puzzle me what really bothers me is the basis of the first one how can an increase in velocity cause pressure to drop cant seem to correlate that with the force per unit area definition of pressure please oh great physicists of the internet help me and every other ordinary person to understand how and why roofs get blown away
89618 the soft photon theorem is the following statement due to weinberg consider an amplitude cal involving some incoming and some outgoing particles now consider the same amplitude with an additional soft photon omega text photon to coupled to one of the particles call this amplitude cal the two amplitudes are related by cal cal frac eta cdot epsilon cdot gamma eta varepsilon where is the momentum of the particle that the photon couples to epsilon is the polarization of the photon and gamma is the momentum of the soft photon eta for outgoing particles and eta for incoming ones finally is the charge of the particle the most striking thing about this theorem to me is the fact that the proportionality factor relating cal and cal is independent of the type of particle that the photon couples to it seems quite amazing to me that even though the coupling of photons to scalars spinors etc takes such different form you still end up getting the same coupling above while can show that this is indeed true for all the special cases of interest my question is is there general proof or understanding that describes this universal coupling of soft photons
89659 the hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom frac mathbf 2m frac is spherically symmetric and it therefore commutes with the angular momentum mathbf this causes all its eigenfunctions with equal angular momentum number but arbitrary magnetic quantum number to be degenerate in energy the hydrogen atom also has further degeneracy in that given any angular momentum there are usually other with the same energy this degeneracy is due to the existence of second constant of motion usually called the laplace runge lenz vector mathbf frac 2m mathbf times mathbf mathbf times mathbf frac mathbf which is the generator of an even bigger symmetry which is isomorphic for bound states to the group rm so of rotations in four dimensions of the kepler problem the runge lenz vector also has rich geometrical interpretation for classical elliptical orbit it points from the focus to the periapsis and its magnitude is proportional to the orbits eccentricity for circular orbits it vanishes image source wikipedia the hydrogen atom is usually described in the common eigenbasis of the hamiltonian and the angular momentum with the well known and well loved quantum numbers nlm rangle however the runge lenz vector mathbf is also constant of the motion what do its eigenfunctions look like more concretely im looking for the spatial structure of the common eigenfunctions of and at least one component of mathbf and possibly also of which in analogy with the common eigenfunctions of and is the most one could expect and if thats not possible then an explanation of why and description of suitable third quantum numbers to complete csco would like to know what their corresponding eigenvalues are and what the uncertainty of the other components is whether one can assign classical eccentricity to the orbital and more generally in the relation to the corresponding classical geometry
89690 yeah havent quite understood or been told what happens to for example an electron and its wavefunction when you stop to measure it mean an electron has wave function describing its position and so on in the region of space it is confined when measure it get an output and the wavefunction collapses as far as understand but then when stop measuring the electron has not been destroyed has it so does it resume its original wavefunction and continue as nothing has happened or have totally misunderstood something

90242 its pretty straight forward to visualise second order non linear optical mixing processes in which two waves of frequencies omega and omega mix up to generate new waves of different frequencies for example the sum frequency generation or the difference frequency generation but my question is what new waves could the two omega and omega waves generate by third order non linear optical mixing processes would it be possible to have two wave input and two wave output for example omega and omega input omega omega and omega omega output the only examples of third order processes that found on my references involve an input of three waves as in

90418 from wikipedia read that the formula for calculating the time dilation caused by mass is sqrt frac 2gm rc where is the proper time between events and for slow ticking observer within the gravitational field is the coordinate time between events and for fast ticking observer at an arbitrarily large distance from the massive object is the gravitational constant is the mass of the object creating the gravitational field is the radial coordinate of the observer which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object but is actually schwarzschild coordinate is the speed of light the question is what if frac 2gm rc is greater than this can happen if the mass is too big or if the radius is too small
90533 what causes time dilation acceleration or velocity ive seen multiple comments on this forum that assert velocity is the cause but that doesnt seem right to me you cant have velocity without acceleration its the inertial force with acceleration that breaks the symmetry my understanding is that the asymmetry is where the inertial frame changes measuring time between two objects with different inertial frames is where you have time dilation when the acceleration ends the object is effectively at rest in new inertial frame and has velocity relative to another object in the original inertial frame in other words acceleration changing reference frames is the cause velocity and time dilation is the effect am right about this if there are flaws in my logic id like to find and correct them
90556 the question have in mind is if we place conductor arbitrary shape of total charge zero in uniform external electric field textbf does it experience any net force why not now will discuss the context of the question am working on griffiths introduction to electrodynamics fourth edition problem not homework problem though it says prove or disprove with counterexample the following theorem suppose conductor carrying net charge when placed in an external electric field textbf experiences force textbf if the external field is now reversed textbf to textbf the force also reverses textbf to textbf what if we stipulate that the external field is uniform in general this is obviously not true will first limit myself to the case of one approach when textbf is reversed the surface charged distribution sigma is also reversed to cancel textbf so the electrostatic pressure at every point frac epsilon sigma hat textbf stays the same consequently textbf stays the same rather than flips sign another approach there is an intuitive counterexample conductor is generally attracted to point charge nearby if the sign of the point charge is flipped the conductor is still attracted rather than repulsed so the first question is easy and the interesting one is what if we stipulate that the external field is uniform suspect that in uniform external field the net force is zero so that textbf textbf but cant think of way to prove or disprove it
90592 ive seen many science popularisation documentaries and read few books obviously not being scientist myself am able to process and understand basic ideas behind most of these however for general relativity there is this one illustration which is being used over and over image from wikipedia always thought that general relativity gives another way how you can describe gravity however for this illustration to work there needs to be another force pulling the object down referring to direction in the attached image if put two non moving objects in the image what force will pull them together so where is my understanding incorrect or is general relativity not about explaining gravity and just describes how heavy objects bends spacetime in that case the analogy is being used not correctly in my opinion update thank you for the answers and comments namely the xkcd comics is spot on understand that the analogy with bent sheet of fabric pretty bad but it seems that it can be fixed if you dont bent the fabric but just distort the drawn grid would you be so kind and answer the second part of the question as well whether general relativity is explaining gravitational force to me it seems that it is not bending of spacetime simply can not affect two non moving objects however most of the time it is being presented that it does

90804 have this question going in my mind from many days why brightness of light emitted from any light source around us decreases with distance the brightness of light from tube light streetlight etc or any light from any source around us decreases with the distance as my teacher has taught me that light is form of radiation thought this decrease in brightness may be due to absorption of radiation in the medium dont know whether it is correct or wrong if it is wrong please explain why there will be decrease in brightness of light with increase in distance from the light source if we assume that decrease in brightness of light is due to absorption of radiation in the medium then in vaccum where we can assume no energy dissipation would there be no decrease in brightness of light with respect to distance from the light source
90830 understand that for resistors in series we need to add for each resistor to get the equivalent resistance where is resistance also understand the mathematical manipulations that show that for resistors in parallel we need to add the for each resistor to get the equivalent resistance however have couple of questions that have to do with the physical interpretation of the mathematical manipulations involved first am trying to understand why in the case of parallel resistors we have to add rs instead of adding rs as in the case of resistors in series could it be thought that the current in the wire is like sort of water flow in the pipe that has two horizontal parallel pipes positioned one on top of the other and in between connected by number of vertical pipes that have tap each that could be adjusted to represent different resistances then at the top of each vertical pipe the water pressure exists and at the bottom the pressure will be reduced by for example suppose we have three vertical pipes so then the pressure at the bottom of each after the tap is for the total of so why is the equivalent resistance not but r1 r2 r3 and how can be able to visualize this relation
90903 am looking at wikipedias article on deriving the schwarzschild solution in the section simplifying the components it says on the hypersurfaces of constant and constant it is required that the metric be that of sphere dl 2d theta sin theta phi my question is why does the metric have to be this particular sphere with coefficient of we are not necessarily dealing with euclidean space here
90979 we all know that gravitation force between two small not heavenly bodies is negligible we give reason that their mass is very small but according to inverse square law as to then to infty but in real life we observe that even if we bring two objects very close no such force is seen why is this so
91158 have this bowl roughly the shape of circular truncated cone and the lamp shines on the bowl at an angle the reflected lamp light hit the bottom of the bowl and created light ring that looks just like cardioid could someone help me or give me hint on how to really solve the equation for the light ring
91192 read that it makes difference whether you calculate frac de lambda lambda or frac de omega omega in the sense that the maximum energy density with respect to the wavelength does not coincide with the frequency maximum that one would assume to be at omega max frac lambda max actually do not understand why this is so now am only interested in pure physical explanation mathematically this is clear and due to the chain rule does anybody know how to explain this odd thing somehow feel that the core of the question has not been completely answered although can easily look up wikipedia where the need for the chain rule is explained am rather interested in understanding where the following argument breaks down which seems to be why this question has caused some confusion in the pastas you can see by googling this question so we have omega the energy radiated at given frequency now this function has maximum somewhere so there is frequency where maximal amount of energy is emitted in other words if you add the sum of the photons energies at each frequency that are emitted you will notice that the maximum is reached at this frquency now lambda tells you basically the same for the wavelength but again we know where at which frequency the maximal amount of energy is radiated so we know the corresponding wavelength think there is need to explain this if anything is unclear please let me know
91243 have bottle of vodka that has load of gold flakes suspended in it it has been sat still for over hours and the flakes are all still suspended within the liquid they have not risen to the surface or sunk to the bottom any ideas as to the physics behind this
91302 we know psixt is complex but can psix be complex have seen particle in box well and harmonic oscillator all have real solutions for time independent schr dinger equation hence am curious to know examples where it is complex this question says that it is possible hence my request is for examples and references
91316 imagine the sliding part of the mirror is controlled by computer and opens on intervals is it possible to increase the power of the beam by making it bounce between the mirrors thus going through the lens and then releasing it resulting in beam with more power
91331 in the particle in box harmonic oscillator and in hydrogen atom we can safely assume psixt psixe omega so why not make it postulate to consider the wave function to be always in the form psixe omega we can still explain all the foundational experiments so my question is why not make this amendment to the theory so that we can avoid lot of nightmares and some peace of mind why unnecessarily consider so general thing when we can do away with simple things most of the time oh my actual question is where do we run into problems practical physical situations experiments if we consider such thing if we run into problem anywhere hope to make any other simple changes to fix them but without going back on this one
91378 im wondering of the dirac lagrangian density mathcal overline psi gamma mu partial mu psi is an hermitian operator since upon complex conjugating one gets mathcal dagger psi daggeri gamma gamma mu gamma partial mu gamma psi overline psi gamma mu overleftarrow partial mu psi neq mathcal and should lagrangian always be hermitian know that hermitian operator has real eigenvalues which is desirable for operator describing observables but here the lagrangian isnt really an observable since it is determined modulo an total derivative ive found related question on the site were it is said that the derivative partial mu in the dirac lagrangian is antihermitian is the lagrangian density in field theory real can someone show me how to demonstrate this
91501 understand the energy and mass can change back and forth according to einstein it is fluid it can go from one to the other so what keeps mass from just turning into energy is there some force holding subatomic particle together what keeps mass in its state hope this is not silly question but am clueless thanks
91507 is there any optical component in existence that uniformizes randomly pointing rays
91685 it is known fact that boiling point of water decreases by decreasing of pressure so there is pressure at which water boils at room temperature would it be possible to cook pasta at room temperature in vacuum chamber with low enough pressure or magic of cooking pasta is not in boiling and we would be able to cook pasta at without boiling water at high pressure
91881 so this question arose when was pondering the meaning of horsepower and torque in cars thought of the following question there is kilogram weight on planet planet has no atmosphere and has gravitational constant of meter per second per second the weight is raised to height of meters and dropped the weight will fall through the first meter in second and the second meter in seconds rounding bit so in terms of work gravity does joule of work on the weight over each meter interval however in terms of power gravity exerts watt of power over the first interval and watts over the second interval why does it seem that gravity is magically more powerful when the object is travelling faster the same question applies to rocket ship in space assuming infinite fuel the rocket will exert constant force no matter the speed and burn fuel at the same rate but from constant reference frame from where the rocket launched it will appear that the faster the rocket travels the more energy it expends per second think these questions accurately portray the confusion ive had with the concept of power ever since physics in college so many years ago thanks for reading
91895 why is proton assumed to be always at the center while applying the schr dinger equation isnt it quantum particle
92030 why dont we use beta radiation to make our electricity since it is an electron being released made it would make sense to try and capture it but we obviously dont so what am missing in my logic
92037 lawrence krauss said this on an australian programme when you apply quantum mechanics to gravity space itself can arise from nothing as can time can you elaborate on this please its hard to search for
92050 do gravitational lenses have focus point could burn space ants
92051 in inelastic collisions kinetic energy changes so the velocities of the objects also change so how is momentum conserved in inelastic collisions
92109 space like separated events are events that in well chosen reference frame can take place at the same time but never happen at the same location on the other hand for time like events one can chose reference frame such that they happen at the same place but never simultaneously cant help thinking that the labels are therefore very ill chosen is there another motivation for these names
92244 could you give me an idea of what bound states mean and what is their importance in quantum mechanics problems with potential potential described by delta function why when stable bound state exists the energies of the related stationary wavefunctions are negative figured it out mathematically for instance in the case of potential described by delta function but what is the physical meaning
92274 as is usually said measurement of an observable leads to collapse of wavefunction to an eigenstate of the corresponding operator hat that is now the wavefunction in representation is psiq deltaq where is result of measurement now in reality measurements are never exact so the wavefunction should not have that sharp peak instead it should be broadened depending on precision of measurement in this case can we still introduce an operator an eigenstate of which would the new wavefunction appear is it useful in any way or does the new wavefunction depend too much on the way it was measured so that each instrument would have its own operator how would such opeartor look for single slit experiment
92284 do not know much about tensors so wonder is it possible to explain general relativity without tensors have some understanding of special relativity also have some understanding about differential equations and matrices
92465 the sun pulls on the moon with force that is more than twice the magnitude of the force with which the earth attracts the moon why then doesn the sun take the moon away from the earth
92516 im just going to go ahead and steal this question question directly of reddit since have more trust in the answers get on this site so if the moon was twice as big but also twice as far way would there be any difference in the effects that the moon now has on earth like tides and such also would there be any difference in the moons orbital motion apart from the fact that the time it takes for the moon to rotate around earth would be longer what will increase is the mass and diameterby factor of of the moon the density of the moon will stay the same
92535 is black color or absence of color when there is no light everything is black so how can we say that black is color
92715 why do the electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular motion not like the earth which revolves around the sun in an eliptical motion
92719 this question is motivated by several myths have heard recently want to know if there is problem with using compass inside submarine can see two different issues so im wondering if anyone can clarify if you do some googling on this issue you will see all answers from yes to no most of which include very suspicious physics does the submarine somehow shield the magnetic field of the earth well it seems obvious that submarine is not faraday cage but it is giant hunk of metal so there could in principle be an issue guess they are generally made of something like steel so it would magnetize weakly but the magnetization should match the field of the earth so the compass should still read true right electrical activity in the submarine can produce magnetic fields larger than the earth this is likely true on this site you can see that non nuclear submarines used batteries capabible of producing currents around of course this site called that the power of the battery so maybe its not good reference anyway current of would match the field of the earth assuming at distance frac mu pi rightarrow sim in any case this seems like pretty reasonable argument maybe it does not apply to the nuclear case however anyone have any ideas comment is there tag for this kind of question something about using basic physics to mythbust
92758 my friend and were arguing about this and was wondering if someone out there could settle this for us basically he and were walking to buy some stamps when we were on our return trip he made the assertion that when returned to my desk which is where our trip began would have accomplished zero net work that is utilizing our admittedly simple understanding of work from wikipedia in physics force is said to do work when it acts on body and there is displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force when return to my departure point that is my desk the total displacement would be zero and using the definition from wikipedia that fd and is displacement no work was done intuitively suggested that there were two quantities of work done one quantity of work from my desk to the shop and one quantity of work from the shop to my desk but when look at some decriptions of displacement vector feel like the two displacements may also cancel each other out can someone help us sort this out thanks in advance for the help
92825 im writing script involving physics equations and someone complained that my script outputs as as well as outputting as another example would be vs ive obviously opted for displaying the variables in the equations in alphabetical order and it looks wrong because its against convention but why are the variables ordered in the way they conventionally are in the first place from what can see of all the examples ive just given the out of place variable is mass so perhaps the convention is to put mass first dont see any reason why that would be the case though
92933 am reading online tutorial about lagrangian mechanics in one section it states that if the kinetic term in lagrangian has no explicit time dependence the hamiltonian does not explicitly depends on time so just wonder if it is always true that why require it has no explicit time dependence
92969 could understand that the definition of second wouldnt have an uncertainty when related to the transition of the cs atom so it doesnt have an error because its an absolute reference and we measure other stuff using the physical definition of second like atomic clocks do but why doesnt the speed of light have uncertainty isnt the speed of light something thats measured physically check out that at nist
93059 my professor gave us the following reason the screen is positively charged when dust particles fly near it the positive charges in the screen induce charge in the dust particle pulling the negative charges closer to it and pushing the positive charges away the screen then attracts the negative side pulling the dust particle to it but why does the screen attract the whole dust particle its only attracting the negative charges so why does the whole dust particle go to the screen why doesnt the screen just rip out the electrons and repel away the rest of the particle
93183 trying to go through the page on topological quantum field theory the original atiyah segal axioms let lambda be commutative ring with atiyah originally proposed the axioms of topological quantum field theory tqft in dimension defined over ground ring lambda as following finitely generated lambda module sigma associated to each oriented closed smooth dimensional manifold sigma corresponding to the homotopy axiom an element zm in partial associated to each oriented smooth dimensional manifold with boundary corresponding to an additive axiom pardon my question is really stupid if not just naive questions bullet how do see this axiom zm in partial is correct instead of zm ni partial it seems is one higher dimension than its boundary partial so why not more intuitively zm ni partial or is that misleading typo in wiki instead we have sigma in partial with being one higher dimensional than sigma sigma bullet ii how do physically intuitively digest as homotopy axiom and as an additive axiom ps suppose we shall view sigma as tqft partition function on the manifold sigma
93567 am physics enthusiast and have question why is it meaningless to express the pm standard deviation value as percentage
93588 think of coulombs constant as conversion factor not sure if this is correct kind of like how you would do calculations in kg and then times it by the conversion constant to convert your answer to pounds the conversion factor would be mathrm lbs kg since the units for coulombs constant is mathrm cdot would it make sense to define the newton as text newton frac mathrm meter cdot mathrm coulomb would the above definition be valid edit so if is not conversion factor since the above definition for newton is invalid and is not just scaling factor since it has units then what is it if its just proportionality constant to adjust the magnitude then why does it have units shouldnt it be unit less constant edit so is not just scaling factor since it has units and its not conversion factor since newton cant be expressed as the other units so if its unit just exists so that things cancel out nicely doesnt this make dimensional analysis useless since you can add in random constants and units to cancel out whatever you want my question is not about the meaning of its about its units
93599 in order for body to move with uniform velocity in circular path there must exist some force towards the centre of curvature of the circular path this is centripetal force by newtons third law there must exist reactive force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction this is the reactive centrifugal force my question is simple and it is probably the result of lack of common sense but here it goes in uniform circular motion why dont these forces simply cancel each other out if they did how would we know they exist in that situation when swing rock tied to rope feel the centrifugal force but not the centripetal force in this situation how can the reactive force be greater than the force itself
93634 there are no stable mesons as far as know are there any meson colliders analogous to for example proton proton colliders edit this edit was made more than year after the original question was posed want to add here that there are interesting experiment involving shooting mesons on other stuff for instance to investigate the properties of the hypernucleon lambda7 text li collaboration led by kiyoshi tanida of tokyo university bombarded lithium target with pions but as noted in the answers and comments in colliders you usually want to smash everything to pieces and hence why use an unstable meson when you can use stable proton
93671 read that as the air density is lower at high altitudes the scattering is less hence the darker blue but then other colors are scattering lesser than blue why dont we see darker shade of the other colors
93698 ive heard it from two teachers and saw task with solution based on this assumption if the net torque is zero when measured from one frame of reference it is equal to zero in all other frames of reference this actually seems clear especially if you put it to simple words like if body doesnt rotate from one point of view it wont start rotating if you look at it from another point of view still wanted to test it and made such an image calculated the net torque measured from point ill skip the designations such as etc and get to the value 1m cdot1n 5m cdot1n 4m cdot1 5n now lets calculate the net torque from 2m cdot1n 2m cdot1n 1m cdot1 5n 5nm from this it seems that the body doesnt rotate around an axis in but does around the axis in
93703 dont understand how quantum mechanics and therefore also quantum computers can work given that while we work with quantum states particles that this quantum state consist of cannot be observed which is the most fundamental requirement if am not mistaken by observed we mean interaction with any other particle photon gluon electron or whatever else so my very important questions arent the particles this quantum state consists of interacting with each other why doesnt that cause the state to collapse arent all particles in the universe interacting with higgs field and gravitons etc why doesnt that cause every quantum state to collapse feel there is something very fundamental in quantum mechanics that am not aware of hence would be very pleased to have these questions answered
93938 have two questions regarding protons wikipedia says mean lifetime of proton years stable obviously this means practically nothing happens to proton but what does this mean lifetime signify what does the proton decompose into or what particles is it emitting which will ultimately make it non existant since proton is made up of quarks which though do not individually exist do exist together and have charge is it possible that under extremely high power electric fields even proton or electron or neutrons may also get induced charge down quarks move to one side and up quarks to one do in their native states they exist as kind of an electrical tripole
94103 there have already been lot of questions on this site on diffraction but still believe this one might be slightly different in electromagnetic waves diffraction and any other phenomenon of wave propagation can be solved by huygens principle geometric construction that asks us to consider all points on wavefront as secondary sources of wavefront justification of this treatment is provided by feynman understood this completely but then diffraction is very general phenomenon what if we talk about mechanical waves sound waves then this treatment by superposing the fields produced by opaque and hypothetical plug is no longer valid but the diffraction details are similar why then on an intuitive level is there diffraction details of which can be worked out by considering secondary sources
94153 charge is carried by electrons moving the protons are always stationary the answer found online is the protons are stuck in the nucleus so they cant move strong nuclear force but why cant the whole positively charged atom move
94181 ive been looking at the planck cosmological parameters paper trying to update my toy cosmology simulator with the most recent data most of the interesting values such as omega and omega lambda can be found in table on page but the one thing didnt find was an estimate of the energy density of radiation can this be derived from some other parameters in these data
94183 suppose that am inside of moving train have coin in my hand and am standing still if toss this coin straight up it will fall back into my hand now suppose that am on that moving trains roof now if toss the coin straight up the coin will not land in my hand rather it will fall toward the place where the train was when tossed it why is there difference
94235 was laying on my bed reading book when the sun shone through the windows on my left happened to look at the wall on my right and noticed this very strange effect the shadow of my elbow when near the pages of the book joined up with the shadow of the book even though wasnt physically touching it have posted video of the event the video seems to be the wrong way up but you still get the idea of what is happening what is causing this some sort of optical illusion where the light gets bent coincidentally have been wondering about similar effect recently where if you focus your eye on nearby object say your finger objects behind it in the distance seem to get curved distorted around the edge of your finger it seems awfully related edit could see the bulge with my bare eyes to the same extent as in the video the room was well light and the wall was indeed quite bright
94253 in quantum field theory the elements of the matrix are defined as the amplitude describing the transition from an initial particle state the in state to an final particle state begin equation fi langle mathbf dots mathbf text out mathbf dots mathbf text in rangle tag end equation to me it seems that this equation only makes sense if the amount of in particles is equal to the amount of out particles otherwise we can not take the inner product for instance if and then we can write equation as begin equation begin pmatrix mathbf mathbf end pmatrix begin pmatrix mathbf mathbf mathbf end pmatrix end equation which is undefined therefore my question is how to interpret equation if neq must admit that have never studied the matrix in quantum mechanics therefore apologize in advance if this is naive question
94356 when sit in my garden during the day always keep looking at the two intersecting shadows of two rods it looks something like this what find weird about it is that at the point of intersection of the shadows instead of becoming darker they become bright can anybody explain why this happens
94375 is it possible to answer my question definitely assuming the monitor is perfect what would be the formula for calculating rgb values for visible monochrome light with given wavelength
94416 in many experiments in quantum mechanics single photon is sent to mirror which it passes through or bounces off with probability then the same for some more similar mirrors and at the end we get interference between the various paths this is fairly easy to observe in the laboratory the interference means there is no which path information stored anywhere in the mirrors the mirrors are made of something atoms they arent necessarily ultra pure crystals and theyre at room temperature nonetheless they act on the photons as very simple unitary operators why is it that the mirrors retain no or very little trace of the photons path so that very little decoherence occurs in general how do look at physical situation and predict when there will be enough noisy interaction with the environment for quantum state to decohere
94471 today friends six year old sister asked me the question why dont people on the other side of the earth fall off tried to explain that the earth is huge sphere and theres special force called gravity that tries to attract everything to the center of the earth but she doesnt seem to understand it also made some attempts using globe saying that up and down are all local perspective and people on the other side of the earth feel theyre on the top but she still doesnt get it how can explain the concept of gravity to six year old in simple and meaningful way
94538 ive always learned that mixture of ice and water should reach equilibrium at approximately 0c ive actually tried to create that number of times in different contexts and always fail first an ice bath in plastic container get 3c occasionally as low as 2c with multimeter thermocouple granted those are inaccurate so ive tried digital thermometer from vernier with claimed accuracy of 5c confirmed with an ir thermometer same story thinking that perhaps it is due to warming from the outside have put the ice bath in thermos and chilled it while same story am not using distilled water so there are some minerals in the water but if anything thought that would lower the temperature of the ice bath
94560 it seems there are lot of respected physicists appearing on pop sci programs discovery channel science channel etc these days spreading the gospel of we can know we must know three examples quickly many programs feature michio kaku saying that he is on quest to find an equation perhaps just one inch long which will describe the whole universe max tegmark has come out with new book in which he expresses the gut feeling that nothing is off limits to science the subtitle of this book is my quest for the ultimate nature of reality in the series through the wormhole there is talk about search for the god equation good counter example would be feynman but his self described non axiomatic or babylonian approach does not seem popular with physicists today is there any sense among physicists that it might be impossible to articulate the ultimate nature of reality in equations and formal logic it seems to me that physicists are following in the footsteps of the 19th century mathematicians led by hilbert who were on similar quest which was put to rest by dels incompleteness theorems in is there any appreciation for how the incompleteness theorems might apply to physics has any progress been made on hilberts 6th problem for the 20th century shouldnt this be addressed before getting all worked up about god equation
94573 had recent conversation with my girlfriend who is physics grad student she was kind enough to listen to me rant about an idea concerning escape velocity unfortunately am still thinking about this question but dont want to bother her with it my thought is that we shouldnt actually need to reach 11km sec to leave the earths gravity instead of this can we simply apply enough force to overcome earths gravity without reaching that speed how we would do this is not part of my question orbital altitude is miles travelling mph straight up should get you there in hours granted you have enough force to push know some of the simpler math like ma but that didnt help me understand browsed some articles about space elevators and couldnt find my answer then thought about regular elevator and the fact that it has enough force to move it away from the earth successfully even if the elevator moved at nanometer sec it would still move away from the earth overcoming the minute pull of gravity at that altitude if you missed it my question was can we simply apply enough force to overcome earths gravity without reaching that speed edit in another example lets say we could drive car from here to low earth orbit as long as we had enough torque we should be able to overcome gravity much like pickup truck pulling bunch of lumber is that correct
94635 lets assume an averaged sized man meters height kg whos sky diving from height lets also assume hes using tight clothes and no parachute the idea is is it possible for him to survive the fall if he tries to get the maximum velocity he can get by free falling and later by positioning his body horizontally in way that resembles wing shape get enough upwards impulsion so he can land safely edit was not looking for surviving stories that happened by chance was looking for the possibility of technique that would allow someone trained to land safely multiple times not saying without scratch but at least without broken bones and without special impact area
94832 was under the impression that particle accelerators were pretty harmless but some article said that they produce harmful radiation when youre in the tunnel given that the internet isnt always correct is this true
95023 we always hear how gravity bends space time why shouldnt velocity consider spaceship traveling through space at reasonable fraction of the speed of light if this spaceship according to special relativity gains mass as factor of as it approaches then its gravitational field should increase in strength as well hence space time should warp note changes in space time gravity and mass should only be measureable by an outside observer with different velocity those inside of the ship moving with it would not be able to measure the change in these properties
95254 can anyone explain why the error for ln where for we have pm delta is simply said to be frac delta would very much appreciate somewhat rigorous rationalization of this step additionally is this the case for other logarithms log 2x or how would that be done
95355 noticed the following qquad neq qquad 2l this would suggest that 2l have common system of eigenfunctions and so do 2l but dont how is that possible
95457 how can it be shown that the dirac spinor is the direct sum of right handed weyl spinor and left handed weyl spinor edit let psi and psi be component left handed and right handed weyl spinors their transformation properties are known when put these two spinors in column and construct four component column which is direct sum of psi and psi psi psi oplus psi this defined to be the dirac spinor right since it is direct sum under lorentz transformation the corresponding lorentz transformation matrix is diagonal right then it is easy to show that it satisfies the dirac equation in chiral basis right this is possible because we started from the definition of left handed and right handed weyl spinors and their transformation properties are known right this is explicitly carried out in the book by lewis ryder but suppose start the other way around solve the dirac equation in chiral basis then no one tells me that the upper two components are really left handed and lower two are really right handed suppose take this chiral basis solution of dirac equation and now take that to be my definition of dirac spinor then how can show the opposite that it is made up of two irreps of lorentz group psi psi oplus psi
95705 so with this arctic blast continuing ive noticed that for my area the temperature drops below freezing just long enough to cause freezing rain but then the sun comes out and the temperature rises immediately however on bridges ice continues to form how can ice form even if the temperature is above freezing
95779 this is from the beginning of srednickis qft textbook where he writes approximately in qm we associate unitary operator lambda to each proper orthochronous lorentz transformation lambda these operators must obey the composition rule lambda lambda lambdau lambda so far ok but where does he get the following from lambda lambda
95815 this question is consequence of another question of mine which is about spin here is my spin question what is the difference between these two fields how do they occur am right if say that magnetic field is about photons because they occur between and poles of magnet and an electric field is about electrons how they are related finally when and why do we use the word electromagnetism
95974 im philosophy student regrettably dont know calculus or much physics last year spent some time learning how work power speed velocity energy force and acceleration relate but was never able to fit my understanding of acceleration into my understanding of the world think my biggest challenge was understanding how you can have the per second per second part doesnt make sense to me and how that represents an increase in speed does it express every second thing travels meters second faster thats my best guess but see lot of problems with that guess so presume that its incorrect in words why is acceleration expressed as how does that expression relate if at all to the everyday notion of acceleration
95998 by definition average life of radioactive sample is the amount of time required for it to get decayed to of its original amount but what is the significance of and why has that value been chosen
96010 recently read that the mass that we deal with in the equation is called the inertial mass and the mass that we deal with in is called the gravitational mass find hard time understanding why we need these two different names its the stuff that makes up the ball that is responsible for pulling it towards the ground when dropped from height and it is the same stuff responsible in determining how hard should push it if want to accelerate it on level plane so why do we need to invent two different notions of mass in the first place what is the fundamental difference between the gravitational mass and the inertial mass that one should not apriori ignore have also read that the inertial mass and the gravitational mass are equivalent to each other and the general theory of relativity is based on this result so feel that there must be physical meaning to the equality of these two masses they shouldnt be trivially equal to each other how can fruitful physical theory the general theory of relativity be based on the equivalence between the two masses if they can be assumed equivalent apriori in other words want to say that the equality between the two masses must be physical result in order for theory to stem out of it it cannot be trivial mathematical identity otherwise it would be physically unfruitful so what is it that makes these two distinct concepts necessary in the first place and what forces upon us their equivalence
96033 im working on adapting some of the formalism in this paper to system im working with the part im interested in amounts to convolving density profile rhor with smoothing kernel sr epsilon the smoothing kernel used in this particular case is plummer smoothing sr epsilon frac pi frac epsilon epsilon and the density profile is left as general but spherically symmetric function the convolution incidentally im pretty sure this is correct use of the term convolution but would appreciate confirmation correction if im using it incorrectly want to evaluate is rho vec epsilon int vec rho vec vec vec epsilon following along with the paper this is going to be lot easier to evaluate in cylindrical coordinates with the vector vec lying along the axis and without too much difficulty arrive at the first part of his equation but get stuck trying to get the second part equation reads rhor epsilon frac epsilon int infty infty dz int infty drr frac rho left sqrt right epsilon frac epsilon int infty infty dz int infty drr frac rho left sqrt right epsilon tag he points out that the equality holds because the outer integral is taken over the entire axis but dont see how this follows couple details on the geometry the cylindrical coordinates are and and phi guess but that just gives pi is the distance from the origin of the spherically symmetric rhor it follows that vec sqrt and vec vec thought the solution might be as simple as translating everything along the axis bit something like tilde but that doesnt seem to work out my next hunch is that the trick that need to see has something to do with the behavior of lim to infty rhor this had better be zero to impose finite total mass of course this does not guarantee finite mass and indeed there are several commonly used density profiles that have unbounded total mass in practice they get truncated at some and they always still limit to as to infty but im still stuck so anyone see what makes that equality true
96045 su2 is the covering group of so3 what does it mean and does it have physical consequence heard that this fact is related to the description of bosons and fermions but how does it follow from the fact that su2 is the double cover of so3
96074 in thermodynamics the first law can be written in differential form as du delta delta here du is the differential form of the internal energy but delta and delta are inexact differentials which is emphasized with the replacement of with delta my question is why we regard heat or work as differential forms suppose our system can be described with state variables cdots to my understanding general form is written as df dx dx cdots dx in particular differential forms are linear functionals of our state variables is there any good reason to presuppose that delta is linear in the state variables in other words if the infinitesimal heat transferred when moving from state mathbf to mathbf mathbf is delta and from mathbf to mathbf mathbf is delta is there any physical reason why the heat transferred from mathbf to mathbf mathbf mathbf should be delta delta apologize if the question is bit unclear am still trying to formulate some of these ideas in my head know that for quasi static processes we have delta ds and delta dv so have shown delta is differential form in this case guess my question is about non quasi static processes in general
96081 my question is basically this is the second law of thermodynamics fundamental basic law of physics or does it emerge from more fundamental laws lets say was to write massive computer simulation of our universe model every single sub atomic particle with all their known behaviours the fundamental forces of nature as well as for the sake of this argument newtonian mechanics now press the run button on my program will the second law of thermodynamics become apparent in this simulation or would need to code in special rules for it to work if replace newtons laws with quantum physics does the answer change in any way fwiw im basically physics pleb ive never done course on thermodynamics and reading about it on the internet confuses me somewhat so please be gentle and dont assume too much knowledge from my side
96190 recently had the first physics lab for my university physics course this lab was fairly simple as we were merely using computer and distance sensor to graph the position velocity and acceleration of cart as it moved along linear track one of the situations we captured data for involved starting the cart at the bottom of an inclined ramp and giving it push upwards as expected it rolled up came to stop and then came back down the track to its starting position the position vs time graph was essentially parabolic the velocity vs time graph was essentially linear and the acceleration vs time graph was essentially linear so far so good at this point in the lab the instructor pointed out that if the data was examined closely the acceleration of the cart was greater while the cart was traveling upwards than when the cart was traveling downwards approximately frac and frac respectively and asked us to determine why in our lab report now gravity was the only force acting upon the cart and thus its acceleration should be constant at least at the scale our experiment was conducted at so these results are completely baffling my lab group so far we have proposed the following ideas but none of them seem very plausible doppler effect on the ultrasonic distance sensor friction air resistance human error the first seems highly improbable and the last three are more obfuscation and hand waving than actual theories why does our experimental data show the acceleration due to gravity to change based on the direction the object is moving
96327 so was thinking if heat feel is just lots of particles going wild and transferring their energy to other bodies why am not burned by the wind when thought about it more figured out that wind usually carries some humidity and since particles of liquid are moving same speed as the wind they are basically static relative to each other so no energy is transferred between them wind and water particles and if that water sticks to my skin and wind blows itll evaporate thus taking energy from my skin and make me feel cold thing is dont think thats really the case but even if it is if somehow dry out the wind will it burn me if its strong enough and winds can reach some pretty high velocities though must admit im not sure if they are comparable to movement of atoms in warm bodies etc so bottom line can be burned by wind in some perfect scenario
96362 what do we really mean when we say that the neutron and proton wavefunctions together form an rm su2 isospin doublet what is the significance of this what does this transformation really doing to the wavefunctions or fields
96466 we can derive lagrange equations supposing that the virtual work of system is zero delta sum mathbf dot mathbf delta mathbf sum mathbf mathbf dot mathbf delta mathbf where mathbf are the constrainded forces and are supposed to do no work which its true in most cases quoting goldstein the principle of virtual work is no longer true if sliding friction forces are present in the tally of constraint forces so understand that we should exclude friction forces of our treatmeant after some manipulations we arrive to frac dt frac partial partial dot frac partial partial further in the book the rayleigh dissipation function is introduced to include friction forces so given that frac partial mathcal partial dot and we get frac dt frac partial partial dot frac partial partial frac partial mathcal partial dot question isnt this an inconsistency of our proof how do we know the equation holds or is it just an educated guess which turns out to be true
96572 after testing electric motors realized that these motors draw current even when they are not moving do feel that these motors are trying to move but they are not really moving in the end why do these motors draw current even though they are not moving
96596 newtons law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction this law explains how rockets fly in space and it also accounts for the majority of the lift action generated by an airplanes wings is there fundamental quantum explanation of the third law of motion
96622 the gravity at the centre of star is zero as in the case of any uniform solid sphere with some mass when massive star dies why does it give rise to black hole at its centre know how to derive the field equations for gravity inside star assuming the star as uniform solid sphere of mass and radius need to know how to find the expression for the total pressure due to gravity at the centre
97713 could someone please explain to me the idea that schr dinger was trying to illustrate by the cat in his box understand that he was trying to introduce the notion of the cat being both alive and dead at the same time but why was it necessary to introduce this thought experiment and what did it achieve
97829 how much is known about the composition of ultra high energy cosmic rays say text ev get the impression that the particles are often assumed to be protons or other heavier nuclei but what empirical basis do we have for this is there experimental evidence that excludes photons or leptons as candidates do we know if the uhes are matter or antimatter understand that there is quite bit of literature examining the possible mechanisms of production of uhes as nuclei of various masses for example it could be easier for iron nuclei to get up to high energies in magnetic field since they would have to be accelerated for less time than protons however dont want to put the cart before the horse the fact is that we dont know where they come from and so we should not base our knowledge of what they are made of on these theories
97893 sometimes hear stories where people compare their feelings in winter in different places in the world it goes like in city the temperature was the same as in city but the humidity made me feel much colder or oh well would be cold but the humidity was low so it felt ok so it implies that humidity somehow makes it feel colder am talking about temperatures below freezing does this have any physical explanation or is it some sort of psychological phenomenon
97922 was going to school after rainy hour when saw some patches of shiny colours lying on road some small children surrounded that area and thought that its rainbow falling on the earth for some year old children it is serious thing have similar photo from google it is definitely not rainbow falling on the earth but what is it the road is busy road and hence think thats because of some pollutants oil or grease
97959 was reading about this water bottle by botl that behaves like canvas water bags to keep water cool found out that this idea is an old idea and cars would drive with water bags in front as shown below here is what found out about them it seeps water through the bag and evaporates causing the water to cool inside here is where need some help why does the water seep through the bag is it because the water molecules have maxwell speed distribution and only the fastest molecules seep out what mechanism is occurring for heat being removed from the water to evaporate the water on the bag surface doesnt radiation also contribute here why does moving increases the cooling effect faster
98011 can binary star system be possible where in one star is stationary and the other star revolves around it just like planet revolving star planets in the system and the star revolving around their own center of masses to balance the system
98119 understand that the flows of killing vector fields are isometries and that one parameter groups of isometries have an associated killing vector which generates them but are your killing vectors guaranteed to give you all possible isometries of the manifold guess what im trying to ask is do isometries necessarily come in families or can you have isolated isometries which cant have an associated killing vector field
98241 dimensional analysis and the notion that quantities with different units cannot be equal is often used to justify very specific arguments for example you might use it to argue that particular formula cannot possibly be the correct expression for particular quantity the usual approach to teaching this is to go well kids you cant add apples and oranges and then assume that the student will just find it obvious that you cant add meters and seconds im sorry but dont im not convinced meters plus seconds is screw your rules what are the units dont know actually dont understand what that question means im specifically not convinced when this sort of thing is used to prove that certain formulae cant possibly be right maybe the speed of comet is given by its period multiplied by its mass why not its perfectly meaningful operation just measure the quantities multiply them and claim that the number you get will always equal the current speed of the comet dont see how but it doesnt make sense to say mass times time is equal to distance divided by time can be valid counterargument particularly because dont really know what mass times time is but thats different issue if its relevant im math student and know extremely little about physics
98398 im quoting passage from my notes the development of clocks based on atomic oscillations allowed measures of timing with accuracy on the order of part in corresponding to errors of less than one microsecond one millionth of second per year do not understand what the accuracy of part in means does it mean that the atomic clocks can tell us the time accurate and certain to how should understand this moreover what is meant by the error of one microsecond per year is it kind of uncertainty in measurement how should understand it googled this topic and found information about the atomic clocks and also reviewed the definitions of accuracy and error however im not able to make any sensible connection between the concepts please help me thank you
98485 we have homogeneous body that looks like this have tried dividing the body into different parts using the following definition was thinking could first divide it into two parts using the axis and then add those two together using the definition above but how can calculate the coordinates for the center of mass for the lower part
98552 always think that it is not possible to escape from within event horizon however some one recently told me with deep conviction that it is possible with sustained energy output countered with calculations in schwarzschild metric showing that any objects below event horizon in the simplistic black hole will hit the singularity within finite proper time and was met with the response that schwarzschild metric was bad choice for coordinate system now understand that the singularity at frac 2gm in schwarzschild metric is an artifact of the coordinate choice and thus it seems that he could have point so my question is can one prove that it is or not possible to escape from within the event horizon of simple static black hole using better metric
98600 the mathematical universe hypothesis mainly by max tegmark and new kind of science mainly by stephen wolfram both claim as least as understand it that at its innermost core reality is mathematics can this statement be made more precise what is the exact relationship between these two hypotheses
98680 consider adiabatic canister with piston containing some gas kept in vacuum there are two weights on the canister which equalize the pressure of the gas on the piston assume the system is at equilibrium remove one weight from the piston the system will go out of equilibrium after some flux it will again settle into equilibrium clearly this is not quasi static process but its reversible one isnt it if put the weight back on the piston the system will again achieve its initial state how can non quasi static process be reversible edit according to wikipedia reversible process is process that can be reversed by means of infinitesimal changes in some property of the system without entropy production so if process can be reversed without the means of infinitesimal changes without entropy production would that qualify as reversible as in the example given above
98684 is correct to speak about frequency equal to frac if rightarrow infty can consider that the frequency is equal to
98703 in textbooks it is sometimes written that mixed state can be represented as mixture of assume here infty quantum pure states psi rangle with classical probabilities rho sum psi rangle langle psi tag above in and sum and do not necessarily assume that langle psi psi rangle if neq but require that langle psi psi rangle so that rho geq and tr rho there is another procedure to obtain mixed states using partial trace on composite system but am not interested on this here am not sure that it makes any sense to distinguish between classical probabilities embodied in the coefficients and quantum probabilities included in the pure states psi rangle representing the quantum part of the state this is because given rho as an operator there is no way to uniquely extract the numbers and the states psi rangle mean since rho rho dagger and rho is compact it is always possible for instance to decompose it on basis of its eigenvectors and there are many different decompositions leading to the same rho whenever rho has degenerate eigenspaces using non orthogonal decompositions many other possibilities arise rho sum phi rangle langle phi tag where again in and sum and now langle phi phi rangle delta ij do not think there is physical way to decide posteriori through suitable measurements of observables if rho has been constructed as the incoherent superposition or as the incoherent superposition the mixed state has no memory of the procedure used to construct it to pass from to one has in sense to mix apparently classical and quantum probabilities so do not think that it is physically correct to associate classical part and quantum part to mixed state since there is no unique physical way to extract them from it perhaps my impression is simply based on too naively theoretical interpretation of the formalism would like to know your opinions about this issue
98714 how are symmetries precisely defined in basic physics courses it is usual to see arguments on symmetry to derive some equations this however is done in kind of sloppy way we are calculating the electric field on semicircle wire on the top half plane on the origin since it is symmetric the horizontal components of the field cancel and we are left with the vertical component only arguments like that are seem lot now im seeing susskinds theoretical minimum courses and he defines symmetry like that symmetry is change of coordinates that lefts the lagrangian unchanged so if the lagrangian of system is invariant under change of coordinates that change is symmetry ive also heard talking about groups to talk about symmetries in physics ive studied some group theory until now but cant see how groups can relate to this notion of symmetry susskind talks about nor the sloppy version of the basic courses so how all those ideas fit together how symmetry is precisely defined for physicist
98761 from the book introduction to classical mechanics with problems and solutions by david morin page states noethers theorem for each symmetry of the lagrangian there is conserved quantity whereas the wikipedia page states noethers first theorem states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of physical system has corresponding conservation law does the action and lagrangian have identical symmetries and conserved quantities
98844 my knowledge of atomic dynamics is little superficial but to my understanding an electron travels an orbital path around nucleus of an atom correct so lets say that if hydrogen atom were to travel extremely close to the speed of light relative to some laboratory system with the electron circling the proton approximately already traveling extremely close to the speed of light how is it that the electron can circle the proton without exceeding light speed or does it continue to orbit at all
98966 this wikipedia article states that most steel engines have thermodynamic limit of is it correct if so then it is not clear where this number comes from is it derived somehow from carnots theorem tried to google it but found nothing usefull if this limit of is wrong then what is correct limit
99016 update people investigate and talk about orbital angular momentum oam of photons for example see this well cited paper here and the prl here the latter starts with the remark it is well known that photons can carry both spin and orbital angular momentum oam by definition photon is one particle state with definite momentum and helicity in quantum mechanics the oam doesnt commute with momentum and therefore momentum eigenstate is not an oam eigenstate by that logic individual photons cannot have definite oam does it mean that the situation changes in quantum field theory and particles with definite momentum can also have definite oam maggiores book on quantum field theory talks about the spin or helicity to be more precise of photons by working out the action of the spin operator on one particle photon states see my answer here brushing aside the action of oam operator im eager to understand the quantum field theory perspective of the oam of individual photons what is the oam of individual photons is there some physical example that cannot be explained without assuming that individual photons carry nonzero oam in addition to spin or helicity to be more precise

99252 what is the physical meaning of the kinetic term in the classical scalar field lagrangian mathcal kin frac partial mu phi partial mu phi it gives how does the field change from one space time point to the other right what is the significance of the relative minus sign between the square of the time gradient and square of the space gradient
99283 the representation frac frac of the lorentz group correspond to four vector or spin one object right does it imply that any four vector is identical to spin one object or any scalar is identical to spin object this cant be correct right because although mu is four vector and spin one object at the same time which is photon there is no concept of spin associated with mu or mu im confused by terminologies of representation edit how can show that mu represent spin object
99285 allow me to preface this by stating that am high school student interested in physics and self studying using variety of resources both on and off line primarily gsus hyperphysics website halliday resnicks fundamentals of physics taylors classical mechanics and ultimately the feynman lectures mirrored by caltech hopefully this gives somewhat of feel of my level of physics understanding so as to avoid any answers that fly far above my head as ive understood from previous reading of electromagnetism for example in halliday point charge is not affected by its own electromagnetic field unfortunately as recently read in the feynman lecture on electromagnetism this appears to not be so for those purists who know more the professors who happen to be reading this we should add that when we say that is complete expression of the knowledge of electrodynamics we are not being entirely accurate there was problem that was not quite solved at the end of the 19th century when we try to calculate the field from all the charges including the charge itself that we want the field to act on we get into trouble trying to find the distance for example of charge from itself and dividing something by that distance which is zero the problem of how to handle the part of this field which is generated by the very charge on which we want the field to act is not yet solved today so we leave it there we do not have complete solution to that puzzle yet and so we shall avoid the puzzle for as long as we can at first figured mustve misunderstood but upon rereading its clear feynman states the that electromagnetic field due to point charge does in fact influence said charge inferred this self force must be somewhat negligible for halliday to assert otherwise what stood out to me was that feynman states this problem had not yet been solved suppose my first major question is simply has this problem been solved yet after bit of research came across the abraham lorentz force which appears to refer exactly to this problem of self force as the article states the formula is entirely in the domain of classical physics and quick google search indicates it was derived by abraham and lorentz in why is it that feynman state the problem was still unsolved in has it been solved in the classical case but not in qed lastly despite the wikipedia article somewhat addressing the topic is this problem of self force present with other forces gravity believe it does state that standard renormalization methods fail in the case of gr and thus the problem is still present classically though it does mention that non classical theories of gravity purportedly solve the issue why is there not similar abraham lorentz esque force possible in gr is there an underlying fundamental reason due to the relative weakness of gravity can these self force effects be ignored safely in practice apologize for the long post size and appreciate any help can receive only hope my post isnt too broad or vague
99326 one way wikipedia defines ohm is this is also teached in school omega dfrac mbox mbox they describe this definition in words too the ohm is defined as resistance between two points of conductor when constant potential difference of volt applied to these points produces in the conductor current of ampere the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force the definition of ohm in si basic units is omega dfrac mbox kg cdot mbox mbox cdot mbox its really hard for me to get that this definition is correct its clear that mathematical calculations confirm this definition but how do you describe the definition of the si in words like that paragraph on wikipedia edit how would you describe it although it is not common to do it that way think describing it that way could be very interesting

99559 it is often stated that rotations in the spatial dimensions are examples of lorentz transformations but lorentz transformations form group named the lorentz group o13 which is group times matrices lambda having the following property lambda lambda where is the metric tensor now rotations matrices for the spatial dimensions are times matrices and form so3 how can they be in the o13
99590 do atoms have any uniquely identifying characteristic besides their history for example if we had detailed information about specific carbon atom from one of plancks fingerprints and could time travel to the cosmic event in which the atom formed would it contain information with which we could positively identify that they two are the same
99614 suspect that the factorial in the partition function for indistinguishable particles frac is an approximation please someone correct me if am wrong and why or why not thanks simple case each particle has two states with energy and the partition function for single particle is beta if there are only two particles there is the total partition function frac but regarding the whole system consisting of these two particles we can also write beta beta and it is certain that frac neq beta beta
99636 what if it was possible to ride an elevator straight through earth if we take all the heat and pressure problems away and assume it would be possible what would happen with gravity would gravity suddenly turn around as pass through the center and hit my head into the roof or would gradually get weightless as descend edit this is not duplicate the other questions does not involve an elevator car the other ones are about jumping into it

99906 we embed the rotation group so3 into the lorentz group o13 so3 hookrightarrow o13 and then determine the six generators of lorentz group from the rotation and boost matrices from the number of the generators we realize that o13 is six parameter matrix lie group but are there any other way to know the number of parameters of the lorentz group in the first place
99943 recently watched this presentation by brian greene on string theory in it he describes how the reason we dont observe the extra dimensions required by string theory could be because they are very small and hidden from us he uses an analogy of looking across parking lot at telephone wire from our vantage point the wire seems flat however to an ant crawling on the wire it would not seem flat at all the ant can see this clearly though the fact is hidden from us in our vantage point can see how this crude analogy can provide conceptualization of why possible other dimensions cannot be seen but dont see how this can in any way hint toward the extra dimension being small it seems to me that it is the object telephone wire that seems small to us because we are so far away this creates the illusion that the wire exists in two dimensions and not three this does not mean that the third dimension itself is small my question is what does it mean to call dimension small is this physical size or is this mathematical quantity expression that is associated with size for the benefit of the layman also if dimension can indeed have physical size then can we assign size to the three dimensions that we can see found similar phys se question here however the answers on this question deal more with how dimensions can be experimentally measured and did not completely answer my question
100277 is it logically correct to assert that the expectation of the momentum langle hat rangle for any bound state because it is bound to some finite region what is the physical interpretation of the fact that langle hat rangle in an energy eigenstate psi nxt but langle hat rangle neq0 in some superposition state psixt psi mxt psi nxt here psi nxt the eigenstates of the hamiltonian for example in the problem of particle in box say

100553 whenever someone asks why are complex numbers important the answer at least in the context of physics usually includes things like quantum mechanics oscillators and ac circuits this is all very fine but ive never seen anyone talk about functions of complex variable complex functions of real variables are used often enough but do not yet see with one minor exception see below why my university would decide to dedicate half semester to the theory of holomorphic functions if there are no physics applications dont get me wrong dont regret learning about complex functions think it is one of the most beautiful subjects within math but my question still stands are there any applications of functions mathbb to mathbb within physics about the exception if function is holomorphic then its components uv are automatically harmonic this is quick way to find solutions to laplaces equation nabla but surely this minor trick doesnt justify having to learn about the whole theory

100816 it is common wisdom and mathematically proven that quantum entanglement cannot be used to bypass the relativistic speed limit and transfer information faster than light so there must be something wrong with the following gedankenexperiment but cant figure out what let there be device which nearly simultaneously creates lots of entangled coherent photon pairs and sends them to alice and bob each of them receiving one photon of each pair both are far away from the light source and have placed screens into the highly focused light beam so that they detect some small area of light on the screen now alice wants to transfer one bit of information to bob if it is she does nothing if it is she puts an appropriate double slit plate into the light path immediately before the photon bunch arrives this will create an interference pattern on her screen and entanglement will instantly replicate the photons paths and such the pattern onto bobs screen so if he sees an interference pattern instead of dot he knows that its and vice versa of course bobs screen will not show an exact copy of what alice sees it will be olverlayed by noise from photons which bounced off alices double slit plate or decohered through environment interaction worst case statistical accident may create pattern out of bit which looks like the result of interference but we may optimize the signal noise ratio through the experimental setup and besides of that any real world communication channel is subject to partial information loss which must be compensated by error correction so it seems like this experiment transfers information faster than light what did miss
100951 does anyone know what feynman was referring to in this interview which appears at the beginning of the feynman tips on physics note that he is referring to something that did not appear in the feynman lectures didnt like to do the second year because didnt think had great ideas about how to present the second year felt that didnt have good idea on how to do lectures on electrodynamics but you see in these challenges that had existed before about lectures they had challenged me to explain relativity challenged me to explain quantum mechanics challenged me to explain the relation of mathematics to physics the conservation of energy answered every challenge but there was one challenge which nobody asked which had set myself because didnt know how to do it ive never succeeded yet now think know how to do it havent done it but ill do it someday and that is this how would you explain maxwells equations how would you explain the laws of electricity and magnetism to layman almost layman very intelligent person in an hour lecture how do you do it ive never solved it okay so give me two hours of lecture but it should be done in an hour of lecture somehow or two hours anyhow ive now cooked up much better way of presenting the electrodynamics much more original and much more powerful way than is in the book but at that time had no new way and complained that had nothing extra to contribute for myself but they said do it anyway and they talked me into it so did did this approach to teaching electrodynamics appear in any of his later writing

101402 have differential operator displaystyle frac partial partial frac partial partial can trivially hit this operator to xyz and as but have problem with exponential of that operator want to hit this operator to xyz and as well expi eta eta is rapidity in this case the first thing that comes to my mind is to use definition of exponential of an operator displaystyle expa frac frac but dont know why dont want to use this infinite sum there should be smart way of doing this do you have any suggestions for me
101461 here is why pose this question as advance in physics more and more this idea haunts me and in fact helped me figure out and memorize many physical laws it seems to me that there is relation between all the laws of physics something that is general law that determines how should all other laws be generally stated cant express this law in complete sentence and im not able to verify if it has an exception or not but will try to explain this by examples to show what really mean mechanics oscillations it seems that the whole process happens because the object is trying to get back into its initial state the origin electricity lenzs law an induced electromotive force emf always gives rise to current whose magnetic field opposes the original change in magnetic flux in other words the current is trying to get its initial state by resisting the change of current atoms radiation and nuclear reactions happen because the atom is trying to be stable of course there are many other examples but im just stating few to make my point the question is is there something like that in physics if not can you give me any counter example on this

101895 the speed of sound depends on the density of the medium in which it is travelling and increases when the density increases for example in solids sound travels faster than in liquid and even faster than in gas and the density is highest in solids lower in liquids and lowest in gas so iron has density of about kg while mercury has kg but the speed of sound is in mercury and in iron so mercury has higher density but sound travels slower in it why is this
101913 was trying to unlock my car with keyfob but was out of range friend of mine said that have to hold the transmitter next to my head it worked so tried the following later that day walked away from the car until was out of range put key next to my head it worked put key on my chest it worked put key on my leg didnt work so first thought it has to do with height of the transmitter but am out of range if use the key at the same height as my head but not right next to my head same applies when my key is at the same height as my chest so it has nothing to do with height as it appears then thought my body is acting like an antenna but how is that possible if am holding the key why would it only amplify the signal if hold it against my head and not if simply hold it into my hand heres vid of top gear demonstrating it
101919 there are few questions in phys se concerning the speed of gravity and the answers are traditionally that the speed of gravity equals to the speed of light but in that case have three more specific questions which didn find in those discussions so let me ask them here separately all cosmological and astrophysical body simulation codes the popular gadget code calculate gravitational force acting on given particle from all other particles taking their positions at the same moment of time well that perhaps adequate if one simulates small stellar cluster but how can that be adequate when one simulates large scale structure of the universe but most weird thing is that failed to find any justification for that either in manuals or in internet discussions as if it is just obvious that gravitational interaction acts instantaneously irrelevant of the separation astronomers calculate orbits and predict positions of celestial objects without taking into account the finite speed of gravity and yet they get accurate results they do make correction for the time that will take light to travel from the object to the earth to observe it in its predicted position but if similar correction is introduced for gravity itself the result becomes in fact incorrect if the speed of gravity does not exceed the speed of light how can black holes produce gravitational fields the mass of the black hole is under the event horizon and yet it manages to update its external gravitational field whereas in fact the black hole should not reveal itself even gravitationally in this case the last two questions are actually spurred by the paper of tom van flandern the speed of gravity what the experiments say phys lett that have come across recently in fact there are more interesting points raised in the paper concerned with aberration gravity has no observed aberration though it should have it if it propagates at the speed of light and the ultimate conclusion is that the speed of gravity is at least ten orders of magnitude higher than the speed of light there is some reaction to the paper for example steven carlip aberration and the speed of gravity phys lett but carlip focuses on aberration and concludes that in general relativity aberration might in fact be cancelled by velocity dependent interactions but what about the three questions outlined above for me the most striking fact is that in predicting positions of celestial objects the speed of gravity is taken to be infinite and predictions turn out to be correct if that is the case don understand at all why we are still taught that nothing can travel faster than light can anyone clear up the situation in more or less simple terms
102032 almost as soon as turn my kettle on it starts to make the familiar kettle noise yet very shortly after turning off the power the boiling noise stops and the kettle is totally silent the temperature of the water is almost the same as when turned it off so why is there only noise when energy is being added to the water
102097 since energy can always be shifted by constant value without changing anything why do books on quantum mechanics bother carrying the term hbar omega around to be precise why do we write hbar omegan frac instead of simply hbar omega is there any motivation for not immediately dropping the term
102222 carbon has half life of years that means that after years half of that sample decays after another years quarter of the original sample decays and the cycle goes on and on and one could use virtually any radioactive isotope why is this so logically shouldnt it take years for the quarter to decay rather than
102259 what is electromotive force emf how is it related to the potential difference is it created by the potential difference in any conductor is it process why is it called force does writing emf instead of voltage make any difference in ac circuits studying alternating current found some books using emf while others used voltage
102315 am familiar with the equation vec vec am wondering as to whether it is possible for something to exert force on another object without changing the momentum of said object my question is is force defined as change of momentum if that is the case my question is pointless but if it is not what is the underlying framework also when some phenomena causes the spins or angular momentum of subatomic particles to change does it mean that the phenomena caused the particle to accelerate or decelerate what is force in the framework of quantum mechanics does the definition of force only apply in classical mechanics sidenote am not very familiar with quantum mechanics apologize beforehand
102409 with only limited knowledge of general relativity usually explain space time curvature to myself and others thus if you throw ball it will move along parabola initially its vertical speed will be high then it will slow down and then speed up again as it approaches the ground in reality the ball in moving in straight line at constant velocity but the space time curvature created by the earths gravitation makes it appear as if the ball is moving in curved line at varying velocity thus the curvature of space time is very much visible is this an accurate description or is it complete nonsense
102410 edit know there have been some similar questions but dont think any had quite articulated my particular confusion if gauge symmetries are really just redundancies in our description accounting for nonphysical degrees of freedom then how does one explain the deep and powerful fact that if one begins with say just fermions and no gauge field in ones theory no interactions no dynamics but then imposes that the theory be invariant under local u1 transformations then one finds vector field must be introduced note that did not have any vector field in my theory before demanded invariance under gauge symmetry if one thinks of the vector field as being in the theory to begin with then can see how one could see the imposition of local symmetry as necessary constraint to remove extra degrees of freedom youve got an mu that things got degrees of freedom and it should only have but if imagine that knew nothing about photons or the electromagnetic field and require my theory of fermions to have this u1 symmetry then the vector potential arises as the mechanism for enforcing that symmetry beginning with no interactions axiomatically or arbitrarily requiring gauge symmetry has the power to produce not only gauge fields in the theory but the correct number of them and with the correct self interactions or lack of them suppose one could say that su3 just happens to work because there just happen to be gluons similarly for su2 and u1 but doesnt that seem awfully random and clunky or unnatural doesnt it seem much more natural and coherent to say that there are gluons precisely because there are generators of su3 and so on if begin my theory without the gauge fields then it seems to me to make no sense to say that the shockingly powerful principle of requiring gauge invariance only accounts for redundancy in field that have not even put in my theory yet and might not want to cannot get away with imposing gauge invariance without introducing exactly the kind of forces and interactions that we observe and that appear in the sm that statement seems way too powerful for mere redundancy in our description again maybe its true that if you go about it from the other direction ie requiring one photon and three weak gauge bosons etc then you are forced to introduce the right gauge symmetry to account for the redundancies but that seems much more ad hoc to me you have lot of random things that happen to be true and lot of coincidences that happen to work out whereas if you think about the requirement of gauge symmetry as giving rise to these connections that tell you how to move around in your bundle that sort of communicate the local transformation from one place to another then you are only making one ad hoc postulate and it is concise and elegant one with ridiculous amount of explanatory power it also seems weird to call the very thing that defines theory only dumb redundancy in the theory so where am wrong in all this is this an untenable view in the context of gauge theory neglecting ideas that are being researched that may or may not pan out or is this viable view to take even if one you dislike it know very little about spinor helicity methods but gather they may have something to say about this does their success eliminate the possibility of my interpretation

102822 let me first give you the tensile strength of both substances diamond mpa steel mpa as you guys should know tensile strength is how much material can be stressed or pulled before it breaks the data above shows that diamond is more brittle than steel but thought diamond is the strongest natural object in this planet how can it be more brittle than something which is man made dont the strong covalent bonds in between the carbon atoms resist the pull and carry through huge amount of weight
102941 the mathrm u1 qed case has two physical degrees of freedom which is easy to understand because the free electromagnetic field must be transverse to the direction of propagation but what are the physical degrees of freedom the mathrm sun yang mills theory believe that the mathrm sun theory has four degrees of freedom and it is easy to see that by gauge fixing such as the lorentz condition or the coulomb condition that we can always remove one redundant degree of freedom but then we still havent completely fixed the redundant degrees of freedom thus my question is how many physical degrees and how many are redundant degrees of freedom does the theory have would be interested to understand how we can determine this mathematically and also to understand what the physical intuition behind this is
103024 consider there is box of mass at rest on the floor most books give an example that we need to do work of mgh to lift the box upward if we analyze this work done the external force acting on the box by us should be equal to the weight of the box therefore the net force is zero which in turn there is no acceleration if there is no acceleration and the initial velocity of the box is also zero how can the box move upward
103171 why we say that em waves are transverse in nature have seen some proofs regarding my question but they all calculate flux through imaginary cube here is my real problem that cant here imagine infinitesimal area for calculating flux because em line of force will intersect perpendicular or not surface at only one point so ds will be zero so even flux through one surface of cube will always be zero am bit confused dont know vector calculus but know calculus
103328 was always told when first learning qft that linear terms in the lagrangian are harmless and we can essentially just ignore them however ive recently seen in the linear sigma model begin equation cal frac partial mu phi partial mu phi frac phi phi frac lambda phi phi end equation with mu adding linear term in one of the fields phi does change the final results as you no longer have goldstone bosons since the on symmetry is broken to begin with are there any other effects of linear terms that we should keep in mind or is this the only exception of the forget about linear terms rule

103516 today have by accident thrown aaa battery into bucket of water fished it out of the water immediately within seconds or so and nothing notable had happened and the battery is still full according to battery test device as the water should have short circuited the battery would have expected that something should have happened at least that the battery should have been emptied rather quickly is my expectation wrong is there something that didnt think of or was the time the battery spent in water was just too short to substantially drain it
103535 the question if the three vector electric and magnetic fields come from the four component four potential then is there fourth component to the electric and magnetic field related question posted the following question what is the physical significance of the dipole transformation of maxwells equations remember along time ago wrote maxwells equations down and crossed the fields with the position vector and was able to transform maxwells equations from monopole charge source to something that appeared to be dipole sourced field equations when did this it revealed bizarre fourth component in the field equations which think might be related to this question
103576 the first cartan equation is mathrm omega theta wedge omega where omega is an orthonormal basis is the torsion and theta is the spin connection in misner thorne and wheeler as well as several lectures in general relativity ive seen using the cartan formalism they assume to then use the first equation to determine the connections why is it valid to assume in general relativity that the torsion is zero

104101 it seems intuitive that propto frac as the greater the force that is applied on an object the greater its acceleration will be inversely the greater the mass of the object the slower the acceleration will be however when rewriting proportions as equations you must introduce constant of proportionality and in this case of direct proportion if propto frac then when rewriting as an equation you will have cdot frac in order to get the standard formula ma this constant must be however how do we know that this is the case how do we know that the constant isnt and the formula frac ma for instance

104563 consider the hamiltonian frac 2m in it is invariant under rightarrow again this hamiltonian also has translational symmetry which one of these two is responsible for doubly degenerate energy eigenfunctions for given energy think it is the first one should call it parity symmetry am right we know any symmetry appears as degeneracy in quantum mechanics right then what is the manifestation of translational symmetry
104653 visible light emitted or reflected from the objects around us provides information about the world if sit in dark room and see the bright room outside am able to see all the objects of that bright room in other words it mean light emitted or reflected from those objects of the bright room are entering into the dark room shouldnt that make my room bright but my room is dark and am able to see those objects of bright room both are contrary edit if we consider another situation like the one in the picture below lets assume that we move as far from the street light that even in the presence of street light the place remains as dark as it was before believe even then we can see the street light wont we if we agree that we still can see the lamp it mean that we are able to see the lamp without the ray from lamp hitting our eye wont it be contrary edit lets consider laser beam in the dark room in the picture room is not totally dark but assume dark room look the laser in the same angle as shown in the picture as laser remains narrow over long distance hope we can assume light is not spreading in other directions but hope we can see it even though light is not spreading and reaching me how is it possible
104793 want to know why is it that it is easier to cut through string which is tightened then loose one the question arose when was watching what happened next in part they showed two clips each one demonstrating the crash of rotor blades of helicopter with cable horizontally hanging in air clip cable is of something like brass cant remember exactly what material that was and it was stretched helicopter rises the rotor blades crash with the cable and the cable vanishes out of sight the giant vehicle is perfectly alright clip cable is of steel it is loosely hanging helicopter rises the rotor blades crash with the cable and cable only dances bit and comes back to its position the flying machine gets devastated reason according to the shows narrator the difference arises from the point that the materials were different and due to the difference in tension of the cables

104857 was wondering wether it would make difference in general if were to were introduce the gauge covariant derivative mu partial mu iea mu in the lagrangian density and then derive the equations of motion or if were to derive the equations of motion and then introduce the gauge covariant derivative checked this for the klein gordon and dirac equations where it made no difference at all my guess is that it would make no difference at all since we introduce this one to make our system action equations of motion gauge invariant so it doesnt really matter at which point id introduce the gauge covariant derivative but im unsure if this reasoning is correct to make the question really basic guess it comes to the question do we always need to introduce the local symmetries in the action or can we wait with that untill the equations of motion edit im also big believer of the fact that you just substitute the covariant derivative into the action to introduce your interacitons this is the way to go since noethers theorem works with the action and this theorem guarantees the conserved quantities now im studying quarks leptons an introductory course in modern particle physics by halzen martin and when they study qed of spin particles chapter in my edition which is the edition apperently they introduce the gauge covariant derivative in the equations of motion in stead of the action somewhere this has some logic to me since if your system is invariant under some kind of symmetry the the equations of motion should be invariant for this kind of transformation as well otherwise two solutions related by symmetry transformation wouldnt yield the same result think this is what theyre proving here arxiv org abs but im not sure to which extent this goes of course as said in comment to one of the answers if you want to give your vectorfield mu general dynamics you need yang mills theory ans some kind of kinetic term for this field in this case you need lagrangian to unify both dynamics edit2 qmechanics answer also gives very nice scematic version of the question just for reference

105256 read that the sodas temperature allows it to contain its text co colder means it can retain its bubbles better so why does soda fizz when it meets ice if anything because the soda is made colder it should retain its gas better as per above the ice is taking away energy from the soda thus freezing wont heating not freezing encourage the gas to escape or is it not an energy matter
105318 it seems to me that hamiltonian formalism does not suit well for problems involving instantaneous change of momentum like particle collisions with hard wall or hard sphere gas model at least could not apply it straightforwardly to the simplest possible problem of 1d particle hitting wall wall particle my attempt was quite direct took the hamiltonian to be frac 2m ux with potential defined as ux cases 5em 5em where is the particle energy and hamiltonian equations should read as cases dot frac 6em dot frac it is not hard to integrate the first equation but my attempts to integrate the second one did not lead to any meaningful result thats why do not share them here it was complete failure so ask whether it is possible to obtain the solution to the problem by directly integrating hamiltonian equations in the form above without relying on general mechanical theorems principles like energy conservation or is such an approach completely unsuitable for the task if so what is the general and elegant approach to such systems there exist related question on pse hamiltonian function for classical hard sphere elastic collision but the setting is more cumbersome

105439 found some websites trying to attribute this to the external other forces affecting the body problem to follow an elliptical rather than circular orbit but am not convinced though think any body problem can have an elliptical orbit isolated from other external forces as this is the general solution of keplers first law if derived from newtons law of universal gravitation can we for example say that initial formation conditions are the main cause

105707 water appears transparent to visible light yet most other objects are opaque why is that is there an explanation why water appears transparent is water transparent at all wavelengths or are the visible wavelengths somehow special if it is not transparent at all wavelengths is there some evolutionary explanation why we would expect water to have low absorption at the wavelengths that we can see with our eyes is there some explanation along the lines of because we evolved in an environment where water plays some important role therefore its not surprising that our eyes are sensitive to wavelengths where water has low absorption

105782 remember reading somewhere that the problem of exact time keeping on ships could have been solved lot earlier than it was if somebody would have had the idea of keeping time with whole array of imprecise clocks taking the average of clock times would have given precise time using the same reasoning could measure the length of stick to atomic precision by showing it to enough people and having them guess at its length
105802 the one dimensional wave equation is the second order linear partial differential equation frac partial partial frac frac partial partial tag second order pde that admits as its solutions functions of the form fx pm vt tag solution as can be verified in straight forward manner these solutions have convenient interpretation that justifies the phrase wave equation noticed there are first order partial differential equations which have as solutions functions of the form fx pm vt frac partial partial pm frac frac partial partial tag first order pde quick google search shows this is indeed called the first order wave equation but it usually shows up in the context of math classes so now the question why is the usual second order pde favored over these first order ones if both admit the same solutions is there physical reason are this first order equations useful in their own right perhaps there other solutions that one admits that isnt desired or maybe it just looks cleaner since one doesnt have to carry around the pm symbol in the differential equation

106023 am familiar with how transformer works this is the diagram that found on the wikipedia page the current through the red solenoid varies with time which creates time dependent magnetic flux green that also goes through the blue solenoid therefore inducing an electromotive force both solenoids are wrapped around magnetic object so that this carries the magnetic flux created inside the solenoid which is much bigger than the one outside of it around am not quite sure why the magnetic flux bends in the way displayed in the diagram the magnetic material is ferromagnetic right so shouldnt the magnetic field point produced inside the red solenoid force all the other domains to align with it in other words shouldnt the magnetic field point in the same direction everywhere in the magnetic material as have tried to illustrate below
106066 if take two plane em waves travelling in opposite direction sinkx omega and sin kx omega they sum to give standing wave with time averaged poynting vector of zero if use the appropriate special relativistic transformations to derive how these fields appear to an observer travelling at along the axis find that one field is diminished one is boosted whilst at the same time one wave is blue shifted and the other red shifted these waves do not sum to give standing wave in the moving frame of reference and have non zero time averaged poynting vector so is the phenomenon of standing wave dependent on the frame of reference of the observer please note that have tried transforming the fields and summing them but could not make sense of the result in terms of travelling wave or standing wave hence the question to get the bounty im looking for form for prime or decomposition of prime that isnt just the sum of the transformed waves that makes clear the nature of the summed waves in the moving frame

107031 are there any qm effects that have been could be measured from interactions involving non charged particles elementary qm is all about the electron energy levels in the atom photon atom interactions etc when one looks at the nucleus its all about quark interactions which are also charged particles can think of some theoretical ones like neutrinos orbiting mass but they would be hard to impossible to measure another possibility is the strong weak nuclear force but that always happens with particles that are also charged in the end we always need matter built instruments to see result thats fine you could for instance observe photons coming from some distant metres to mpc away region where some interaction occurred
107061 imagine we have cup with of water and cup smaller in width than with of water now put cup into cup if the width of both cups are of comparable size then the cup with of water floats it does not touch the bottom of cup now think about archimedes law of flotation it says that the weight of displaced liquid weight of the floating object however in this case the bottom cup has only of water how can an object float without displacing water equal to its own weight am not applying archimedes principle correctly or because of both things beings of comparable size archimedes principle does not apply
107152 why must an integrating sphere be sphere why cant it be an integrating cube what is the difference could use cube to measure total illuminance like an integrating sphere does
107165 at university was shown the schrodinger equation and how to solve it including in the potential modelling the hydrogen atom and it was then asserted that the differences between the eigenvalues of the operator were the permitted frequencies of emitted and absorbed photons this calculation agrees with experimentally measured spectral lines but why would we expect it to be true even if we accept that the electron moves according to the schrodinger equation after all theres no particular reason for an electron to be in an eigenstate what would make people think it was anything more than very suggestive coincidence
107171 the the title is self explanatory guess why can two or more electric field lines never cross
107191 diagrams of rocket engines like this one source always seem to show combustion chamber with throat followed by nozzle why is there throat wouldnt the thrust be the same if the whole engine was shaped combustion chamber with nozzle
107443 when learned about the minkowski space and its coordinates it was explained such that the metric turns out to be ds dx dx dx dx where 0x 1x 2x come from mu mu and is the speed of light the first resource had access to have to do bit of digging for the exact paper of course addressed that this invariant takes the tensor form ds mu nu dx mu dx nu as well this two things ive seen in all of my texts and online resources regarding resources the element in question that varies between authors is the time coordinate when it was first explained to me it was using the standard cartesian representation for the spatial portion of the coordinates and the time coordinate was labeled as ict squaring gives 2t and applying differential calculus we get dx 2dt sensible and expected to have the tensor formula spit out the minkowski metric the author then later explicitly states the coordinates are ict xx and my questions is then why is it most authors on the subject omit the imaginary unit on the time coordinate for example here the only reason can fathom omission is if the author is using metric signature where started off learning the theory with signature which may be the reason seeing the time coord with no imaginary unit seems dissonant to me all help appreciated edit after reading the other answers my questions is now one of why and how mathematically do we obtain the minkowski metric signature more specifically the one element with different sign
107584 is it possible to use the lagrangian formalism involving physical terms to answer the question of why all planets are approximately spherical lets assume that planet is born when lots of particles of uniform density are piled together and constrained only by the newtonian gravity of the particles with no external gravity my question is is it possible to use the variational calculus starting from this situation to prove that planets should be spherical

107824 what is the difference between stress and pressure are there any intuitive examples that explain the difference between the two how about an example of when pressure and stress are not equal
107845 assume point mass is travelling in straight line and force will act on in the same direction as velocity over constant distance why doesnt velocity matter to the calculation of work done on by work is defined such that in this example the work done by on is equal to fd but it seems that if were moving slower it would spend more time in the field allowing more time to act on thereby doing more work in fact if velocity were very great it would hardly spend time in field at all so very little work done maybe misunderstand work can someone address this confusion of mine
107904 there are claims like this one that you can improve the cooling speed of beverages when you put them wrapped in wet paper towel inside the refrigerator freezer ive just tried it by myself and it seems it does not work as expected although might have confused freezer with refrigerator my question is this kind of an urban legend or does it actually help
107930 ive heard that light can form curve if they travel near high mass stars or even black hole with strong gravity which is according to this newtonian formula large dfrac gm 1m but ive also heard that photons do not have rest mass so it doesnt fit that equation anymore but why can photons be pulled by gravities without rest mass could someone explain that
107963 einstein originally thought that special relativity was about light and how it always travelled at the same speed nowadays we think that special relativity is about the idea that there is some universal speed limit on the transfer of information and experiments tell us that photons the quanta of light move with the largest speed but what if tomorrow we happen to observe particle that travels with speed what changes would have to be made to special relativity
108008 we know that in the quantum harmonic oscillator dagger dagger will span lie algebra where dagger are the annihilation and creation operators and is the hamiltonian operator ha dagger dagger ha aa dagger so these four operators dagger dagger can span lie algebra because the commutator satisfies closure and jacobis identity we know that for any lie algebra mathscr there exists only one lie group up to difference in the topology whose lie algebra is mathscr so what is this lie group whose lie algebra is spaned by dagger dagger
108014 if photon hits perfect mirror with no environment interference would the mirror move bit
108224 we know due to maxwells equations that vec nabla cdot vec but if we get far from the magnetic field shouldnt it be weaker shouldnt the divergence of the field be positive if we define the vector field as function of distance then if the distance increases then the magnitude of the vector applied to distant point of the source should be weaker is my reasoning correct
108413 disk of radius is oriented with its normal unit vector hat at circ to uniform electric field vec of magnitude what is the electric flux through the disk know that electric flux is given by the following equation phi oint vec cdot hat da my question is that if youre integrating over region and its with respect to da how is this not double integral why is phi int int pi vec cdot hat theta dr not right
108546 is there some historical reasons or is there specific reason behind it this question is connected to why on shell vs off shell matters
108626 question the value of permittivity of vacuum epsilon is given with absolutely no uncertainty in nist why is this the case more details the permeability of vacuum can be given by mu frac epsilon which comes from the definition of magnetic field in special relativity where we solve the problem of wire with electrons flowing in and we calculate the force exerted on an external charge moving with some velocity for details refer to the book electricity and magnetism purcell and we define new field called magnetic field with the form of lorentz force where the magnetic field is frac pi epsilon where is the current due to the flow of electrons in the wire and is the distance of the external charge from the wire and there we get the definition of mu that makes frac mu pi and there starts the concept magnetism why am giving this detailed example because wouldnt like to get the answer that mu has no error and thats why epsilon has no error and then we fall into circular logic so expect reason which is independent of mu thank you in advance
108802 cant wrap my head around this idea because dont know much about air flows say we have this imaginary apartment with two windows one of which is two times smaller than the other will the first one let more air through than the second or is it the same because of the smallest window how does this work
108817 to start with know thermodynamics deals with processes at equilibrium hence the thermodynamic pressure should most likely be the pressure of fluid at equilibrium im not sure if fluid flow in general unsteady is in thermodynamic equilibrium say flow in channel which has pressure gradient and so would the static pressure at point in the channel be different from the thermodynamic pressure what does this entail about the ideal gas law rho rt can it be used for moving flow what is the pressure in the equation referring to mechanical or thermodynamic edit to clear up any confusion in given flow we can measure the pressure at any point say using pitot tube to get the stagnation and static pressure my question is then is the static pressure we measure which is by definition an force area quantity any different from the thermodynamic pressure the pressure in rho rt must be referring to the thermodynamic pressure since the equation is derived purely from the laws of thermodynamics however in all literature have encountered compressible flows use the ideal gas equation to as link between the incompressible variables mathbf and the full set of compressible variables mathbf rho so it seems the two pressures are equivalent
108925 everyone calls the centrifugal force pseudo force and claims that it is not really present even though there are so many machines listed as taking advantage of it centrifuge washing machine drier it also has the same magnitude as the centripetal force so that they cancel each other out but can definitely feel it every time take sharp turn in car so can you explain whether the centrifugal force is real
108971 it just occurred to me that almost all images ive seen of the infamous mushroom cloud show vertical column rising perpendicular to the ground and horizontal planar ring parallel to the ground not that im an expert thats why this question but have rarely seen anything go in the degree angle or for that matter anything other than the special degree horizontal plane and degree vertical column shouldnt there be radial vectors at all angles between and degrees giving rise to hemispherical explosion envelope why is it vertical cylinder ps understand the top expands eventually on cooling and lowered air pressure giving the mushroom look but my questions is for the previous stage the vertical column
109142 we have seen birds sitting on uninsulated electric wires of high voltage transmission lines overhead without getting harmed because sitting on only one wire doesnt complete any circuit but what about the potential difference between their legs is this not small complete circuit because the wire has potential gradient there should be potential difference between the birds feet is this potential difference so very small that we can say the bird is sitting at single point on the wire if bird of sufficiently large size with wide gap between its feet sits on single wire shouldnt the bird receive shock if the potential difference is sufficient
109343 why dont people discuss the eigenstate of the field operator for example the real scalar field the field operator is hermitian so its eigenstate is an observable quantity
109346 left ij right epsilon ijk left im right epsilon ijk left im right epsilon ijk where is the generator of rotation of lorentz group is the generator of boost of lorentz group in many textbook of qft they say that the second one implies that the generators of the boosts transform like vector under rotations but cant see it explicitly can anyone give me the explanation
109368 im new to physics and am just going through some of the free online classes at world science and after watching this video on the nature of the speed of light and its constancy question came to mind about photons video youtube video world science course know that photons dont have mass but what happens when photons even the photons from distant stars reach us are we merely observing the occurrence of photons moving through space relative to us or are we really being bathed in photons know that when observe rain can both observe it from distance but could also be immersed in it as well if in the path of that rain but with distant starlight are we just observing it or are the photons actually reaching and penetrating the earth around us if they are penetrating does science tell us what is actually happening on an atomic or sub atomic level
109533 am having bit of crisis in understanding of the physical meanings of total derivatives when quantity rho be it vector or scalar is said to be conserved then mathematically frac rho dt right now if just integrate both sides with respect to time get rho constant but the total derivative can be written as via the chain rule frac rho dt frac partial rho partial mathbf cdot nabla rho where am not even sure what mathbf is the speed of moving reference frame given these equations if the former has rho constant as solution then what is the point of partial derivative and gradients they are all going to be zero anyway and what exactly is the physical meaning of the total derivative in fluid dynamics and plasma physics have been told that it describes how quantity changes when observed from the frame moving with the fluid
109535 know this isnt the right place for asking this question but in other places the answers are so awfull im studying eletricity so start seeing things like charges electrons has negative charges etc but didnt quite understand what charge is search little bit on the internet and found it related to electromagnetic fields then thought negative and positive may be associeted with the behaviour of the particle in the field great but the articles about fields already presuppose negative and positive charges in other places see answers relating charges to the amount of electrons protons in an atom but if thats right the negative electron is an atom without any protons what about the neutron so my questions are what are charges and how particle can be electrically charged what does that really mean thanks for your time
109536 suppose that in the intergalactic space far from any significant gravitational attractors there is relatively small concentration of he atoms due to gravitational attraction fermions in this case would form sphere gas planet but as bosons he atoms arent affected by exclusion prinicple so whats holding them back from collapsing into singularity
109731 know change our vision of space and time as unique surface than can bend we can associate the curvature of the space time as the gravity created by the mass of planets stars but how can we measure the curvature of the space time for calculate as an example the position of star
109736 as you know impedance is defined as complex number ideal capacitors frac omega hspace pc mathrm or hspace pc frac sc ideal inductors omega hspace pc mathrm or hspace pc sl know that the reason why they invented the concept of impedance is because it makes it easy to work with circuits in the frequency domain or complex frequency domain however since in real life circuits both voltages and currents are real numbers im wondering if there is any actual physical meaning behind the imaginary component of impedance
109738 in many presentations of statistical mechanics where we have system of particles having mass such as the molecules of an ideal gas the temperature is often equated to the average relative velocity of the particles however no such velocity can exceed that of light is there therefore an absolute upper bound to temperature as well as an absolute zero
109739 is photosynthesis more efficient than solar panels if so by how much
109833 water is normally assumed to be an incompressible fluid for example in the context of calculations involving water pressure wondered whether that is strictly true or an approximation later noticed some side note implying water is not fully incompressible of course that makes sense as there are not many things perfect in nature in this sense like maybe supraconductivity and suprafluidity now why or in what kind of way is water only almost incompressible is it caused by impurities like gases and other fluids in the water or is it not completely incompressible in some fundamental way
109877 im aware my question might be considered duplicate of this one radio dating and the age of the earth read that one and looked everywhere and still cant find my piece of mind would really like to understand the following points does one uranium nucleus start the radioactive decaying process the instant it is born inside supernova understand that for single nucleus the chance of decaying which is an instantaneous event grows from to in the time from the beginning to the half life while talking about collection of atoms wikipedia states here that this predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as clock to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into material to the present johnrennie helped me understand that chemically speaking zircon and lead do not mix whereas zircon and uranium do so basically macroscopic contamination via accretion with flying lead is an event too rare to take into consideration right also understand that the uranium lead decay series has very short half lives for every nuclide except for the beginning and the end uranium and lead and so from cosmological perspective its quite improbable that zircon would mix with anything other than uranium should chemical compatibility exist with another nuclide please bare with me and excuse my highly scientific vocabulary have an experiment would like to imagine in order to discover what im doing wrong star goes supernova we concentrate our attention on one uranium nucleus which is fused together during the violent event the uranium nucleus travels for millenia towards the an accretion cloud surrounding newborn star the nucleus collides with brand new molten zircon crystal and becomes part of it lets say that event was happening after uranium half lives and the uranium nucleus still hadnt decayed isnt it imminent that the nucleus will decay pretty soon after event mean understand that if the nucleus wouldve become thorium or protactirium or lead it wouldntve gotten stuck in the crystal for chemical reasons but if it was still uranium what does that say about the internal clock of the nucleus which had been ticking for of the half life is that clock reset because of external electromagnetic reasons the moment the nucleus becomes part of the crystal thank you for your indulgence

109888 if jump in my pool on the river near my house knowing that nuclear bomb or atomic or bomb exploded around km from my house would survive the way see it is that water will protect me from the heat so then will be able to surface up after the explosion and escape
109897 was having conversation with my father and father in law both of whom are in electric related work and we came to point where none of us knew how to proceed was under the impression that electricity travels on the surface while they thought it traveled through the interior said that traveling over the surface would make the fact that they regularly use stranded wire instead of single large wire to transport electricity make sense if anyone could please explain this for some non physics but electricly incline people would be very appreciated
109910 what is preventing and spin baryons from going to lower energy state with spin similar to that of protons and neutrons dont think the pauli exclusion principle can prevent it because the quarks have different colors the whole purpose of the quark color is to allow more than one quark to be in the same state whats so special about protons and neutrons what allows them to have lower energy compared to and
109964 understand that star is in plasma state all nucleus and electrons are not bound to each other and moving around freely photon is emitted when an excited electron moves back to lower orbit so in star if electrons are not in any orbit then how can photons be produced am sure some of my understanding above is incorrect please help me understand
109991 this paper hypothesizes that higgs bosons might be absolutely stable allowing them to serve as cold dark matter candidate the higgs boson is in the backbone of the standard model of electroweak interactions it must exist in some form for achieving unification of interactions in the gauge higgs unification scenario the higgs boson becomes part of the extra dimensional component of gauge fields the higgs boson becomes absolutely stable in class of the gauge higgs unification models serving as promising candidate for cold dark matter in the universe the observed relic abundance of cold dark matter is obtained with the higgs mass around gev the higgs nucleon scattering cross section is found to be close to the recent cdms ii and xenon10 bounds in the direct detection of dark matter in collider experiments stable higgs bosons are produced in pair appearing as missing energies and momenta so that the way of detecting higgs bosons must be altered stable higgs bosons new candidate for cold dark matter yutaka hosotani has the hypothesis in the above article been proved what about wimps

110231 as stated in the heading is frac partial partial phiy phi deltax correct here denotes phix denotes scalar field and if yes why any reference where can read about this would be great
110241 one of the suggested diagrams for the higgs production is the following so basically an electron positron pair annihilates and forms an excited boson which then decays into another less excited boson and higgs boson why cant the electron positron pair decay directly into higgs boson charge and lepton number would be conserved anyway and if the pair has enough energy to produce the boson in the first place it should have enough energy to produce the higgs boson
110546 for example the lagrangian formulation may be missing something not having done it in enough detail but here is my issue from the definition of the lagrangian mathcal and from the principle of least action st we get that st int mathcal dt has to be minimised from this one can derive the euler lagrange equation frac dt left frac partial partial dot right frac partial partial and using mathcal dot vx we get ddot vx newtons second law of motion now does the fact that we get newtons second law mean that the lagrangian formulation and therefore the principle of least action is correct mean could it not be coincidence that we get this equation but then again is there way that this equation could not hold the only difference between systems is the potential vx right so as long as it is included in general form the equation should hold in light of this is there any physical meaning as to why the lagrangian is defined as the difference between kinetic and potential energy mathcal
110645 have read the explanation for this in several textbooks but am struggling to understand it via archimedes principle if someone can clarify with diagram or something so can understand or clear equation explanation that would be great
110669 is gravitational time dilation caused by gravity or is it an effect of the inertial force caused by gravity is gravitational time dilation fundamentally different from time dilation due to acceleration are they the same but examples of different configurations could you recreate the same kind of time dilation without gravity using centrifugal force
110703 total noob here realize that photons do not have mass however they must somehow occupy space as ive read that light waves can collide with one another do photons occupy space and if so does that mean there is theoretically maximum brightness in which no additional amount of photons could be present in the same volume
110739 ive heard that in classical and quantum mechanics the law of conservation of information holds always wonder where my deleted files and folders have gone on my computer it must be somewhere think can anyone in principle recover it even if have overwritten my hard drive
110747 this seems natural but cant wrap my head around it when think about it when squeeze an open bottle filled with water the water will spill out when squeeze bottle the material collapses where squeeze it but expands in other areas resulting in constant volume if the volume is constant then would think that the water shouldnt spill out if were to guess there is something related to the pressure my hand is creating inside the bottle but im not entirely sure
110763 want to learn some qft in curved spacetime what papers books reviews can you suggest to learn this area are there any good books or other reference material which can help in learning about qft in curved spacetime there is no restriction about the material no matter physical or mathematical
110810 from the question why is the absolute zero understood that is the 100th part of the difference of melting and boiling temperature of water this is my high school physics maybe there is more accurate definition so we linked the value of to physical quantity then we measure another physical quantity the absolute zero and it turns out this is exactly less the melting temperature of water so how come those two quantities have rational ratio if we look at other constants gravitational planck or whatever they all are irrational arent they what did miss is it because the melting point of water is not exactly maybe something really close to like
110820 have you ever notice the sunsets image in the sea its like long light path to the end of the horizon ive attached sample of this how can we explain this know that it can happen even in wave less sea or lake why is this path so continuous expected that sea should act like mirror

110870 in chapter the primary neal stephenson has one of his character describe how the drives of computer carried through door by the police who where raiding the facility will have been erased basically theres an enormous electromagnet around the door frame cantrell is now drawing an elaborate diagram and has even slowed down almost to stop the better to draw it it begins with tall rectangle set within that is parallelogram the same size but skewed little bit downwards and with little circle drawn in the middle of one edge randy realizes he looking at perspective view of door frame with its door hanging slightly ajar the little circle being its knob steel frame cantrell writes hollow metal channels quick meandering scribbles suggest the matrix of wall surrounding it and the floor underneath where the uprights of the doorframe are planted in the floor cantrell draws small carefully foreshortened circles holes in the floor then he encircles the doorframe in continuous hoop beginning at one of those circles and climbing up one side of the doorframe across the top down the other side through the other hole in the floor and then horizontally beneath the door then up through the first hole again completing the loop he draws one or two careful iterations of this and then numerous sloppy ones until the whole thing is surrounded in vague elongated tornado many turns of fine wire finally he draws two leads away from this huge door sized coil and connects them to sandwich of alternating long and short horizontal lines which randy recognizes as the symbol for battery the diagram is completed with huge arrow drawn vigorously through the center of the doorway like an airborne battering ram labeled which means magnetic field ordo computer room door wow randy says cantrell has drawn classic elementary school electromagnet the kind of thing young randy made by winding wire around nail and hooking it up to lantern battery except that this one is wound around the outside of doorframe and randy guesses hidden inside the walls and beneath the floor so that no one would know it was there unless they tore the building apart magnetic fields are the styli of the modern world they are what writes bits onto disks or wipes them away the read write heads of tombstone hard drive are exactly the same thing but lot smaller if they are fine pointed draftsman pens then what cantrell drawn here is firehose spraying india ink it probably would have no effect on disk drive that was few meters away from it but anything that was actually carried through that doorway would be wiped clean between the pulse gun fired into the building from outside destroying every chip within range and this doorframe hack losing every bit on every disk the ordo raid must have been purely scrap hauling run for whoever organized it andrew loeb or according to the secret admirers attorney general comstock sinister fed forces who were using andy as cat paw the only thing that would have made it through that doorway intact would have been information stored on cd rom or other nonmagnetic media and tombstone had none of that would this actually work
110960 as you know there is maximum speed things can go called the speed of light light in vacuum goes light in the atmosphere however goes little less than my question is what effect does wind have on lights velocity simply adding the winds velocity to lights would not even be remotely close since mph tail wind would probably push it over
110994 this is what my textbook says about the michelson morley experiment this invariance of the speed of light between inertial reference frames means that there must be some relativity principle that applies to electromagnetism as well as to mechanics that principle cannot be newtonian relativity which implies the dependence of the speed of light on the relative motion of the source and observer question why must there be relativity principle that applies to electromagnetism and to mechanics why cant they be separate
111006 when close one eye and put the tip of my finger near my open eye it seems as if the light from the background image bends around my finger slightly warping the image near the edges of my blurry finger tip what causes this is it the heat from my finger that bends the light or the minuscule gravity that the mass in my finger exerts dont think so is this some kind of diffraction to reproduce put your finger about cm from your open eye look through the fuzzy edge of your finger and focus at something farther away move your finger gradually through your view and youll see the background image shift as your finger moves for all the people asking made another photo this time the backdrop is grid have on my screen due to lack of grid paper you see the grid deform ever so slightly near the top of my finger heres the setup note that these distances are arbitrary it worked just as well with my finger closer to the camera but this happens to be the situation that measured here are some photos of the side of mm thick flat opaque plastic object at different aperture sizes especially notice hoe the grid fails to line up in the bottom two photos
111017 it can be proved that the size of an initial volume element in phase space remain constant in time even for time dependent hamiltonians so was wondering whether it is still true even when the system is dissipative like damped harmonic oscillator

111427 if it is true that an electron can be anywhere in the cosmos at any given time then is it even theoretically possible that there is only one electron instead of multiple electrons in the cosmos if it isnt id appreciate it if someone could point out where may have misunderstood something as far as the fundamental properties of electrons are concerned
111449 according to this article the theory of special relativity holds that if you were chasing stream of light at half the speed of light the lights speed relative to you would still be does this hold for any speed below for example if you were travelling behind photon at what would the photons speed relative to you be also if you were travelling at and were chasing particle at what would its speed relative to you be what is the equation that is used for this calculation
111538 learned in my undergraduate physics class that atoms have magnetic fields produced by the orbit of electrons and the spin of electrons understand how an orbit can induce magnetic field because charge moving in circle is the same as loop of current what do not understand is how spinning ball of charge can produce magnetic field can someone explain how spin works preferably in way can understand
111587 am reading http www feynmanlectures caltech edu html ch13 s4 in the beginning of equation in which mr feynman calculates the potential energy of an object outside spherical shell it says frac gm2 pi mu int limits dr the result of the integral should be frac gm2 pi mu biglr bigr is 2a and so frac gm4 pi mu frac gmm how does mr feynman know how to choose the limits of the integral if chose the limits from to would get in the end frac gmm the only difference is the algebraic sign at the beginning dont know why you have to choose the beginning of the integral further away from and end closer to is there any rule that states that or why did mr feynman choose the limits of the integral the way he did did he think ive got to get negative result so choose the limits from to
111597 have great trouble in understanding simultaneity in special relativity let me illustrate it with concrete example assuming there is train its two end points are and the length of the train is the train moves at speed assuming the train is moving in the direction from to for ground observer observing the train movement he notices that two lightnings strike simultaneously at and when the middle part of the train passes through right in front of him in other words the ground observer is located at the middle part of the train when the lightnings strike simultaneously at and now there is another moving observer sitting inside the train and he sits right in the middle of the train equidistant from and does this moving observer think that the lighting happens at the same time if no how much time has passed before he notices lightning at after he had observed lightning at
111644 if you turn on fan in warm room it feels as if cold air is being pushed from the fan out in the direction that its facing but whats actually happening on molecular level when an object is heated its molecules are excited and they can in turn excite other molecules around them thereby passing on heat through the air or another medium but the opposite of this molecules vibrating less and passing on lack of vibration doesnt seem to make as much sense intuitively at least so is the apparent effect of cold air being pushed out by fan or air conditioner caused by molecules passing on their relative lack of movement to their neighbours or is there something else going on
111652 can we divide two vector quantities for eg pressure scalar equals force vector divided by area vector
111679 according to our current understanding the universe is expanding it is often said that every galaxy is moving away from us im assuming that isnt true for galaxies in our local group and its also often said that the farther galaxy is away from us the faster it moves away from us we also know that light has finite speed so when we look at those far away galaxies we see them as they were long long time ago but if the oldest galaxies are moving away faster and the younger galaxies are moving away slower then wouldnt that mean that the expansion of the universe is slowing down but when im thinking of an expanding 2d sheet of paper with dots scaled up in both directions then it makes sense that the farther galaxies would move faster away from our perspective although if the universe were expanding at constant rate we would still see the farther galaxies moving faster from our perspective but im assuming that it has been accounted for and that the galaxies move even faster than that so why is my first but incorrect something tells me that im looking at it at the wrong way but cant figure it out xd thanks
111761 it is written everywhere that gravity is curvature of spacetime caused by the mass of the objects or something to the same effect this raises question with me why isnt spacetime curved due to other forces or aspects of bodies why isnt it that there are curvatures related to the charge of body or the spin of particles or any other characteristics
111770 unlike the excellent wikipedia page on ultrasound imaging the one on mri only explains the principle theory behind mri that oscillating strong magnetic fields cause water molecules to emit radiowaves without explaining how his is applied to build detailed 3d image so how do we get from the billions of excited hydrogen atoms spitting radio waves presumably in all directions to building up 3d image and what precisely does each 3d pixel record little background for those interested want to be able to perform virtual mri of computer modelled patient for ray and ultrasound have enough understanding to do this but for mri dont

111955 the oil vinegar and other liquids in homemade salad dressing separate into layers after sitting for while making the mixture become more organized as time evolves why doesnt this violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics assume that the answer is that since the separation is due to gravity the effect is due to an external force and so the system isnt closed which is necessary for the 2nd law but im not sure if thats the answer then what happens if consider the whole system include the salad dressing gravitational field and whatever mass is generating the gravitational field the entropy of the salad dressing seems to decrease and so the entropy of some other component of this system must be increasing but its hard to see what this other component would be
112096 we know that meter is the distance travelled by light in vacuum within time interval of second my question is why we didnt take simpler number like or why not just
112097 intro it seems to me that the si units we use today are nothing but the result of historical coincidence recently began researching about natural absolute systems of units which are defined in such way that selected universal physical constants are normalized to unity these are very convenient since almost all equations in physics are simplified planck units take for example the planck units where five fundamental physical constants take on the numerical value of to quote from wikipedia planck units have profound significance since they elegantly simplify several recurring algebraic expressions of physical law by nondimensionalization they are particularly relevant in research on unified theories planck units are even dubbed gods units since planck units are free of anthropocentric arbitrariness justification know that many everyday quantities for physicist in terms of planck units would be very small numbers for instance but that shouldnt be problem if we use scientific notation in fact its great thing since it can give us better picture about those quantities being now in unit system which is conceptually linked at fundamental physical level besides many such everyday quantities are also expressed by very small very large numbers in si units think plancks constant frank wilczek even argues that using planck units would help us re frame important questions in physics we see that the question is not why is gravity so feeble but rather why is the protons mass so small for in planck units the strength of gravity simply is what it is primary quantity while the protons mass is the tiny number quintillion ai am aware that it would be big upheaval if we are to change our si units but if it is to be done it better be done right now before more physicists grow up using the old unit system the change is not likely to render old written material useless since for instance newtons principia mathematica remains fundamental text in mechanics even though it uses outdated notions such as quantity of motion and quantity of matter question given all that explained is there reason we choose to stick with the old and weary unit system why didnt we leave the kilogram defined by an arbitrary french rod to ladies gossiping about kim kardashians weight and choose something that makes more sense scientifically
112118 if im sitting in the den with my door slightly cracked can hear my wife washing dishes in the kitchen down the hall but why cant also see images of her washing dishes if say looked up on my wall broken down sound waves bounce off things light waves bounce off things you can hear sound of someone washing dishes in the next room why dont you cant see the light visuals from them
112190 am complete noob so please bear with me always read that in quantum world things exists as probability and only become one when they are observed or wave collapses into particle but there was one recent experiment in which scientists observed the wave and it still showed interference pattern so observing simply didnt collapse it side note it makes no sense that quantum world should be able to distinguish that its being observed by human or whether sensor alone
112249 if temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy per particle and heat energy is defined as the total kinetic energy of all the particles or more strictly heat transferred is the total kinetic energy transferred to those particles surely we can get heat by just multiplying temperature by the number of particles if so shouldnt molar heat capacity be constant across all substances im fairly sure im missing something that should be obvious here
112343 the simplest equation expressing mass energy equivalence is the famous mc where represents the speed of light compare this with frac mv since mc can be applied to rest mass and rest energy to show their proportionality as 0c ask whether this resemblance is just coincidence created by the need of any equation to be homogeneous for units or are the two equations fundamentally related know about mass energy equivalency but could not find the answer im looking for there
112354 one of the possible ways to simulate gravity in outer space is to have rotating spaceship so that the centrifugal force experienced provides gravity like force my question is shouldnt this only work when our feet are touching the floor of the spaceship only in that case the floor is providing contact force to balance the centrifugal force if we jumped there is no gravity within the spacecraft so what is it that would make us come back down also imagine we had shower what would make the water fall down

112483 electrons have much bigger charge density as the protons and especially lead nuclei arent compound particles as the protons and especially lead nuclei are able to get much bigger energy with the same fields as the protons and especially the lead nuclei why seems common for the big colliders after the lep to use protons and much bigger nuclei reacting comments yes to get good experimental data about quark matter they need lot of hot quarks collided big nuclei but to create new particles the energy per degree of freedom needs to be maximized and this maximum is at the single particle with the highest charge density and this is the electron
112615 ive heard this in many quantum mechanics talks and lectures nevertheless dont seem to grasp the idea behind it what mean is at which point is that our modern understanding of quantum mechanics led to technological development so fundamental for todays computers that we could not have got it working other way why is it not enough with maxwell bohr lorentz li nard

112866 photons have no mass but they can push things as evidenced by laser propulsion can photons push the source which is emitting them if yes will more intense flashlight accelerate me more does the wavelength of the light matter is this practical for space propulsion doesnt it defy the law of momentum conservation note as john rennie mentioned all in all the wavelength doesnt matter but for more accurate answer regarding that see the comments in davephds answer related wikipedia articles ion thruster space propulsion
112949 in mechanics our professor made the declaration that all laws of physics have been disproven he mentioned several examples including the law of gravity mentioning briefly that it is better explained by einsteins theory of general relativity he also mentioned bohrs model of the electron and how it was better explained by other models which ive since learned now haven taken modern physics as part of physics class im still scratching my head wondering how the theory of general relativity explains attraction between large objects has has einsteins theory of general relativity truly explained it or did misunderstand if so how
112959 why is it that many of the most important physical equations dont have ugly numbers arbitrary irrational factors to line up both sides why can so many equations be expressed so neatly with small natural numbers while recycling relatively small set of physical and mathematical constants for example why is mass energy equivalence describable by the equation mc and not something like approx times mc why is time dilation describable by something as neat as sqrt frac frac and not something ugly like approx times times sqrt frac frac and so forth im not well educated on matters of physics and so feel bit sheepish asking this likewise im not sure if this is more philosophical question or one that permits concrete answer or perhaps even the premise of the question itself is flawed so would gratefully consider anything that sheds light on the nature of the question itself as an answer edit just wished to give little more context as to where was coming from with this question based on some of the responses jerry schirmer comments you do have an ugly factor of times in front of everything you just hide the ugliness by calling this number these are not the types of ugly constants im talking about in that this number is the speed of light it is not just some constant needed to balance two side of an equation carl witthoft answers its all in how you define the units of course this is true we could in theory hide all sorts of ugly constants by using different units on the right and the left but as in the case of mc am talking about equations where the units on the left are consistent with the units on the right irrespective of the units used as mentioned on comment there mc could be defined using units like in imperial stones textsf in cubits fortnight textsf cf and in umm textsf sc textsf so long as the units are in the same system we still dont need fudge factor when the units are consistent in this manner theres no room for hiding fudge constants
113037 every piece of knowledge in science has beginning lying in someones experiment would like to know which experiment gave scientists the reason to believe nuclear fission fusion existed and was instrumental in the development of the field of nuclear energy would also accept thought experiment as an acceptable answer as long as it answers the question
113087 for example we have electric kettle with litter of water and we have another the same type electric kettle with litters of water how much time each kettle will need to boil and why how does the boiling time in electric kettle depend on the amount of water
113092 in mechanics problems especially one dimensional ones we talk about how particle goes in direction to minimize potential energy this is easy to see when we use cartesian coordinates for example frac du dx or in the multidimensional case the gradient so the force will go in the direction of minimizing the potential energy however it becomes less clear in other cases for example read problem that involved ball attached to pivot so it could only rotate it was then claimed that the ball would rotate towards minimal potential energy however frac du theta neq think in this case it might be equal to torque which would make their reasoning correct but it seems like regardless of the degrees of freedom of the problem it is always assumed that the forces act in way such that the potential energy is minimized could someone give good explanation for why this is edit should note that typed this in google and found this page where it states that minimizing potential energy and increasing heat increases entropy for one this isnt really an explanation because it doesnt state why it increases entropy also if possible would like an explanation that doesnt involve entropy but if it is impossible to make rigorous argument that doesnt involve entropy then using entropy is fine as side note how does this relate to hamiltons principle

113235 am currently working my way through john townsend book fundamental approach to modern physics isbn exercise is about the 1d infinite square well the box has the potential barriers at and leftx right begin cases infty leq leq infty end cases the text states the following particle of mass is in the lowest energy ground state of the infinite potential energy well at time the wall located at is suddenly pulled back to position at 2l this change occurs so rapidly that instantaneously the wave function does not change calculate the probability that measurement of the energy will yield the ground state energy of the new well the answer to this question involves re solving the applying new boundary conditions and re normalizing the wave function then we project the new wave function onto the old one and calculate the overlap of the two wave functions initial and final wave function cannot find any discussion about this particular problem that would make me able to reason my way to calculate an overlap between the initial and final wave function no way unless have background in linear algebra and would be able to foresee the need to project the one onto the other and sort of find my way logically to the answer see no way any student without any experience with quantum physics would be able to solve this on their own had to use google until found the solution to similar problem or maybe qm just does not come naturally to me lot of problem solving is required in these types of courses to for us to build up some intuition about what to expect as results what to do etc still do not fully understand the logic behind the solution to the problem phenomenologically there is particle inside the box then suddenly the box widens to twice its size however the wave function does not change even though the particle has bigger box in which to move around the initial wave function does not take this extra room into account and would equal zero when hence would not expect for the particle to venture out to the new region much if we used only the initial wave function or is the problem that the particle will indeed venture out there since vx and it is physically allowed to but we have not considered this in our normalizing of the function hence it makes no sense to calculate any property of the particle with the initial wave function since this is simply the incorrect wave function for the new well new ideas and thoughts okay so have to evaluate the integral int limits infty infty psi psi dx where psi is the theoretical wave function for particle in the entire box that is from to 2l and psi is the wave function for the actual particle that is from to now can split this integral into two parts int limits infty infty psi psi dx int limits psi psi dx int limits 2l psi psi dx we see that since the actual particles wave function is not defined when the second term will be zero that is the wave functino is normalized for and the boundary conditions ensures that psi rightarrow when and thus the the integral over is reduced to begin align int limits psi psi dx int limits sqrt frac sin left frac pi 2l right sqrt frac sin left frac pi right dx frac sqrt int limits sin left frac pi 2l right sin left frac pi right dx frac sqrt pi rightarrow frac pi approx end align think maybe my difficulty with visualzing the problem is that do not fully understand the expression for and how this gives the probability for measuring the energy level know this seems like am rambling and maybe am but hope you understand my confusion appreciate any help
113242 am an undergraduate student in physics have basic understanding of particle physics and quantum mechanics but none whatsoever of quantum field theory know that neutrino mixing requires neutrinos to be massive but why physically couldnt neutrinos mix if they were massless and that their mass is usually estimated to be lower than an upper threshold but mathematically does the standard model actually predict an upper limit on the neutrino mass or does it just say that they are massless in the former case what is it stopping it from predicting lower limit in the latter case so is it wrong
113294 what would we see during the day when we look into the sky other than clouds if it werent for rayleigh scattering making the sky blue would the sky be dark like at night
113321 lets say shine laser from stationary medium into moving medium suppose the water is moving very quickly perpendicular to the interface and back to stationary medium like this note left and right sides of the image are stationary mediums center is medium moving in the direction indicated by the arrow which of the above scenarios or im way off correctly reflects the path the light will take even if the translation is incredibly small edit to answer some good questions and things left out of the original question the center moving medium is water the left and right medium stationary is air the first angle of incidence on the left between the air and the water is perpendicular
113431 all found in google was very broad from physics models perspective why can photons emitted from laser cut does this cut mean that the photons are acting like matter
113643 the maxwell boltzmann velocity distribution arises from non reactive elastic collisions of particles and is usually discussed in the context of the kinetic theory for gases there are various offhand remarks for example here slide that state without reference that particles observe similar velocity distribution in liquid is that true references the main reason im curious is that it seems as though the mean free path would be extremely short in liquid vs gas im actually most curious about the nature of the collisions in liquid vs gas are collisions in liquid still on average elastic edit the linked post on particle velocity in liquids is definitely interesting and weighs in on this question and appreciate the distinction made between local position fluctuation vs long range movement still let me frame this question in few different ways gillespie proposed stochastic framework for simulating chemical reactions which is formulated on the idea that non reactive elastic collisions serve to uniformize particle position so that the assumption of well mixedness is always satisfied see page in the linked version this is formulated from kinetic theory corollary to this is that non reactive collision between two molecules that are able to react does not induce local correlation two particles able to react with each other that just collided but didnt react are no more likely to react with each other in the next dt than any other particle pair in the volume gillespies algorithm is commonly used in biology where biochemical species are modeled in the aqueous environment of cells is this valid and if so why on microscopic scale suppose we are interested in two particles diffusing in one dimension in an aqueous environment the two particles collide but dont react what is their behavior immediately after the collision is it reflection which conserves velocity and might correspond to neumann bc in gas that approach seems natural but in liquid the short mean free path makes me think that diffusive forces would rapidly dissipate any momentum from the collision which might imply the particles collide and stop how should be thinking about this just to bring it back to the original question think both and depend on the statistical velocity behavior of particles in liquid
113669 im studying quantum mechanics in its most basic level dont even know if physicists call this already quantum mechanics and have one doubt in schrodingers equation the book presents the equation for the special case where the solution is of the form psixt psixe omega and says that schrodingers equation in one dimension is dfrac psi dx dfrac pi ux psix where is the mass of the particle its total energy and its potential energy function the first doubt that arises is the following the book says that is the constant total energy of the particle but wait since and varies clearly should vary how can be constant if is not also when we write ux isnt this simply the kinectic energy why do we bother then writing explicitly feel that the potential ux on the equation and the one that is part of are different but im not understanding how
113677 is there ever situation where the distinction between frac dv dt and frac dp dt is important cant think of situation where one is true and not the other assuming only conservation of momentum edit obviously it is important to take changing mass into account for rocket when youre considering full time evolution ft mt frac dv dt or in the relativistic case perhaps something like ft mt frac dt left frac right with the rest mass and perhaps there is nontrivial relationship between the rate of change of mass and the forces being exerted again with rocket where the mass loss is tied to the propulsion what is not clear is that there should ever be frac dm dt term edit my understanding of the solution there should not be dm dt term as pointed out by garyp the change in momentum expression is however more accurate because neq mv in general in relativistic cases or when considering massless systems it would seem that either one must take the caveat that dp dt cannot be used for mass varying systems or take the much less conceptual or aesthetically pleasing expression that frac gamma dt which still only applies to classical systems
113749 for instance evidence that highly energetic laser beam attracts objects nearby in the framework of einsteins general relativity all energy curves spacetime and hence exerts an attraction but my question is whether it is an experimentally verified fact that energy that doesnt come from mass such as photons indeed attracts massive objects
113776 the title says it all is there table that sums up the parameters the assumptions symmetries and the most important predictions of the standard model
113818 understand that nothing can move faster than light due to time dilation want to build upon my understanding of einsteins theory of special relativity so came up with this hypothetical problem for myself if both particles are moving at 9c towards each other according to an observer on earth what speed does each particle have relative to the other im stumped since am only familiar with newtonian classical mechanics to solve this which would be wrong am aware of lorentz factor gamma frac sqrt frac and the time dilation equation frac sqrt frac but im not sure how to apply it in this instance im just looking for gentle push in the right direction edit my prior research this article https what if xkcd com talks about the effect of baseball thrown at 9c would have as it traveled towards batter this is not what im looking for since it doesnt explain the math behind finding the collision speed between two high velocity entities this question on yahoo https answers yahoo com question indexqid 20110529201519aaxbxvm asks similar question to mine but no math is involved to demonstrate the calculations behind the reasoning this question on physics se collision between photon and massive particle does not answer my question either have not been able to find similar physics se question which can provide me to clues to my own hypothetical question have also googled the following phrases collision faster than the speed of light ii collision of high speed particles iii lorentz transformation in collision iv collision analysis at light speed
114022 lets restrict to the case of spin system as we know spin liquid sl state is the ground state of lattice spin hamiltonian with no spontaneous broken symmetries sometime it may spontaneously break time reversal symmetry and is called chiral sl where two essential symmetries of sl state are lattice translation and spin rotation symmetries since traditionally we usually describe sl state by using spin hamiltonian with the full su2 spin rotation symmetry heisenberg model and the corresponding sl state is hence also su2 symmetric rvb type sl while the honeycomb kitaev model provides us an exact sl ground state with spin rotation symmetry where is finite subgroup of su2 indicating that the kitaev sl does not belong to the rvb type thus my question is generally speaking what is the minimal spin rotation symmetry required for spin hamiltonian to describe sl ground state is group the minimal one thank you very much my motivation for this question is that for spin hamiltonian without any spin rotation symmetry whether or not can it possess sl ground state and does the existence of sl state with some spin rotation symmetry imply the occurrence of emergent symmetries
114033 the tittle pretty much says enough have always been told so but no one really motivated it so would like to know why do we use tensor to describe the stresses in continuum mechanics
114069 introduction consider the em field there was time when the field was defined in similar manner to that of the gravitational field this changed when the view on gravitation evolved to this new idea which suggested it was consequence of space time curvature now consider the equivalence principle it was due to this principle that the view on gravitation was changed from that of classical field to one which suggested more geometric nature cannot help but think that we should of owed the same respect to the em field since it doesnt seem unreasonable to think that an some equivalence principle of some kind may be assigned em field if we may assign an equivalence principle to the em field then perhaps we can define the electromagnetic field in some geometric way as well understand and certainly agree that em energy stored in volume of space will contribute to the mass energy content in that volume and hence curvature but this is not what am talking about rather am considering the possibility of newer description of the em field which may complement the geometric description of the gravitational field in more explicit way consider gravity before it was described by einstein claim that one could derive an gravitational tensor in the same way as one can derive an electromagnetic tensor mu nu say this because gravity possesses gravito magnetic property this isnt surprising to me since magnetism is nothing more than relativistic effect of static fields what am trying to say is that before einstein one could in principle derive gravitational tensor which was analogous to the electromagnetic tensor yet after getting to this point it would still remain special relativistic compatible classical description of gravitational field meaning it doesnt necessarily take gravitational time dilation into account in this sense the electromagnetic tensor describes the em field classically of course this is not important anymore since we do have more powerful set of machinery for describing the gravitational field all this to me only suggests that the em field could be better described at the macroscopic scales conclusions the principle of equivalence made it possible to assign geometric description to the gravitational interaction if gravitational fields may be defined in geometric way then perhaps the em field can be as well if principle of equivalence may be defined for the em field questions is it impossible to assign an equivalence principle of some kind to the em field if not why if it is possible to assign an equivalence principle to the em field then what may be the first steps in constructing the em field in more geometric way where is my logic thought process flawed
114120 remember reading about an experiment where fine rods of tungsten were super heated with millions of amps of electricity melting them into ionised gas and were then compressed by magnetic fields into plasma the plasma heated up to temperatures never before reached cant remember exactly but believe it was few billion degrees fahrenheit it was number of years ago and cant find the report via search engine is there limit to the temperature of plasma whats the current highest recorded temperature of plasma is it hotter than nuclear reactions
114206 it seems from my weak understanding of the standard model that the only field suitable for long range communication is the one we actually use electromagnetism gravity waves could be used as well suppose but gravity is too weak to be practical use questions is this correct it seems so as you need boson to be able to produce intense signals and all the others are either unstable or strongly interacting gluon why is it like that is there some underlying fundamental reason that there are no other useful bosons does beyond the standard model physics provide any insight any potential alternatives graviphoton
114280 know roughly how turbine engine lets say gas turbine producing no jet thrust is supposed to work the compressor forces fresh air into combustion chamber where it reacts with fuel to become hot exhaust gas on its way out of the engine the exhaust gas drives turbine and the turbine both makes the compressor go and has enough leftover torque to do useful work however how do the exhaust gases know theyre supposed to push on the turbine blades to drive the shaft rather than push back on the compressor blades to retard the drive shaft in equal measure in piston engine there are valves that force things to flow in the correct direction at the right times but with the turbine engine everything is openly connected all the time shouldnt that mean that the pressure differential the compressor must work against is exactly the same as that which is available to drive the turbine something magical and irreversible seems to happen in the combustion chamber the descriptions can find that go deeper than the three step explanation above all seem to jump directly to very detailed model with lots of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics that make my head spin is there an idealized system with fewer variables that could think of to convince myself were not getting something for nothing here might the working fluid be incompressible or massless or have infinite heat capacity or whatever
114399 this question is somewhat of historical one but it also contains some physics am curious to find how exactly the concept of feynman diagrams arose assume from feynmans path integral the leap from path integrals to diagrammatic computations isnt obvious to me at least id like to understand better how feynmans thinking approximately developed for instance how did he come up with interpreting the propagator as the propagation of particles was there particular analogy that can be made is there any understanding to be gained by learning how the technique was originally developed realize that my phrasing might be quite vague if the question is too broad as of right now please let me know how can improve on it
114496 am currently wondering about the famous right hand rule for magnetic fields around currents where does it come from mathematically that when you point with your thumb in the direction of the current your curved fingers will point in the direction of the field in other words which mathematical operation does it come from probably it has to do with some vector product or stokes theorem application but am not quite sure about it
114503 according to this wikipedia article consequently most objects that absorb visible light reemit it as heat so although an object may appear dark it is likely bright at frequency that humans cannot perceive can someone explain this to me in lay mans terms does this mean that darkness is really light
114523 consider the scenario where you measure the time it takes for light to travel to the left meters and to the right meters both measurements will take the same time even though we are moving through space at crazy speeds this must mean that light is not moving relative to space as whole what does it move relative to the light emitter if so try shooting two beams of light meters from the wall the first time the emitter is stationary the second time it is moving at am mistaken in thinking that it would hit the wall slightly faster wouldnt this light be moving faster than the light emitted from the stationary source
114525 had left over coffee cup this morning and tried to wash it out realized always instinctively use hot water to clean things as it seems to work better google search showed that other people get similar results but this yahoo answer is bit confusing in terms of hot water exciting dirt what is the physical interaction between hot water and oil or material burnt onto another vs cold water interaction
114591 if hang rope from two points that are at the same height above the ground what is the mathematical function that describes the shape of the rope between the two points assuming the mass of the rope is evenly distributed between the two points upon visual inspection it appears to be parabolic but looks can be deceiving want to be able to calculate how much rope ill need to span the distance assuming that want it to sag by given amount if know the function of the ropes shape think can use an integral to calculate the length of the curve
114669 newtons third law states that every force has an equal and opposite reaction but this doesnt seem like the case in the following scenario for example person punches wall and the wall breaks the wall wasnt able to withstand the force nor provide equal force in opposite direction to stop the punch if the force was indeed equal wouldnt the punch not break the wall like punching concrete youll just hurt your hand doesnt this mean newtons third law is wrong in these cases
114785 in relativity if two events are simultaneous in specified frame they cannot be simultaneous in any other frame my question is this given any two events is there always frame in which these two events are simultaneous for example if drop blue ball on one side of tennis court and my friend drops red ball on the opposite side of the court one day later from my frame one day later is there frame in which the blue and red balls hit the ground simultaneously
114958 the space time interval equation is this delta delta delta delta delta where delta delta delta and delta represent the distances along various coordinates according to an observer and delta is the space time interval all observers agree on the space time interval it is constant my question is why is it squared if we had in equation like this delta delta delta delta delta delta would be constant as well it would also never be imaginary it would have units of length instead of length though is there theoretical or practical reason that we define the space time interval based on squaring or is it just to make it look similar to pythagoras theorem give it simpler units or something else entirely
114994 as understand an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light because its relativistic mass increases exponentially as it approaches light speed so there is relation between mass and speed but if speed is relative measurement it depends on point of reference how does that affect the mass is the mass also relative to point of reference or is there some absolute speed wrt some fixed point which affects the mass of an object follow up what have trouble to understand is given these two facts hope got the facts right light always moves at the same speed independently of the inertial frame of reference the speed of mass object is relative to frame of reference then if an object is moving at of light speed for given observer what will different observer see will that other observer see the object moving at different percentage of light speed assuming the observers are moving at different speeds of course
115070 lorentz length contractions states that the length of any moving object gets divided by the lorentz factor equal to the lorentz factor for that object always geq equal to gamma frac sqrt frac however in massless particles so the lorentz factor becomes infty meaning that an object traveling at will have length however photons and obviously all forms of electromagnetic waves move at when traveling through vacuum such as from space shuttle to space station or back to earth does this mean that photons have no length how does this affect wavelength
115088 have to fit some data to power law alpha beta being and the experimental data points what usually do is taking logs so that lnf beta lnq ln alpha and apply least squares with uncertainties in both variables how may approach this in the case that some of the values of and eventually are negative if it helps beta should be compatible with value of but want general approach edit the law to be fitted is coulombs law is the force between to charged spheres one of them has fixed charge the other is variable we call the proportionality constant alpha is related to varepsilon with known expression in powers of beta frac where is the distance between the centers of the spheres and is their radius so want to determine from experiment both alpha and beta and compare them with varepsilon and the actual values are begin array hline mathrm nc mathrm mn hline pm hline pm hline pm hline pm hline pm hline pm hline pm hline end array with the uncertainty in the last decimal place for the forces
115188 have read multiple answers on stackexchange about this question but wasnt able to find concrete answer like other questions the reason ask about the orbital is because it has zero orbital angular momentum but the implication of having zero angular momentum is unclear some answers discuss probability distributions but the question is how can there be multiple places for an electron if it cant move read another answer that says that the electron passes through the nucleus or curve around it as wave would appreciate it if anyone could provide resolution to this question
116281 folks have naive question regarding the subject of dark energy and an accelerating universe from what understand read it seems that the further we look out into deep space the faster the objects are moving away from us in all directions is this basically what is meant by accelerating universe because it seems that this situation is exactly what we should expect to see according to big bang theory the further out we peer into space the further back in time we are seeing so wouldnt we expect to see higher rates of acceleration expansion the further back in time we peer
116290 im an electrical engineer and understand wave propagation interference patterns and so on but im missing something basic so perhaps my understanding isnt as good as believe ill show my thinking please tell me where am mistaken say that have two guitars each one is precisely tuned each guitar has somebody play an open string note the result is louder note which implies to me constructive interference but if this is true why is there never destructive noise cancelling effect obviously both guitar strings arent always going to vibrate in the same phase
116302 spent some time studying about temperatures and color of objects it turns out that as we heat something it turns to red then yellowish white and if we heat it more it turns to bluish white like we can say blue star is hotter than red star but why isnt it the same with flames blue flame isnt always hotter than red flame its just the chemistry of it all mean know the electrons jump from one orbit to another and gets into excited state when heated but the questions in my mind are if one object appears blue and another red that doesnt always mean that the blue object is hotter than red is that correct if yes then how is it so am sorry but im bit confused over it with the color temperature concept on wikipedia they say to match flame but for clear blue poleward sky this confuses me the sky appears blue does that mean its hot but it isnt right its colder am not sure if im able to frame it properly its bit confusing to me is this something like glowing object vs reflecting object the sun is white but earth is blue but sun is hotter than the earth its the sun radiating light but earth is just scattering it but the surface temperature of sun is 5778k while the wikipedia states our sky is about 15000k know theres something im missing here im hoping someone can tell me what is it
116430 in this question am talking about the following situation now know that the max kinetic energy of the electrons emitted is ke max nu phi em where phi em is the work function of the emitter electrode on the left in the diagram and my lecturer agrees with that but he tells us that the stopping potential can be found using ev nu phi col where phi col is the work function of the collector electrode on the right in the diagram the emitter and collector electrodes are made from different metals what dont understand is why the stopping potential doesnt depend on the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons edit have attached the slide from the lecture course
116452 have two questions on mirrors ve read that in the past quality mirrors were coated with silver but that today vacuum evaporated coatings of aluminum are the accepted standard when look at the reflectance vs wavelength plot see that silver has higher reflectance than aluminum so why use aluminum instead of silver if one wants the highest quality mirrors assume that cost is secondary so what is the physics that am missing here why are the more technical mirrors am not sure what this means but assume more precise front surfaced instead of back surfaced
116499 im trying to understand how people actually measure decay constants that are discussed in meson decays as concrete example lets consider the pion decay constant the amplitude for pi decay is given by begin equation big langle exp big int 4x cal big pi pi big rangle end equation to lowest order this is given by begin equation int 4x left langle mu mu pi pi right rangle end equation if we square this quantity and integrate over phase space then we will get the decay rate on the other hand the pion decay constant is defined through begin equation left langle mu pi right rangle pi pi mu end equation this is clearly related to the above but it seems to me there are couple of subtleties in particular how do we get rid of the time ordering symbol since we dont have value for mu how can we go ahead and extract pi
116595 why is the application of probability in quantum mechanics qm fundamentally different from its application in other areas qm applies probability according to the same probability axioms as in other areas of physics engineering etc why is there difference naively one would assume one of these possibilities it is not the same probability theory it is matter of interpretation of the formalism something else many answers which am still studying focus on the fact that the combined probability of two mutually exclusive events in qm is not equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event which holds classically by definition this fact appears to makes the formulation of another probability quantum one necessity yet this again breaks down to assumed independent if this is not so the classic probability is applicable as indeed in other areas this is one of the main points of the question
116608 the electromagnetic force and strong and weak forces require particles like photons and gluons but in case of gravity there is no such particle found every mass bearing object creates gravitational field around it and whenever another mass bearing object enters its field the gravitational force comes into operation if all other forces of nature have some particles associated with them why should gravity be an exception and if there is no such particle what exactly is the gravitational field and how does it spread over an infinite distance and cause the gravitational force to operate note am high school student and have not studied quantum mechanics
116757 in history there was an attempt to reach by replacing ct with ict still employed today in form of the wick rotation wick rotation supposes that time is imaginary wonder if there is another way without need to have recourse to imaginary numbers minkowski spacetime is based on the signature in minkowski diagram we get the equation delta delta tau tau being the invariant spacetime interval or the proper time by replacing time with proper time on the axis of the minkowski diagram the equation would be delta tau delta in my new diagram this equation would describe right angled triangle and the signature of proper time space space space would be am aware of the fact that the signature is necessary for the majority of physical calculations and applications especially lorentz transforms and thus the signature would absolutely not be practicable edit in contrast to some authors on the website about euclidian spacetime mentioned in alemi comment below but wonder if there are some few physical calculations applications where this signature is useful in physics especially when studying the nature of time and of proper time edit drawing added both diagrams time space and proper time space are observers views even if as it has been pointed out by john rennie dt is frame dependent and is not

116960 how much energy in form of heat does human body emit at rest level
117013 know that virtual photons are known to be the force carriers for the electromagnetic force and that they are called virtual because the energy time inequality version of the heisenberg uncertainty principle allows for particles that are high enough energy that they are very difficult to observe because higher energy means smaller possible time scale for observation but also know that photons are the quanta of em radiation they emitted from atoms at some point in space and absorbed at other points in space as means of transmitting radiation energy my question is this are the photons that act as the force carrier of the electromagnetic force the same photons the exact same particle as the photons that act as the quanta of em radiation is it just that the photons emitted as virtual particles have high enough energy that they act as force carrier if so what causes charged particles to emit photons of such high energy ii as an add on question im being introduced loosely to electro weak unification and the idea that at high enough energy the em and weak forces become indistinguishable from one another and believe that the difference between the em force and the weak force at low energy is that the and bosons that mediate the weak force are massive and therefor act at low range whereas photons are massless and therefor act at long ranges and subsequently that the higgs boson helps to explain what gives and bosons mass but what is the difference between the and bosons and the photon that makes them interact with the higgs mechanism and the photon remain unaffected hope these questions make sense

117102 we all know that in an idealised world all objects accelerate at the same rate when dropped regardless of their mass we also know that in reality or more accurately in air lead feather falls much faster than ducks feather with exactly the same dimensions structure etc loose explanation is that the increased mass of the lead feather somehow defeats the air resistance more effectively than the ducks feather is there more formal mathematical explanation for why one falls faster than the other

117354 the annihilation and creation operators are given below hat rangle sqrt rangle qquad text and qquad hat dagger rangle sqrt rangle now know the operator dagger is not hermitian but as to why im little confused is it because they create and annihilate photons hence theyre not hermitian dont think that explanation would be good for an exam if this question was asked though
117369 imagine this you have some object let say barrel and fill it with water the water remains rather calm so it doesnt spills out then we take balloon filled with air and push it in that tank what will happen when release the balloon which side it will go if its in the middle will it direct to the open area of the barrel or to the bottom same goes if somehow we form perfect sphere of water and put the balloon inside of it where it will be pushed
118570 continuous fourier transform vs discrete fourier transform can anyone tell me what the difference is physics wise know the mathematical way to do both but when do you use the other instead of the other is the dfs not as accurate since it relies on discrete values or has it nothing to do with that or is it just because its easier to do with fft
118629 so mindlessly wandering off into space thinking about quantum and how cool physics is came to realization that well negative numbers to me make sense you have either something or not something its always yes or no answer with everything and everything always has an opposite its nonexistence either have red scarf or not if there are doors labeled have to choose one of them the choice isnt me choosing which door the choice is what door ill pick ill either pick door or not pick door the opposite of door is no door lets go really small have grains of salt cant take grains away believe negative numbers were invented by man to create debt because it doesnt make any sense in physics can someone please explain this to me

119103 we have all learned that the earth is getting heat up because of the co2 and co molecules absorbing heat however how is heat actually kept in those molecules when photons heat them up their electron gets excited and goes to higher energy level however we know that atoms want to remain at low energy state and they quickly drop down to lower energy state correct me if am wrong here if that is happening then how can heat be actually kept in carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide molecule is it because during the day they get heat up and remain heated because they require more time to get to lower energy state note this is not duplicate to the question given as duplicate because the other question was addressed at why is one element able to absorb heat and not the others this question on the other hand is focused towards how any element is able to absorb heat at all
119126 my question basically is is kronecker delta delta ij or delta many tensor calculus books including the one which use state it to be the latter whereas have also read many instances where they use the former they cannot be the same as the dont have the same transformation laws what think is that since delta delta but delta ij doesnt so the latter cannot be tensor but the problem is that both have the same value depending upon the indices so it makes me think that delta ij is just the identity matrix and not tensor and delta is function but since delta also has the same output as delta ij what is the difference think it could be matrix representations in general is there difference between matrix representations of delta ij delta ij and delta or any other tensor for that matter please answer these the difference between mixed indices and matrix representations
119254 wikipedia lists the graviton as hypothetical particle wonder whether graviton is indeed hypothetical or does its existence directly follow from modern physics does observation of gravitational waves amount to the discovery of graviton or could there be gravitational waves not composed of gravitons
119387 from the second law of thermodynamics the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases because isolated systems always evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium state with maximum entropy now understand why the entropy cant decrease but fail to understand why the entropy tends to increase as the system reach the thermodynamic equilibrium since an isolated system cant exchange work and heat with the external environment and the entropy of system is the difference of heat divided for the temperature since the total heat of system will always be the same for it doesnt receive heat from the external environment its natural for me to think that difference of entropy for an isolated system is always zero could someone explain me why am wrong ps there are many questions with similar title but theyre not asking the same thing
119593 the question concerns this video it says that the gravitational lens effect is an illusion meaning its not caused by gravity but by change in density of plasma atmosphere it claims further that this gravitational lens effect is not present with other massive objects that arent made of or surrounded by plasma does this mean general relativity is invalid somewhat invalid or still luckily valid what is the merit of claim that bending could be caused by plasma and not by gravity
119636 our class is learning about hydrostatic water pressure and we have been told that we can calculate the force of the liquid on an object at any depth using the density the depth however as the depth increases wouldnt the density of the liquid increase because of the weight of the liquid above it compressing it so shouldt there be something in the equation to account for the varying density to me density depth seems like it is saying that the density will be constant
119688 apologize for this elementary question dont know much about physics lets say that put metal pot in the refrigerator for several hours at this point guess the pot and the air in the refrigerator have the same temperature now touch this pot it feels very cold but when touch the air that is inside the fridge it doesnt feel as cold dont feel the same ouch that feel when touch the pot why is that why does the metal seem colder than air although they both have the same temperature know that gas has less particles in it in one unit of volume compared to solids and liquids but since temperature means the average kinetic energy these fewer air particles are supposed to hit my hand in velocity thats going to compensate for their lower number arent they related question for clarification if use thermometer to measure the temperature of the pot air lets assume its thermometer that has probe that can touch objects will it show the same reading for both if so what makes the thermometer different than my hand mean my hand is sort of thermometer so why would it fail whereas non human thermometer would work
119732 according to the wikipedia page on the electron the electron has no known substructure hence it is defined or assumed to be point particle with point charge and no spatial extent does point particle mean the particle should not have shape surface area or volume but when searched google for the electron shape got many results like this and this that says electrons are round in shape
119838 what is the correspondence between the conserved canonical energy momentum tensor which is mu nu can sum frac delta mathcal matter delta partial mu partial nu eta mu nu mathcal the four conserved noether currents corresponding to four possible spacetime translations where are the matter fields in the theory and we assume mapsto alpha nu partial nu for translations and stress energy tensor from the einstein hilbert action which is mu nu equiv frac sqrt frac delta mathcal matter delta mu nu in particular how do you get that the two are equal are they for minkowski space for which there is no variation in the metric
119858 was recently shown pretty cool video about common cosmological misconceptions it got me reviewing the different between event horizon current distance within which we will see interact particle horizon current distance within which we have seen interacted and the hubble sphere distance at which things are currently receding at the speed of light ive found the following figure extremely helpful but im very confused about the event horizon currently lying outside of the hubble sphere if the universe is accelerating in its expansion then it seems like everything outside of the hubble sphere at this moment will never be in causal contact never be within our light cone and thus be outside of our event horizon is this figure correct

120015 have question regarding the effect of quantum mechanical operators the definition that im familiar with says that an operator acts on vector from hilbert space psi rangle and the result is another vector psi rangle psi rangle psi rangle however in class ive also seen operators applied to scalar valued functions such as the momentum operator in position space hbar frac partial partial quad psix hbar frac partial partial psix however mathematically that doesnt make sense to me since should operate on vector not scalar function know that wave functions can be viewed as the coefficients of state vector when the vector is written in particular basis such as psi rangle int infty infty rangle langle mathrm psi rangle int infty infty rangle langle psi rangle mathrm int infty infty psix rangle mathrm with psix langle psi rangle but as far as can tell the operator should still act on vector not on function alone on the wikipedia article operator physics under linear operators in wave mechanics found the following psix langle psi rangle langle psi rangle however that last step seems dubious to me is it valid to just swap the operator into the inner product like that in general dont see the mathematical meaning of expressions like psix or langle since can neither act on scalar value nor on bra does it only work for self adjoint operators since wed then have dagger which might help with acting on bras

121299 just got myself an infrared thermometer wouldnt have been able to predict what temperature it would give me when pointing at the sky but it turned out to be the first time measured and slightly going up and down with the temperature on the ground say from to in the course of day in which the ground temperature goes from at night to during daytime some details this was for pointing straight up as long as its not pointing too closely to the sun clear sky and humidity of according to internet the range in which it measures radiation is from and the specified range of temperatures is to what is it that causes this reading
121337 the density matrix hat rho is often introduced in textbooks as mathematical convenience that allows us to describe quantum systems in which there is some level of missing information hat rho sum rvert psi rangle langle psi rvert have two questions regarding density matrices first it is clear that generic pure state rvert psi rangle belongs to some hilbert space mathcal but what mathematical space do density matrices belong to it is clear that the expression hat rho in mathcal is incorrect as mixed state cannot possibly be described in terms of state in hilbert space can we think of the space of all possible density matrices of given dimension as metric space does this space have the topological properties of manifold secondly can the density matrix be considered physical for example if we take single photon described in the fock basis neglecting polarization can the fundamental description of that photon ever be the completely mixed state frac rvert rangle langle rvert rvert rangle langle rvert or is this only reflection of some ignorance on the part of the experimentalist and in reality the photon must be described by pure state

121406 first of all am sorry if this is stupid question but ive heard that atoms interact with each other at the speed of sound when you for instance push chair the atoms collide with each other in chain reaction at the speed of sound making the chair move how can then airplanes fly faster than the speed of sound without something going crazy
121451 at what pressure will be particles in medium be unable to form sound wave when disturbed how can this pressure be described mathematically my guess is that this would correspond to the point at which the restoring force due to pressure is unable to create transverse wave and the disturbed particles travel infinitely far away before the hypothetical wave reaches its amplitude but have no idea how you would even begin to start finding quantitative value for this point

121551 recently ish stumbled across an interesting short story by way of science fiction fantasy stack exchange where soccer referee is apparently incinerated by concentrated sunlight where the referee had been standing there was small smoldering heap from which thin column of smoke curled up into the still air this is accomplished in story by some reflective tinfoil program covers each about the size of tabloid sheet what got me interested physics is one of my peripheral interests is the feasibility of this method in the real world wikipedia says tabloid sheet is mathrm mm cdot mathrm mm mathrm mm approx mathrm giving fifty thousand people with program each total of mathrm to work with adjusting for less than perfect aim id say closer to about mathrm if you could redirect that much sunlight at about persons surface area how much power would that be what damage could you cause he couldnt have felt much it was as if he had been dropped into blast furnace could that amount of power actually incinerate someone it occurs to me that the wikipedia summary of the story quoted on scifi se states only that the referee collapsed and died if incineration isnt possible could the energy involved still be lethal by other means
121724 the representation of the experiment which demonstrates that white light consists of many colors invariably shows that the beam of white light is broadened inside the prism and is some what more broadened when it exits in the form of the separated colors am not able to figure out if this broadening of the beam will occur in the case of strictly monochromatic light for more complete background the following is what am trying to achieve have laser pointer out of which am trying to get sheet of laser for this am exploring the use of prisms one or more prisms using this beam plan to setup crude preliminary demo of flow visualization any inputs are appreciated
121775 using frac gm the force on point mass located at au from the sun cdot text kg is about kg does that mean that kg person is 42g lighter during the day and 42g heavier at night that seems like it could make big difference for things like measuring gold bars or other weight sensitive items gold arbitrage buy your gold during the day and sell it during the night risk free profit this makes me suspect that im overlooking something obvious because weight difference seems like something everyone would have noticed long ago so what am missing edit few answers below indicate that there shouldnt be any weight difference because the earth orbits the sun in free fall but if thats the reason does that mean that tidally locked earth sun system wouldnt experience differential gravity from the sun on opposite sides that doesnt seem right

121830 the bit that makes sense tidal forces my physics teacher explained that most tidal effect is caused by the moon rotating around the earth and some also by the sun they said that in the earth and moon system the bodies are in freefall about each other but that points on the surface of earth not being at earths centre of gravity experience slightly different pulls towards the moon the pull is little greater if they are on the moons side and slightly lesser if they are on the side away from the moon once freefall is removed on the moon side this feels like pull towards the moon and on the the opposite side it feels like repulsion from the moon this makes sense to me and is backed up by other questions and answers here like this and also this phys se question the bit that doesnt make sense tidal bulges they also said that there are tidal bulges on opposite sides of the earth caused by these forces the bulges stay still relative to the moon and earth rotating through the bulges explains why we get two tides day they drew picture like this one an image search for tidal bulges finds hundreds of similar examples but if there is tidal bulge on both sides of earth like big wave with two peaks going round and around how can an island like great britain where live simultaneously have high tide on one side and low tide on the other for example holyhead tide times on the west coast whitby tide times on the east two ports with tides hours or apart its high tide at one while low tide at the other but they are only miles distant by road great britain is much smaller than earth its probably not even as big as the letter in the word tidal in that picture to prove this isnt just britain being crazy anomaly here is another example from new zealand westport new zealand south island kaikoura peninsula new zealand south island two ports that are hours apart but separated by just delightful miles through national park new zealand unlike the uk is in fairly open ocean
122102 this isnt question of how wing works vortex flow bernoullis principle all of that jazz instead its question of why we need wing at all wing produces lift but why is that necessary got to this by thinking of an airplane at coarse level the wing produces lift through some interesting physics but it needs energy to do this the engine is what ultimately provides all of this energy lets assume no headwind and in ultimately im not including chemical energy in the fuel yadda yadda it all comes from the sun that means the engine pushes enough air and fast enough to offset gravity and still propel the plane forward so the question is why cant we just angle the engine down bit and get the same effect to slightly reword why do wings help us divert part of an engines energy downward in way thats more efficient than just angling the engine one answer is that we can do exactly that im guessing its what helicopters and vtol airplanes like the harrier do but thats less efficient why one analogy that comes to mind is that of car moving uphill the engine doesnt have the strength to do it alone so we use gears for every rotations the engine makes the wheel makes one stronger rotation this makes intuitive sense to me in laymans terms the gears convert some of the engines speed energy into strength energy is this analogy applicable is the wing on plane like the gearbox in my transmission and if so whats the wing doing more concretely if gear converts angular speed to increased force what does wing convert to what none of the answers could guess at satisfied my intuition if the wing converts horizontal speed to vertical speed tipping the engine downward would seem to have the same effect if its changing the volume speed of the air more air blown slower or less air blown faster it would still have to obey the conservation of energy meaning that the total amount of kinetic energy of the air is the same again suggesting that the engine could just be tipped down edit in thinking about this more from the answers provided ive narrowed down my question lets say we want certain amount of forward force to combat friction and maintain speed and certain amount of lift to combat gravity and maintain altitude if we tilt our engine the forces required look like this the total amount of force required is sqrt that seems pretty efficient to me how can horizontal engine wing produce the same and with smaller

122231 newtons second law says ma now if we put we get which is newtons first law so why do we need newtons first law before asking did some searching and got this newtons first law is necessary to define inertial reference frame on which the second law can be applied but why cant we just use newtons second law to define an inertial frame so if but is not equal to or vice versa the frame is non inertial one can say can one we cannot apply the second law to define reference frame because it is only applicable to inertial frames thus unless we know in advance that frame is inertial we cant apply the second law but then why this is not the problem for the first law we dont need to know it in advance about the frame of reference to apply the first law because we take the first law as definition of an inertial reference frame similarly if we take the second law as the definition of an inertial frame it should not be necessary to know whether the frame is inertial or not to apply the second law to check that the frame is inertial
122273 am trying to calculate an efficient acceleration curve given starting and final positions and velocities im assuming no friction and that the acceleration can be applied in any direction at any time given starting position starting velocity final position final velocity total time want to find nice at function that will produce final conditions so far have the following solution that works but produces an incredibly inefficient at curve first calculate the constant acceleration required to get from to cfrac then calculate the change in position this acceleration will create over cfrac next calculate the average velocity required to get from to and to counteract cfrac next calculate the acceleration needed to produce this average velocity over the total time cfrac finally add twice that acceleration to the first half of my acceleration function and subtract twice that acceleration from the second half this produces the net position change that want but has net velocity acceleration change so stays correct at begin cases leq frac frac end cases while this solution provides result it can cause the simulated objects im working with to move backward before moving toward their final goal along with other weird behavior think the ideal solution would minimize total acceleration applied over time and thus force since the mass of the object will stay constant over this time know that the constraints on this problem are that the integral of at must equal and that the integral of that integral must equal just dont know how to setup the problem to solve for those constraints dont even really know what should google for to try and solve this problem any help would be greatly appreciated
122374 was running the washing up water this morning and started to think about why the cold tap isnt hot and why the water doesnt get hotter the faster it is flowing if anything the cold tap gets colder the faster it flows from my understanding frac mv and temperature is directly proportional to kinetic energy know that the in the above equation is really the mean speed of the particles and therefore some are moving backwards and some moving forwards it is the speed that is used but surely the particles of water in the tap are all moving faster therefore they should all be hotter perhaps the particles in the stream are moving at much higher mean speed than the water is flowing so the temperature increase is negligible am correct in thinking this or otherwise why doesnt the cold tap get hot the more you turn it on
122469 if one is watching relativistic object of spherical shape which emits enough light to be detectable it will despite being lorentz contracted appear of its natural shape although rotated this phenomenon is called terrel rotation dagger citing wikipedia on lorentz contraction length contraction is the phenomenon of decrease in length measured by the observer of an object which is traveling at any non zero velocity relative to the observer so how can the observer actually measure this decrease in length can it be somehow done in non relativistic regime of measurement apparatus dagger russian version of the page gives more detail with some pictures

122601 our eyes contain photoreceptor cells cones to perceive three wavelength ranges of light here is visual representation of the wavelengths by these receptors and so if we have light of nm it results in the color blue if we have light of nm it results in the color green if we see light of nm it results in the color red think understand our ability of the brain to mix the results of the signals of these receptors producing colors like yellow however what do not understand is how the color spectrum is displayed like this given that spectrum would suggest that the color blue is actually mix between the receptors and and the pure result of activating the receptor would result in the color purple would describe the color in the left of the image as purple right therefore the receptor colors should instead be rgp red green purple instead of rgb red green blue however there is one problem with this which cannot explain how come that mixing red light with blue light also results in purple light how is it possible that purple light can be achieved through mixing additively blue and red light just as going to the shortest wavelength boundary of what we can see from blue to ultraviolet via purple so the actual problem here is purple is the color at the very shortest wavelength we can see purple is an additive mix between what we see as red light and blue light that just doesnt make any sense dont see how our brain can possibly perceive this as being the same color shouldnt both purple colors actually be different colors thus we would have new different color for that update pure activation of the cone blue may actually give violet instead of blue that means that the color blue contains also bit activation from the and cones green and red so then the blue est blue is actually violet not blue this confusion originates from the rgb system and other sources that assume blue as being primary color whereas violet would perhaps be more accurate further details can be found in the accepted answer the line of purples may further help to understand what purple magenta violet really is
122637 im studying gauss law and came across section where were supposed to find the electric field of various shapes like an infinite line of charges etc and for an infinite plane with uniform positive charge per area it says here in my notes planar symmetry charge distribution doesnt change if we slide it in any direction parallel to the sheet at each point the field is perpendicular to the sheet and it must have the same magnitude at any given distance on either side of the sheet its not clear to me why having charge distribution that doesnt change will result in field perpendicular to the sheet can anyone help me clarify
122659 bear with me while try to explain exactly what the question is the question can curvature in time and not space cause acceleration is imagining coordinate system in which the curvature is only in the time coordinate want to be as precise as possible about what we mean by curvature in the time coordinate it seems to me that good starting point is the geodesic equation mu over tau gamma mu alpha beta dx alpha over tau dx beta over tau because if we stick to cartesian coordinates then in flat space all the christoffel symbols vanish and were left with mu over tau so coordinate system in which spacetime is only curved in the time coordinate would be one in which begin align over tau ne mu ne over tau end align so my question is whether this is sensible perspective
122687 let us choose to postulate considering the analogy of the hamiltonian being generator of time evolution in classical mechanics hbar frac hat dt hat hat tag where hat is the unitary linear evolution operator and hat the hamiltonian the most general version of which time dependent with instances at different times non commuting in picture one can easily show that is equivalent to hbar frac dt psi st rangle hat psi st rangle tag where psi is state psi st rangle hat psi s0 rangle equiv hat psi rangle and hat hat in picture it is straightforward to show that implies frac hat dt frac partial hat partial frac hbar hat hat tag where is an observable and hat ht hat dagger hat h0 hat equiv hat dagger hat hat and also hat hat implying that the time dependence of hat is purely explicit hat hat equiv hat with hat hat my question is it possible to obtain from to show that is equivalent to some thoughts on this it is extensively mentioned in literature that both pictures yield same answers therefore it should be possible to obtain from since and are equivalent assuming the best can get is that given an observable the operator hat hat left frac hat dt hat dagger frac hat hbar right must be skew hermitian
122742 this question has puzzled me for long time there is already question like this on physics se johns answer to the question seems quite satisfying but when googled the cause found this and this explanation they maybe wrong but think how stuff works is reliable source and heres the original paper am quite confused now reading the different explanations can anyone please shed some light on the issue
122785 the video how far can legolas see by minutephysics recently went viral the video states that although legolas would in principle be able to count horsemen text km away he shouldnt have been able to tell that their leader was very tall understand that the main goal of minutephysics is mostly educational and for that reason it assumes simplified model for seeing but if we consider more detailed model for vision it appears to me that even with human size eyeballs and pupils dagger one might actually be able to in principle distinguish smaller angles than the well known angular resolution theta approx frac lambda so heres my question using the facts that elves have two eyes which might be useful as in the very large array eyes can dynamically move and change the size of their pupils and assuming that legolas could do intensive image processing the density of photoreceptor cells in legolass retina is not limiting factor here elves are pretty much limited to visible light just as humans are they had the cleanest air possible on earth on that day how well could legolas see those horsemen dagger im not sure if this is an accurate description of elves in tolkiens fantasy
122830 specifically during the moves towards le syst me international dunit in the 18th and 19th centuries why didnt anyone attempt to move us away from the definition of there being hours in day wikipedia informed me that the name second comes from the second division of an hour it also claims that the concept of having hours in day dates back at least years to the earliest egyptian civilization it also says the word second as measurement of time didnt make it into english until the 1500s and couldnt be measured with any accuracy for years so by one way of looking at things the base unit of time or perhaps the grand pappy unit of time is the hour is there some convenient property of hours day that caused it to hold on while other units were phased out understand the significance of degree being 360th of circle and shares all of its factors but that seems flimsy reason the math for converting earths rotation to elapsed time doesnt even work out very conveniently imo with these units expected to find reason in time being one of the basic properties of the universe being immutable in 18th century eyes and therefore used as pivot point for other unit definitions but the dependency graph of si units mostly dispelled me of that both temperature and mass were found to be as independent as time and both units were redefined during this period to kelvins and kilograms respectively during the same period other units were attempted to be re measured from new standards the measure of length was changed to be the meter at one ten millionth from the north pole to the equator in the measure of mass was changed to the gram at the cube of the hundredth part of the meter filled with water at stp in the measure of temperature was changed to be degrees celsius one hundredth of the separation between boiling and freezing of water and eventually kelvins and yet efforts to define the second seem to center on more perfect measures of the existing definition of 86400th of the earths rotation given the predilection for base and the gradual move away from units depending on our earthly frame of reference why was the second left at such cumbersome ancient interval why didnt we redefine new measure of time to be say 100000th of day put hours in day etc etc did no one think to challenge the convention of hours in day why not that came out little more jumbled than it was in my head so let me sum up im mainly interested in answers addressing attempts to redefine units of time and why they didnt achieve wide adoption in the scientific community
122911 know black conducts heat while white reflects it but they are colors after all if metal is painted black it conducts more heat or at rapid speed than it would do before it was coated but as far as know colors dont have any special substance in them which might trigger the sudden absorption of heat or reflection of the same what is the physics behind this are colors by themselves some catalyst kinda thing

123039 understand that the inner product of two vectors is conserved under the lorentz transformations so that the absolute value of the four momentum is the same in any reference frame this is what most likely mistakenly thought was meant by the conservation of momentum dont understand why equations such as are momentum vectors for different particles in collision for example should hold within reference frame ive been told that you cant just add four velocities together on collision of particles so why should you be able to do this with the momentum vectors
123109 how strong would have to be nuclear explosion on exo planet that orbits some other star for it to be detectable outside of that system or it would be impossible due to amount of radiation coming from that star could the angle at which radiation would go out of that system be indicator or light interference would make it impossible update atmospheric nuclear explosions produce unique signature often called double humped curve short and intense flash lasting around millisecond followed by second much more prolonged and less intense emission of light taking fraction of second to several seconds to build up the effect occurs because the surface of the early fireball is quickly overtaken by the expanding atmospheric shock wave composed of ionised gas although it emits considerable amount of light itself it is opaque and prevents the far brighter fireball from shining through as the shock wave expands it cools down becoming more transparent allowing the much hotter and brighter fireball to become visible again no single natural phenomenon is known to produce this signature could this be used to identify or double humped curve would be of no help in space due to radio pollution of many double humped curves produced by stars

123456 ive been reading about the photoelectric effect for my modern physics class and was confused about how ohms law works in relation to it lets say we have photoelectric apparatus that simply generates some current and then applies stopping potential to bring the current to zero if we increase the intensity this increases the current however then ir and resistance remains the same so shouldnt voltage increase this is against the fact that intensity and stopping potential are independent so does this mean that ohms law just fails in this case thanks so much
123483 my year old daughters school report says that shes good at understanding the basic science shes doing but shes having trouble seeing how experimental results lead to conclusions specifically it says she struggles to appreciate how changing parameters in an experiment can be used to prove or rule out hypothesis im biologist chemist by degree and found it hard to think of any parameter based experiments in my field that we could do at home that wouldnt bore child they like creepy crawlies well enough but biology experiments tend to need time and repeat observations to get result chemistry tends to need more specialist equipment and reagents ive got couple of books of home science and scoured the net as well but most of the living room science experiments found that were suitable for an year old were more demonstrations than actual experiments there were few parameters nothing you could really vary so can any of your learned people suggest some simple parameter based physics experiments we could do at home or in the garden without specialist equipment which involve science at level an eight year old could engage with
123525 this is question with philosophical as well as physical flavor why should physical principle or description of one be applicable to different systems that can be in different positions in space and time in other words why should there be such modulo equivalence classes with respect to physical principle why not custom physical principle per case let me give one simple example newtons laws are applicable to my desk to my table to your desk to your table and to someones table say year from now or year ago why is this why should the same principle be aplicable to such different systems different in the sense stated above anyone know how to approach such question note in order to avoid misunderstandings regardless of the tags of this question this is not specifically about covariance the tag was used by an editor because the original tag laws of physics was removed for other reasons
123591 my textbook says on conduction these free electrons can rapidly carry energy from the hotter to the cooler regions of the metal so metals are generally good conductors of heat metal rod at deg feels colder than piece of wood at deg because heat can flow more easily from your hand into the metal wouldnt the metal rod be hotter because more heat is transferred from the hand to the metal

123753 at simple level speeding in car attempts to minimize the time required to travel distance by utilizing the basic relationship st so for given distance time should be inversely proportional to speed the faster you go the less time it takes my question is on practical level does this actually help you get to your destination much faster say you are travelling on average mph sorry for non si units as an american driving in kph just seems wrong over the speed limit which is often considered safe for avoiding traffic ticket does this shave seconds off your commute time minutes believe that traffic can be modeled using fluid dynamics havent actually seen those models myself just have been told this is the case so how does this come to in to play while speeding it seems to me that it would depend on where you speed rather than how fast speeding to avoiding getting stuck at traffic light any insights or calculations would be greatly appreciated thanks
123874 everyone says that time stops in the black hole its fact however have never heard everyone explaining that of course know that observer in weaker gravitational field sees that something in stronger gravitational field is experiencing slower time however slower and no at all is quite different have no idea what equation is used to calculate dime dilatation but it will use gamma and therefore division and the only time division of non zero constant yields zero is when you divide by infinity and although black holes are super heavy super badass and super black they posses finite energy and therefore finite gravitational acceleration even at event horizon so shouldnt just the time be very slow rather than just stop from our point of view
125903 have seen many questions of this type but could nowhere find the answer to why know this is phenomenon which has been seen and discovered and we know it happens and how it happens but my question is why would wavelength affect the amount of diffraction am looking for very simple logical explanation rather than complex mathematical answer why will blue ray bend lesser than red ray through slit of the size little bigger than the wavelength of the blue ray need an answer that will answer why does diffraction depend on wavelength of light image sources http www olympusmicro com primer java diffraction index html
125932 this veritasium video explains how electromagnets can be explained by special relativity and how the magnetic field surrounding current carrying wire can also be viewed as an electric field if your frame of reference is moving with respect to the wire the example they use is positively charged cat moving along current carrying wire in the same direction as the electron drift if you view this from the rest frame of the cat then the electrons drift velocity is zero while the protons are moving to the left because the protons are moving length contraction makes it look like to the cat there are more of them giving the wire net positive charge repelling the cat this makes sense and is all kinds of elegant and intuitive it explains electromagnets in way that depends on only three simple concepts motion is relative things contract in their direction of apparent motion opposite charges attract like charges repel groovy now back up in the video derek says now the number of protons is equal to the number of negative electrons so overall the wire is neutral so if there were positively charged cat nearby it would experience no force from the wire at all and even if there were current in the wire the electrons would just be drifting in one direction but the density of positive and negative charges would still be the same and so the wire would be neutral so no force on the kitty wait what why is it that in the cats frame the protons are moving are contracted and the wire is charged but in dereks frame the electrons are moving but are not contracted and the wire is still neutral how can you say well length contraction creates charge imbalances allowing magnetic forces to be explained as electrical ones if you choose the right reference frame but simultaneously say but length contraction doesnt happen sometimes thats not elegant at all is there an elegant intuitive1 explanation meaning ive seen the math on wikipedia and its over my head there is also current in wire special relativity magnetism where the answer to my question seems to be the lorentz force ok but that negates the elegance of the explanation above with only three simple axioms are they not sufficient if so why

125995 the obvious answer is hydrogen and helium plasma but the nuclear fusion can also create heavier elements are these heavier elements significant portion of the core do the heavier elements sink to the bottom of the core like iron has during planetary formation presumably during the suns formation it would have accreted heavy elements made by previous generations of stars does this just get added to the mix
126077 related why does earth have minimum orbital period was learning about gps satellite orbits and came across that low earth orbits leo have period of about minutes at an altitude of km when took mechanics course couple of years ago we were assigned problem that assumed that if one could drill hole through the middle of the earth and then drop an object into it what would your period of oscillation be it just happens to be number that remembered and it was minutes see hyperphysics so if fine tuned the leo orbit to vanishing altitude in theory could get its period to be minutes as well of course am ignoring air drag my question is why are these two periods oscillating through the earth and zero altitude leo the same am sure that there is some fundamental physical reason that am missing here help
126088 have been thinking about ways of teaching electronics and im wondering if the following is true for starters when we talk about voltage as energy per unit charge is this energy manifest simply as the kinetic energy of the electron so all other things being equal will the electrons coming out of volt battery will have twice the velocity of electrons coming out of volt battery because of over mv this would seem to imply that the voltage drop across different parts of the circuit is essentially comparison of the electron speeds at those points furthermore doesnt this imply that the electrons are nearly halted by the time they reach the positive terminal of the battery this makes intuitive sense to me it seems pedagogically sound and it provides an explanation for how electrons know to give up their energy across the circuit electrostatic repulsion communicates later resistances to earlier parts of the circuit how much of the above is correct the one things that makes me suspicious is that in this picture electron density at the positive terminal of the battery is very high and repulsive forces would prohibit this on the other hand if the joules per coulomb are not coming from kinetic energy then what the field but wouldnt that just dissipate as light something is wrong but dont know what
126101 so im reading text on electricity and it talks about using the integral to compute the total charge of collection of points which mostly understand but then we get to finding the electric field due to charged collection of points and find things that dont make sense to me for instance for an infinite sheet of constant charge the text says that the electric field is constant on any one side of the sheet but that seems intuitively wrong to me since would think the field should be stronger the closer point is to the sheet mean if im standing meters from sheet holding charged particle and walk closer to the sheet id think the particle would react more strongly follow the mathematical derivation fairly well which leads me to think must not be thinking about the physics correctly can anyone help make this make sense

126504 layman here stumbling through some physics stack posts and started reading the wikipedia for the chronology of the big bang in it it states the very earliest universe was so hot or energetic that initially no matter particles existed or could exist except perhaps fleetingly and the forces we see around us today were believed to be merged into one unified force space time itself expanded during an inflationary epoch due to the immensity of the energies involved gradually the immense energies cooled still to temperature inconceivably hot compared to any we see around us now but sufficiently to allow forces to gradually undergo symmetry breaking kind of repeated condensation from one status quo to another leading finally to the separation of the strong force from the electroweak force and the first particles where is the immense energy going to when it is cooled is there now no immense energy
126512 the ghostly passage of one body through another is obviously out of the question if the continuum assumption were valid but we know that at the micro nano pico levels and beyond this is not even remotely the case my understanding is that the volume of the average atom actually occupied by matter is vanishingly small fraction of the atoms volume as whole if this is the case why cant matter simply pass through other matter are the atoms electrons so nearly omnipresent that they can simultaneously prevent collisions intersections from all possible directions

126622 when quantum entanglement is explained in laymans terms it seems to me that the first premise that we have to accept on faith is that particle doesnt have certain property the particle is not in one state or another until that property is measured for example have read that particle may have spin up or spin down but heres where get lost its not that we dont know which spin the particle has until we measure it but actually the particle has neither spin until we measure it now if we accept that premise then we can see how spooky it is when two particles are created with correlated spins if one has spin up the other has spin down but neither particle has either spin until one of them is measured at that instant the other particle assumes the other spin at least thats how interpret things have read certainly if we accept that particle doesnt actually have the property until it is measured but rather the particle exists in superposition of states until the measurement is made then we regular citizens can understand what is meant by spooky action at distance as soon as one particle is measured the other particle assumes the other spin no matter how far away it is how did the second particle know the first particle was measured that think is the spooky action at distance and the information transfer can be faster than light however from laymans perspective want to cry out but the particle does have definite spin we just dont know what it is until it is measured duh now cant believe that all of the physics community hasnt thought of that objection but heres my point although the spooky action at distance can be explained to us once we accept the premise of superposition why isnt the fact of superposition explainable also in terms mortals can understand have looked but havent found laymans explanation of why we should accept the fact that particle doesnt have particular spin or other property until its measured it sure seems that the particles have the properties even though we havent measured them yet know that much of quantum mechanics is not intuitive if anyone can explain why particles dont have definite property even before we measure them would be grateful

126919 while answering the question gps satellite special relativity it occurred to me that time would run more slowly at the equator than at the north pole because the surface of the earth is moving at about compared to the north pole the difference should be given by frac gamma approx frac frac and at mathrm we get frac gamma approx times this is tiny difference about days over the billion year lifetime of the universe but according to wikipedia the accuracy of current atomic clocks is about part in so the difference should be measurable however have never heard of any measurements of the difference is there flaw in my reasoning or have simply not been reading the right journals

128310 is the concept of rest mass correct all these years we me and my classmates of undergraduate 1st year have been accustomed to the concept of rest mass and the relativistic transformation of mass at speeds of the order of we had been introduced to this concept during our school years we were comfortable with it for quite long period of time until yesterday when our teacher declared with convincing degree of confidence that it is not mass that changes relativistically but rather it is the momentum possessed by the body that does so mass as he says is an invariant he even declared that the conception that we had so long cherished in our hearts is wrong one naturally the whole class was wonder struck am looking here for views on the subject from other reliable sources because am rather we all are in rather big dilemma whether to accept our teachers view or to reject it you should know that our undergrad classes have started just days ago and at the very onset we have faced heavy weight punch

128323 understand that the dirac equation has negative and positive sets of solutions and this contributes to its quantization by superposition of two fourier modes represented as creation and annihilation operators what about complex dirac field for representing antiparticle fields dont understand why real field cant describe the antiparticles alone since it was the negative solutions of the real dirac field which first sparked the antiparticle debate
128356 have recently read an article about gravitation slingshot assist used by voyagers and was thinking on why this hasnt been used for travel between solar and other systems mean sligshot can be done as many times as it is necessary to get speed of lets say half the speed of light that would allow to travel to alpha centauri in years can it not there must be flaw in my thinking that or planets can be re used to get to necessary speed otherwise it would already have been done drawing below even if planets would align differently should always be able find the planet that would allow me to jump to one that is closer to the sun and repeat the acceleration again and again what maximum theoretical speed could be achieved using planets of solar system as sligshot and how much would this speed wary from planetary alignment and what realistic speed could be achieved update to be more specific on the second part of the question lets say craft weights 500kg at starting speed of km initially it slings around mercury radius 2440km venus radius atmosphere km and earth radius 300atmosphere 6050km until diameter of planets is to wide to not to crash craft on surface then it flies to the moons of saturn titan radius 5150km rhea 1527km lapetus 1470km dione 1123km tethys 1062km enceladus504km mimas 396km and starts slinging there until diameter is to wide too what approximate maximum speed could it get to leave the solar system
128374 when discussing physics with laypersons im often in the situation where have to explain what the standard model is and why its successful theory of particle physics to help in such situations im looking for explicit examples of where the standard model has been successful the prediction of certain particles incredible agreement between experimental theoretical results and so on conversely what if any are the failures of the standard model apart from the the obvious not including gravity one are there theoretical predictions which differ significantly from experimental results
128408 in this blog post found this picture there are other similar photos and does the water really form golden ratio spiral in such cases or is the photo just provocative example without physics grounds for claims about goldness of the spiral
128468 consider the experiment in this link the experiment includes using ruler as lever with an inflated balloon on one side and balloon which is not inflated on the other the aim of the experiment is to show that air has mass have seen many kids performing similar experiments but if the air pressure inside the balloon is equal to that outside then the buoyant force will cancel out the weight of the air inside the balloon wont it
128512 in em radiation the magnetic field is times smaller than the electric field but is it valid to say its weaker these fields have different units so dont think you can compare them but even so it seems like we only interact with the electric field of em radiation not the magnetic field why is this
128598 work done is defined as the dot product of force and displacement however intuitively should it not be the product of force and the time for which the body is acted upon by the force force time because while time is independent of force applied displacement is not were these formulae for work and energy actually derived based on some physical understanding or are they just constructs to understand forces better
128626 what would be good estimate on the difference of efficiency between road bike and mountain bike number of links cite all the usual reasons thinner tires better aerodynamics but im not able to find one where they quantify this efficiency
128627 since renewcommand unit mathrm unit dm unit it follows that unit dm times times unit unit however in regular mathematics the following equation holds true by the above the cube unit should expand as follows mathrm dm mathrm dmmm while in actual usage as seen in the second equation the expansion is mathrm dddmmm which would arise from using mathrm dm instead mathrm dm mathrm dddmmm so shortly why arent parentheses commonly used in units
128650 we can think that the electric field and the gravitational field operate similarly in the sense that the forms of their governing laws namely coulombs law and newtons law respectively are strikingly similar the only difference one can point out is that while the electric charges come in two flavors the gravitational masses come in just one now have read that when charged particle moves the electric field lines associated with are distorted in fashion because of the finite time required for the information about the change in the position of the charge to get propagated and have led to the understanding that this is the cause of the existence of the magnetic field and that if calculus is used it can be proven mathematically so if this is true then why doesnt the same thing happen to the gravitational field why is there nothing like gravitational magnetic field or is there note have changed the language and the tone of the question massively although the question was fairly well received believe it was really ill posed as pointed out by acuriousmind in the comment the reasondescribed here behind the existence of the magnetic field is something that cannot be found good support for but still due to the similarity between the equations describing their static behavior of electric and gravitational fields one can still ask as to whether boost would create some sort of gravitational magnetic field if the original frame only had static gravitational field as the accepted answer points out the answer is roughly yes but the maxwell type equations for gravity arent as well behaved as are the original maxwell equations of electromagnetism one should note in particular the equations for gravity take the maxwell like form in appropriate weak limits only in some appropriately chosen gauges and arent lorentz covariant
128705 how did they take photos of jupiter mean jupiter is illuminated and thats lot of light to produce am missing something and there was some sort of dark photo technology used or was there simply enough light from sun to begin with or is this photo fake
128785 different kinds of white light have different spectrum light from white led will have blue at the peak intensity while white light from cfl or something else will have different looking spectrum dont understand how this works shouldnt pure white light have unique spectrum no matter what for example certain white leds spectrum looks like this hspace 100px
128816 the following graph shows the result of very impressive differential measurement of the gravitational field in boulder colorado over period of couple of days floris got it from description in book and posted it as part of an answer to this question based on the caption im guessing that the experiment was described in this paper by zumberge which dont have access to there is excellent agreement between theory and experiment and the main features of the graph are these two fourier components period hrs peak to peak amplitude approx times10 period hrs peak to peak amplitude approx times10 in addition there is slower trend which assume comes from interference between the solar and lunar effects assuming perfectly rigid earth no solar effect no effect from ocean tides and two dimensional geometry my calculation in this answer gives the following for the apparent field when the moon is at the zenith and when the moon is at its nadir frac frac 2gmr 0r frac 3gmr 0r frac frac 2gmr 0r frac 3gmr 0r the difference is 6gmr 0r times10 which is far too small to explain the observed diurnal effect gather that ocean tides can have not just semidiurnal component but diurnal one as well dont know why this is whatever the mechanism is conceivably that same mechanism would also cause the diurnal effect observed here assume that the gravitational field of the ocean is not itself responsible for the effect observed here since the experiment was done in boulder colorado the spectacular agreement between theory and experiment shows that the diurnal experiment must be well understood theoretically what causes it
128882 so in wired wireless networking and radio signals are sent in form of wave then the concept of bandwidth comes in which is the difference between highest frequency and lowest frequency in signal but do not get why bandwidth determines the maximum information per second that can be sent if we are able to send signals of any frequency in the bandwidth then as the number of signals that are of frequencies in an aggregated signal increases information that can be sent increases without bound is this not possible because when adding some frequency information in some frequency is necessarily violated and why does maximum information per second that can be sent depends only on bandwidth not highest frequency in the aggregated signal
128938 as we know the mass energy equivalence relation mc originally came from special relativity and the binding energy is delta mc how do we know that the extra mass coming from theoretical calculation is associated with the binding energy what is special relativity inside the nucleus
129134 have seen similar posts but havent seen what seems to be clear and direct answer why do only certain number of electrons occupy each shell why are the shells arranged in certain distances from the nucleus why dont electrons just collapse into the nucleus or fly away it seems there are lots of equations and theories that describe how electrons behave pauli exclusion principle predictions about where they may be located schr dinger equation uncertainty principle etc but hard to find the why and or causality behind these descriptive properties what is it about the nucleus and the electrons that causes them to attract repel in the form of these shells at regular intervals and numbers of electrons per shell please be patient with me new to this forum and just an amateur fan of physics
129143 why is avogadros law always true how and why do equal volumes of gases at equal pressure and temperature contain equal number of molecules know it is fundamental principle in chemistry but wonder how it works
129160 we want to launch projectile from the surface of earth so that its distance from the point of projection is always increasing what is the maximum angle of projection for which this is possible one way to visualize this would be that there should not be component of velocity opposite to the position vector of the particle the point of projection being the origin at all times of motion so following this line of thought wrote overrightarrow cdot overrightarrow which did not yield very nice expression in the angle theta there should be better methods as is often the case with physics please suggest some of them
129190 forgive me for the silly question but just dont get it just completed an elementary course in mechanics and am curious to know what am about to ask we have all year dealt with many forces like gravity friction normal forces tensions etc but only one of them is listed as fundamental force that is gravity know that the only forces that exist in nature are the four fundamental force and all of these are apparently non contact forces but then how do you account for for example friction we know that text frictional mu but how do we arrive at that is this experimental cannot see how contact forces like friction can exist when none of the fundamental force is contact force again forgive me for my ignorance

129429 moons orbit planets planets orbit stars and stars orbit the center of galaxy so my question is what does galaxy orbit the center of universe know that the universe has no center
129449 the expression int psi leftx right 2dx gives the probability of finding particle at given position if wave function gives the probabilities of positions why do we calculate expectation value of position dont understand the conceptual difference we already have wave function of position expectation value is related to probabilities so what is the differences between them and why do we calculate expectation value for position although we have function for probability of finding particle at given position
129492 background ive lived in philippines for several years and visited other parts of asia occasionally singapore indonesia hongkong just moved to western australia few months ago and realized that the sun is brighter here in the sense that every after sunrise and every nearing sunset the sun shines too bright that it is blinding this happens almost everyday so this isnt just some one off thing in asia this never occurred to me the sun was always bearable to the eyes why is this so
129525 how does this number get calculated about years after the big bang the temperature of the universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms http en wikipedia org wiki photon epoch ive seen it in many places or something close to that but there is never citation or any explanation
129626 why cant cables used for computer networking transfer data really fast say at the speed of light ask this because electricity travels at the speed of light take ethernet cables for example looked them up on wikipedia propagation speed why only what does propagation speed mean know there are other variables affecting the latency and perceived speed of computer network connections but surely this is bottle neck in other words im asking what is it about fiber optics cable that makes it faster than an ethernet cable
129632 will we ever reach point where all the light that was set free by recombination finally reaches us from our point of view and the cmb stops shining for observers on earth
129731 suppose we have cube of metal inside room at temperature if we heat the metal up to using uniform radiation of that energy no part of it should have higher but nevertheless it will start emitting visible light that is thermal photons with temperature in the excess of how is that possible am aware of thermal radiation blackbody etc the first question is when the metal is at thermal equilibrium with the room are there inside it or inside the room any molecules atoms with energy in the range of if the answer is affirmative the question has been fully answered if is negative we need follow up question
129873 in video here saw crocodiles jump vertically about three meters without using any solid surface the wonderful thing is that when they start to jump their vertical velocity is approximately zero unlike fish who jump using initial velocity it seems that crocodiles create an upward force that counteracts gravity because when they are rising their velocity seems to be constant how is this possible could anyone explain this phenomenon using physics laws
129978 want to ask if it is reasonable that use the dirac delta function as an initial state psi x0 for the free particle wavefunction and interpret it such that say that the particle is exactly at during time if use this initial state can also use it to predict how the wavefunction should evolve in time that is if psi x0 deltax then phik frac sqrt pi int infty infty deltaxe ikx dx frac sqrt pi then psixt frac sqrt pi int infty infty phike ikx omega dk or psixt frac pi int infty infty ikx omega dk is the above wavefunction valid expression to see how particle that is initially localized in the origin evolves in time
129987 why does mass attract all the masses around it why shouldt it repel or just stay calm why should it be like that
130098 my understanding of pseudovectors vs vectors is pretty basic both transform in the same way under rotation but differently upon reflection might even be able to summarize that using an equation but thats about it similarly can follow arguments that pseudovectors behave differently in mirrors than vectors but my response to this is always okay so what when would ever do physics in mirror the usefulness eludes me id like to gain better understanding of the importance of this difference when is it useful for an experimental physicist to distinguish between the two when is it useful for theoretical physicist to distinguish between the two believe symmetry is important to at least one of these but would appreciate practical rather than abstract argument of when one has to be careful about the distinction
130239 as far as my knowledge is concerned vector quantity should possess magnitude and direction more over it should also obey the laws of vector addition as we all know that the vector sum of newtons in the direction and newtons in the direction will acting at point will produce resultant of newtons where did the remaining newtons go mean we have applied total of newtons of force on point sized particle but the output is only newtons so it appears as if newton force is disappearing here in which other form does it reappear rather than the resultant or is it something like the remaining newtons of force just vanishes and it doesnt appears in any other form please correct me if am going wrong on this issue
130268 am just starting to look into how we understand the data from particle collisions my question is what are the algorithms or ways that these detectors interpret the data are there standard approaches or if not what are some good papers or places to look to get started in learning more about the implementation and or details of how this works so far havent dug into any textbooks but many articles on the web and this was somewhat helpful in pointing to where to look http arstechnica com science all about particle smashers part ii so from my understanding so far there are few different lch experiments which are physical structures that are optimized to focus on specific aspects of data from collision event the detector measures all kinds of particle emissions and changes in electrical fields and then seems to try to backtrack and figure out all the emission decay events that might have taken place in that split second from my understanding so far basically the computer programs used to compute these possible decay pathways must be using some standard algorithms or something and must have built into them all possible particle emission pathways like all possible feynman diagrams if there is such thing are there any good resources or standard algorithms approaches to understanding how particle detectors analyze their data
130368 when quantizing yang mills theory we introduce the ghosts as way to gauge fix the path integral and make sure that we count only one contribution from each gauge orbit of the gauge field mu because physically only the orbits themselves correspond to distinct physical configurations whereas the motion within the gauge orbit should not contribute to the path integral how come we dont run into this problem when we quantize the fermions which also have gauge transformations and also have gauge orbit shouldnt we include gauge fixing term for the fermions as well or does the term introduced for the boson fields already pick out the gauge orbit for the fermions as well how does this technically come to be so far introduce gauge fixing term into the lagrangian as int left alpha right det left frac delta left mu left alpha right right delta alpha right delta leftg left left alpha right right right where alphax are the gauge functions and is functional which is non zero only for unique gauge representative in each gauge orbit where we have the transformations as begin cases psi mapsto left1 alpha right psi mathcal left left alpha right right mu mapsto mu frac mu ab alpha mathcal left left alpha right right end cases
130412 have few related questions where is the cmb coming emitted reflected remitted from when cmb hits the earth is that the first thing those photons hit since they were emitted thousand years after the big bang why isnt the cmb at the edges of the universe why is it flying around in the middle has the trajectory of the photons been bent by masses in the universe until it bends back inward or is the theory that the universe wraps around on itself
130450 is interstellar flight possible in the near future in way that would keep our civilization alive mean is it practically possible to obtain technology that would enable us to travel to nearby habitable earth like planets to keep our civilization alive for example consider this design for nasa star trek style space ship the ixs enterprise do you know any good site which goes into detail on both latest practical and theoretical development of this interstellar flight
130457 am looking to the windowed roof of my building and notice that the sky which has few white clouds sometimes looks completely gray as if there was huge cover of gray clouds but there are not by observing it and waiting for the change to happen notice it takes matter of seconds when the sun shines directly on the building but not directly on me the blue sky turns gray wonder if this is just an optical illusion because my vision of colour could be relative to its environment or if there is serious glass sun refraction effect or something havent found anything on that matter on the internet or on stack exchange so im asking you what you think about it additional information the top window is very peculiar glass its basically strong glass window because its almost horizontal it has to resist hits and looks like it is covered by layer of opaque black with big holes surface of holes is greater than surface of black from distance you dont see the holes also im taking the pictures from windowed office you see the sky through two glass windows but the one closest to me looks basic and didnt notice difference when looking through one layer you will also notice there is blue light some neon like directed at the roof but during the day its effect is negligible here are the pictures first the sky through top window without sun hitting the window then with the sun the colours exposition differences dont seem to make great difference compared to my naked eye observation the pictures were taken only few seconds apart you can see the same cloud in both pictures the gray sky isnt the most grayish ive observed it gets even farther away from blue sometimes
130459 have been searching the internet for answers to this question but havent found convincing one would appreciate any response understand why objects are opaque black for example when white light is incident on closed book lets say its blue all wavelengths of visible light except blue are absorbed and hence we see it as blue now from what read it is the electrons that absorb the non blue photons from the white light and jump to higher energy states my questions are do the electrons stay in the same state if they were to jump back to there original state shouldnt they emit photon that is exactly of the same wavelength as the one that was absorbed by it in the first place if they are in the same state why does the book continue to appear blue it cant absorb additional energy unless it returns back to its original state in doing so wont it emit photon of the same wavelength it absorbed in the first place and finally what part of the atom is reflecting the blue light is it bouncing electron
130521 in the derivation of the black body radiation formula there is nothing whatsoever that relates to particular specific material but we nonetheless use this formula for several distinct sources in nature such as the sun and the cmb how can it be applicable to so many different things as far as understand the emitted photons come from the rotational and vibrational levels but shouldnt these levels depend on the particular material elements that the object is made of summarising is the black body radiation formula applicable to an macroscopic object composed of different elements only how can it describe so different things eg sun spectrum cmb if there is nothing in the formula that relates to specific material element if the photons come from vibrational rotational levels transitions shouldnt these depend on the object in question also whats the actual reason why there are no contributions from translational motion and what about excited electrons
130552 understand that black hole bends the fabric of space time to point that no object can escape understand that light travels in straight line along spacetime unless distorted by gravity if spacetime is being curved by gravity then light should follow that bend in spacetime in newtons law of universal gravitation the mass of both objects must be entered but photon has no mass why should massless photon be affected by gravity in by newtons equations what am missing
130567 this question is similar to previously asked questions but the responses to them are confusing and think it may be better covered by listing out all the potential answers for clarity its simple and common question why does light seem to travel more slowly in media which is transparent to its wavelength than it does in vacuum have seen responses all over the web from phd professors at major universities whose answers are completely different here are all of the general categories of answers have seen professional physicists put forth light actually does move slower through transparent media we dont really know why light actually does move slower through transparent media the reason is that lights em effects induce nearby charged particles electrons and nuclei to alter the em field with harmonic vibration that cancels out some of the velocity of the light wave light does not move slower we dont know why it seems to light does not move slower it bounces around in the media which causes it to progress more slowly light does not move slower it is absorbed and emitted by electrons in the media which causes it to progress more slowly my thoughts on each of these if light actually moves slower but we havent figured out why would expect it to behave relativistically in manner similar to bradyons particles with invariant mass which cannot reach the speed of light but this is inconsistent with form of energy which does not experience time dont see how any explanation for slowed light other than can be consistent am currently leaning toward this answer even though it is the rarest one have seen however dont understand the mechanics of how light wave can be cancelled out or slowed by em induction my strong suspicion is that quantum effects are necessary that is light wouldnt be slowed at all were the environment always entangled with it if youre one of those copenhagen oddballs this means if the wavefunction were continuously collapsed such that the light behaves as individual photons this seems pretty likely dont expect physicists to talk out their asses but have hard time understanding why so many qualified physicists have completely different explanations for this basic principle this seems very unlikely to me despite being the second most common explanation have found if light were scattered it wouldnt progress in the same direction through the media it would disperse to slow appreciably it would need to ricochet off of billions of atoms along the way but we can see beam of light refract through transparent media and it doesnt diffuse much at all this is the most common explanation yet find it to be the least convincing not only do the issues from apply here but also we are talking about material which is almost completely transparent to the wavelength of light being refracted edit previously asserted here that the slowing effect does not depend upon the frequency of light which is incorrect see below is anybody who actually does physics for living certain you understand this phenomenon or are we all spitting blind in the dark its very frustrating to see physicists giving incompatible explanations with an air of certainty for phenomenon known since antiquity but suppose it may be possible that more than one explanation is true edit believe have the answer have answered my own question below
130594 has there been any experiments or are there any references demonstrating gravity between atoms if so what are the key experiments papers or if not what is the smallest thing that has actually experimentally been shown to be affected by gravity dont know of specific papers demonstrating gravity between larger objects but can vaguely remember learning about them in my classical physics class as an undergraduate however have never heard of experiments demonstrating gravity at atomic or subatomic levels dont have physics background so its not obvious to me so just looking to see the actual research evidence behind it so can start to try to imagine how gravity works at quantum level
130649 im currently reading alonso and finns electromagnetism book it explains that the spin contributes to the magnetic moment and is somewhat comparable to rotation of the particle around its own axis it says that the spin of particle is caused by certain internal structure which makes sense in the aforementioned analogy right underneath the paragraph with the explanation of spin it says the electron has no known internal structure but since it does have spin does that mean that we know the electron has an internal structure but we just dont know what it is
130688 found the problem described in the attached picture on the internet in the comment sections there were two opposing solutions so it made me wonder which of those would be the actual solution so basically the question would be the following assume we would have two identical beakers filled with the same amount of the same liquid lets say water in the left beaker ping pong ball would be attached to the bottom of the beaker with string and above the right beaker steel ball of the same size volume as the ping pong ball would be hung by string submerging the steel ball in the water as shown in the picture if both beakers would be put on to scale what side would tip according to the internet either of the following answers was believed to be the solution the left side would tip down because the ping pong ball and the cord add mass to the left side since they are actually connected to the system the right side would tip down because of buoyancy of the water on the steel ball pushing the steel ball up and the scale down now what would the solution be according to physics
130721 have no background in physics but there is question that has been bothering me so im asking you are there at least physical theories that are mathematically identical which means that they would yield identical predictions for every situation that these theories can cover and therefore can not be compared through experimentation the validity of one of them is equivalent to the validity of the other physically different that is to say based on different spatio temporal whatever realities whose differences are not only semantic if there are at least two theories that satisfy those requirements it would mean that the absolute metaphysical reality can never be known however if we are capable of mathematically demonstrating that such theories can not mathematically exist it would mean that absolute reality can be known when say mathematically identical am not speaking of theories that can not be experimented on due to technological constraints like atomism at the time when this was still debated but really of theories that can theoretically not be compared even by laplace demon do you agree with my assumptions if so is there such theories and or demonstration that they can not exist
130754 while was watching this beautiful video the absence of air friction pushed me to ask myself while standing on the surface of the moon what is the initial velocity by which you can fire bullet to put it into orbit around the moon so it will hit you in your back and how much time you should wait the bullet to hit you let us assume that the moon has no mountains and is perfect sphere and your height is meters
130800 this is question ive been asked several times by students and tend to have hard time phrasing it in terms they can understand this is natural question to ask and it is not usually well covered in textbooks so would like to know of various perspectives and explanations that can use when teaching the question comes up naturally in what is usually students second course in quantum physics quantum mechanics at that stage one is fairly comfortable with the concept of wavefunctions and with the schr dinger equation and has had some limited exposure to operators one common case for example is to explain that some operators commute and that this means the corresponding observables are compatible and that there exists mutual eigenbasis the commutation relation is usually expressed as ab but no more is said about that object this naturally leaves students wondering what is exactly the physical significance of the object ab itself and this is not an easy question would like answers to address this directly ideally at variety of levels of abstraction and required background note also that im much more interested in the object ab itself than what the consequences and interpretations are when it is zero as those are far easier and explored in much more depth in most resources one reason this is hard question and that commutators are such confusing objects for students is that they serve variety of purposes with only thin connecting threads between them at least as seen from the bottom up perspective commutation relations are usually expressed in the form ab even though priori there appears to be little motivation for the introduction of such terminology lot of stock is placed behind the canonical commutation relation xp hbar though it is not always clear what it means in my view the fundamental principle that this encodes is essentially de broglies relation lambda this is made rigorous by the stone von neumann uniqueness theorem but thats quite bit to expect student to grasp at first go from this there is natural extension to the heisenberg uncertainty principle which in its general form includes commutator and an anticommutator to make things worse canonically conjugate pairs of observables are often introduced and this is often aided by observations on commutators on the other hand the energy time and angle angular momentum conjugacy relations cannot be expressed in terms of commutators making things even fuzzier commutators are used very frequently for example when studying the angular momentum algebra of quantum mechanics it is clear they play big role in encoding symmetries in quantum mechanics but it is hardly made clear how and why and particularly why the combination ab ba should be important for symmetry considerations this becomes even more important in more rigorous treatments of quantum mechanics where the specifics of the hilbert space become less important and the algebra of observable operators takes centre stage the commutator is the central operation of that algebra but again its not very clear why that combination should be special an analogy is occasionally made to the poisson brackets of hamiltonian mechanics but this hardly helps poisson brackets are equally mysterious this also ties the commutator in with time evolution both on the classical side and via the heisenberg equation of motion cant think of any more at the moment but they are huge number of opposing directions which can make everything very confusing and there is rarely uniting thread so what are commutators exactly and why are they so important
130803 first of all im genuinely sorry if this question isnt serious enough for this forum common cliche in movies and tv is that very tough object eg the villain is frozen and then hit with something shattering into million pieces ive seen demo of flower being put into liquid nitrogen then being crumbled but flower is very delicate object to start off with if take leg of lamb for example out of the freezer dont feel like its in any danger of shattering into million bits unlike my foot if were to drop it so is the whole cold brittle thing just movie bullcrap or is there anything to it sticking with the leg of lamb example is there temperature to which leg of lamb could be dropped that would make the leg of lamb prone to shattering edit just realised that the question title could be read as is there anything which is rendered extremely brittle by extreme cold obviously there are some things eg flowers hence the title change
130829 we see waves propagate in air water through the cristal of metal and along rope isnt wave wonder of nature or is it just simple phenomenon are homogeneity and isotropy necessary properties for the correct propagation of waves update are rope water and space em field elastic in the same way
130918 ive seen in documentary that when star collapses and becomes black hole it starts to eat the planets around but it has the same mass so how does its gravitational field strength increase
130985 now this might be silly question but its actually bugging me this one might be easier to understand if you have kids that watch or used to watch peppa pig in one of the episodes about shadows the kids try to run away from their shadows they try to move faster and faster and of course failing then comes in mr elephant saying something along the lines it doesnt matter how fast you go you cant run away from your shadow at this point would just like to say that im aware that this is kids cartoon and all but in theory is it possible for example if you would be traveling at higher than speed of light without anything in your pathway and with constant source of light would the position of the shadow be offset or moving away from ones current position or do elephants actually know thing or two about physics
130996 some dictionaries define scalar as follows quantity such as mass length or speed that is completely specified by its magnitude and has no direction the free dictionary however it is my impression that in many contexts scalars can be signed in which case their magnitude their absolute value does not specify its value this definition is even used on test question here is it true that this definition is inaccurate
131014 if there is huge element of dark matter in the universe wouldnt this extra gravity prevent the accelerated expansion of the universe
131272 was studying for my exam and looking at the chapter which talks about potential energy graphs lets take this as an example my book states that if the object is in and has total energy of then it can only vibrate between the points and which makes sense because if it went beyond that would mean which is impossible because then but having read about imaginary time and quantum tunneling dont really understand the concepts though had the following thought if that would mean that have an imaginary value for my speed and since imaginary time exists that could mean has an imaginary component it made sense in my head because somewhat understand that quantum tunneling means particle can get to certain positions which their initial position and energy wouldnt allow in classical mechanics are the two at all related or is this too farfetched and totally unrelated checked wikipedia and didnt find much
131457 to find the higgs boson we had to build the biggest machine mankind has ever built the lhc with collision energy of up to tev inside the sun there is huge pressure and temperature but is the energy density high enough for higgs bosons to be created
131459 am only the equivalent of high school student so please if possible dont answer this question with anything too complex or really advanced university level am very happy to research new concepts anyone mentions but can you please keep it reasonably simple with transformer windings primary vs secondary is there any difference between or advantage to using ratio rather than ratio with ratio it would seem easier to make the wires thicker and allow for larger currents whereas with ratio to give the same cross sectional area of wire the coil would have to be much longer larger and involve more metal in production so there are obvious disadvantages to using but are there any advantages thank you very much
131487 standard phrase in popular discussions of the higgs boson is that it gives particles mass to what extent is this reasonable pop science level of description of the higgs boson and its relationship to particles masses is this phrasing completely misleading if not what would be the next level down in detail to try to explain to someone
131494 what is the relation between the lifetime of particle and the probability of decaying that particle here it says that the probability of survival is exponential if the decay process is poisson process pt frac tau however this function is not normalized so it cannot be probability distribution if the decay lifetime of particle is tau what is the probability of detection decay an time
131674 voltages are often thought of as continuous physical quantities was wondering whether by zooming in lot they are discrete feel like the answer to the above question is yes as voltages in the real world are generated by actions of electrons can someone give me more formal proof or disproof whether voltages are discrete of continuous can have some impact the correctness of devices such as the analog to digital converter for example if voltages in the real world are continuous then the buridan principle says that there cannot be perfect analog to digital converter because such device makes discrete decision from continuous inputs lamport buridan principle found phys http link springer com article s10701 it would be great if someone could also answer related question https electronics stackexchange com questions is there an adc with finite bound on measurement time
131732 while studying the heat equation got stuck in statement in my book it says we have seen that the combination of variables displaystyle frac sqrt dt is not only invariant with respect to parabolic dilations but also dimensionless it is then natural to check if there are solutions of the heat equation involving such dimensionless group it makes sense to look for solutions of the form displaystyle xt frac sqrt dt left frac sqrt dt right where is dimensionless function of single variable why is the bold text so dont see why it is intuitive to search for such solutions
131738 well lets start off with that im not physicist but id like some thoughts on something came across in my hometown this guy is it possible that due to the electrical charge of magnets this guy can make the illusion that he can float or is this probably cheap trick that fools the eye was standing there for quite some time watching the guy and he keep moving his feet the resistance that he appeared to have was from magnet force keeping him afloat so after passed this guy did some physics searches on the web and the first thing that caught my eye was the electrical charge of magnets so the question is is this related to the electrical charge of magnet or cheap trick
131812 the wikipedia defintion of shock wave pretty much sums up all ive found online about what shock wave is shock wave is type of propagating disturbance like an ordinary wave it carries energy and can propagate through medium solid liquid gas or plasma or in some cases in the absence of material medium through field such as an electromagnetic field shock waves are characterized by an abrupt nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium across shock there is always an extremely rapid rise in pressure temperature and density of the flow shock wave travels through most media at higher speed than an ordinary wave to me however this doesnt seem to provide very rigorous definition that would allow me to look at bunch of propagating disturbances and be able to clearly classify it as being shock wave or as wikipedia puts it normal wave although this definition provides qualitative definition of what sets shock wave apart from normal wave am wondering if there is definite difference between shock wave and normal waves that would allow me to definitively classify wave as one or the other or if there is continuous spectrum of wave properties between normal waves and shock waves with no clear boundary between the two like the electromagnetic spectrum with only arbitrary boundaries being drawn between the various classes of em waves
132114 in many anime comics movies etc we see lot of super human beings moving and fighting at such high speeds that regular human being cannot see that they are fighting or moving pass by in particular in the first battle between goku and piccolo those two are able to fight in confined environment when piccolo first appears in the comics stage fight if remembered correctly and regular audiences are unable to see them when they battle is it physically possible for human human size object to move in confined environment lets say text times text times text so fast that normal person would be unable to see it if it is possible how fast must this person be assume that this human cannot move faster than or even close to the speed of light some clarifications first please ignore the strength physicality of the object and consider it an object that can can move freely in this confined space without causing any side effects such as heat sounds etc second please take in note that the object is moving in confined rather small 3d space as mentioned in the question and the observer would be always able to see the entire space and last blurred image would be considered as able to see
132123 lets say we have the following wavefunction of two identical particles and frac chia psib pm psia chib phia etab pm etaa phib is this properly antisymmetric can it be put in the following form frac sqrt2 1af 2b pm 2af 1b

132372 the aharonov bohm effect shows the vector potential mathbf is more fundamental than magnetic flux density mathbf however vector potential is introduced by nabla times mathbf mathbf or mathrm mathbf mathbf which requires the poincar lemma to ensure the existence of mathbf if the manifold is not contractible there is no guarantee that mathbf exists on non contractible manifold what would happen for the aharonov bohm effect
132449 my question is it is easy to balance bicycle when it is moving at fairly high velocity say or km hr but when bicycle slows down it is hard to keep it upright and the person riding it may thus fall down why
132499 my textbook says that lorentz transformations are linear transformations and present them as matrices lorentz transformations relate different coordinate systems with each other it seems that coordinate systems are linear spaces but coordinates are just labels for spacetime points with no other structures attached so what is the linearity all about
132515 have been recently wondering if take powerful enough energy source photon and have an perfect mirror exactly in front of it and assume an emitter shot the light towards the mirror as perfect mirrors absorb no energy of any kind from photons should this mean that the perfect mirrors would never move due to transfer of momentum of the light
132566 ive been trying to design list with reasons why proper theoretical physicist should understand the methods and the difficulty of doing experimental physics so far ive only thought of two points know how theory can or cannot be verified be able to read papers based on experimental data but thats pretty much what can think of dont get me wrong think experimental physics is very hard to work on and im not trying to diminish it with my ridiculously short list truly cant think of any other reason can somebody help me
132613 the relativistic velocity addition formula is frac frac vu where velocity of projectile seen by rest observer velocity of moving observer as seen by rest observer velocity of projectile seen by now the question is this if and get an undefined answer the relavistic velocity addition formula is undefined whats wrong with setting and
132654 upon reading my book on physics it mentions that there are only two discovered types of electric charges wonder if there could be third type of elusive charge and what type of effects could it have upon matter or similarly
132719 every action has an equal and opposite reaction newtons third law if this is the case does gravity have an equal opposing force from asking around still havent got very clear answer those who ive talked to seem to believe there isnt one that gravity is actually singularity one way force which somehow just works others think it differently believing there is an opposing force of which prevents gravity from compressing masses more than it already does so which one is the right answer if either
132720 this will probably be considered very simple but am just beginner im developing software application where temperatures need to be added and subtracted some temperatures are in celsius some in kelvin know how to convert to from kelvin but how should one go about adding and subtracting these should everything be converted to celsius first for example but 15k if we put everything in kelvin we get 15k 15k 3k if we put everything in celsius we get but obviously 3k isnt equals to now you might say cant add temperature to temperatures but should be adding energy or something not sure but the reason im doing this is because we need to interpolate have collection of key value pairs like this 973k 1073k 1173k 1273k now need to get the value for so need to interpolate which means adding subtracting values hope im making sense
132754 my questions mostly concern the history of physics who found the formula for kinetic energy frac mv and how was this formula actually discovered ive recently watched leonard susskinds lecture where he proves that if you define kinetic and potential energy in this way then you can show that the total energy is conserved but that makes me wonder how anyone came to define kinetic energy in that way my guess is that someone thought along the following lines energy is conserved in the sense that when you lift something up youve done work but when you let it go back down youre basically back where you started so it seems that my work and the work of gravity just traded off but how do make the concept mathematically rigorous suppose need functions and so that the total energy is their sum and the time derivative is always zero frac de dt but where do go from here how do leap to either frac mv frac dv dt it seems to me that if you could get to either or then the rest is just algebra but do not see how to get to either of these without being told by physics professor

132892 does tire pressure measured by meter on tire gauge change with load am not interested in pressure produced by car tires onto the road car spec usually says inflate to 220kpa normal load 300kpa full load does this mean the measured pressure should be 300kpa only after the car was loaded or can one inflate the tires to the recommended 300kpa while empty and then load the car with 500kg without needing to re measure the pressure there are basically both answers to be found when researching the non physics forums on the internet one explanation says that the tire will compress under bigger load making the volume inside the tire smaller hence pressure higher it also states this is the reason why the spec plate in the car has two values you should simply expect to measure higher pressure on the tires while the car is loaded there are also explanations stating that the air does not escape from the tire hence the amount of air inside the tire is constant and the pressure measured on the tires is constant even if the car is loaded and based on observations tires normally compress when the car is loaded this would mean one needs to put more air into the tires when the car is loaded to ensure higher pressure to layman both sound feasible is one of the explanations simplifying based on normal load assumptions tire pressure does not change if car is loaded with at most 1000kg but would change if there was an enormous load put on the car where is the truth
132974 the concept of entropy is very ubiquitous we learn about its uses starting from information theory shannon entropy up to its basic definition in statistical mechanics in terms of number of micro states limiting the discussion to physics when studying physical system can be box filled with an ideal gas melt of polymers or the state of rods molecules in liquid crystalline system in all such scenarios there are specific entropic terms that we define in describing the evolution of the system by including it in the free energy expression from statistical mechanics point of view we use boltzmanns definition of ln omega where omega can be the partition function in an ensemble or simply the number of microstates within given macrostate but of course we almost never use this exact form of entropy in studying real systems as it is impossible to count the microstates by any means instead we define entropic terms based on macroscopic variables of system like the followings examples among the usual ones for perfect gas one can write the entropy per atom of atoms in volume as rm ideal ln lefta frac right with constant in soft condensed matter studying liquid crystallinity often we define an orientational entropy describing the entropy lost when molecules are oriented in its most general form defined as rm orient int theta ln thetad omega where theta is an orientation distribution function and omega small solid angle in polymers physics often there are entropic terms attributed to homogeneity in number density distribution of monomers ni along the chains often called lifshitz entropy described as rm homogeneity propto left nabla sqrt ni right which is just the gradient of density distribution in all such cases it is relatively straightforward to see as to why we refer to such state functions as entropic as they all boil down to describing certain kind of disorder in the system and how their inclusion would effect the equilibrium state of system but the underlying question is about how we give physical and mathematical bounds to these entropic terms must be consistent hence there must be set of axioms that function must fulfill in order to qualify as an entropic term to elaborate on the question on the one hand from physical point of view the entropy is always set to reach its maximum at the most disordered state and minimum for the most ordered case possible micro state complete certainty over its state for example in liquid crystals again we want rm orient to be at maximum in the orientationally disordered state the isotropic and for it to be at minimum in the completely ordered states like the smectic on the other hand mathematically we require that to be continuous at every omega to be extensive with system size differentiable does it have to be always path independent state function what else clearly if we dont know how to bound such functions based on set of axioms we cannot know if they will make sense physically and mathematically helpful thought scenario imagine studying system of particles in suspension where their positional distribution comes with certain periodicity if we are to attribute an entropic term to the state of periodicity of the system what conditions should such state function satisfy what are the axioms to be satisfied by state function for it to qualify as entropy
133032 it seems in some circles the wedge product is used in preference to curl have basic understanding of green and stokes formula wish to use the wedge notation from now on can someone tell me if this is commonly done and if so what is the underlying assumption of the surface if it is not too much to ask can someone show me how to write say maxwells equations using wedge instead of curl
133091 in this picture the acceleration vector vec points upward when the pendulum is halfway click to see animated gif but according to this picture the force acts tangentially which means the acceleration should be tangential too and never pointing upward so whats right
133198 this is definitely not an illusion as many people have the same experience have usually lived in places miles away from train stations which makes it unlikely to hear any train horns during the day however at night occasionally train horns can be heard hope if any one can explain the physics of this effect like possibly sound travels faster at low temperature
133270 unitary groups is the most mysterious thing for me when studying physics all my physics endeavor ends when author starts talking about unitary groups this is often the case because in lot of the texts or papers the author would throw terms like su3 su5 without any background motivation when you search for some more answers online you will often get purely mathematical treatment wiki article http en wikipedia org wiki special unitary group or something related to quantum field theory now remind me how many years of studying physics will one reach qft could someone qualitatively explain or provide good article that motivates the concept of unitary group with examples drawn from every day experience or basic physics could someone at least explain what an element of an unitary group physically mean
133366 have often heard it said that several problems in the theory of electromagnetism as described by maxwells equations led einstein to his theory of special relativity what exactly were these problems that einstein had in mind and how does special relativity solve them
133376 some people say that mass increases with speed some people say that the mass of an object is independent of its speed understand how some though not many things in physics are matter of interpretation based on ones definitions but cant get my head around how both can be true is any sense of the word either mass increases or it doesnt right cant we just measure it and find out which interpretation is right in some sophisticated way heat up some particles in box and measure their weight update right so ive got two identical containers each with identical amounts of water each on identical weighing scales and each in the same field if one container has hotter water will the reading on its scale be larger than the other if the answer is yes and is constant does this mean that the in mg has got bigger
133398 lets say that there are only two bodies in the universe kg each other than that the universe is completely empty no neutrons no photons no dark energy matter not even neutrinos that is to make things less complicated if the loss of other things leads to something like the universe exploding like bubble at the speed of light or something you can change these parameters im mainly concerned about gravity here those two bodies are placed apart from each other at the distance of the observable universe will they start moving into each other will they collide optional question if so with how much speed will they collide
133459 please can you help me to understand how the dimension of the set of separable states is dim cal dim cal this is the relevant passage so far we have assumed implicitly that the system is made of single component suppose system is made of two components one lives in hilbert space cal and the other in another hilbert space cal system composed of two separate components is called bipartite then the system as whole lives in hilbert space cal cal otimes cal whose general vector is written as left psi right rangle sum ij ij left 1i right rangle otimes left 2j right rangle tag where ai rangle is an orthonormal basis in cal and sum ij ij state psi rangle in cal written as tensor product of two vectors as psi rangle psi rangle otimes psi rangle psi rangle in cal is called separable state or tensor product state separable state admits classical interpretation such as the first system is in the state psi rangle while the second system is in psi rangle it is clear that the set of separable states has dimension dim cal dim cal
133494 have several confusions regarding escape velocity am sure am missing somethings obvious or maybe am taught wrong lets say we throw an object of any mass at exactly escape velocity of earth calculated from frac 2gm which is almost text km but am talking about exact escape speed that ball initially has ke frac mv and pe mgh wikipedia says and quote in physics escape velocity is the speed at which the kinetic energy plus the gravitational potential energy of an object is zero how is that possible as frac gmm no matter how much the particle travels away from earths surface it will always be accelerated towards earth with increasing the will decrease but it will never reach that means that there will be no point where the particle will stop and will continue to move with slower and slower speed will never reaches zero am right request please explain exactly what happens to particles ke and pe at different points such as at and at infty
133664 have been looking at taking the continuum limit for linear elastic rod of length modeled by series of masses each of mass connected via massless springs of spring constant the distance between each mass is delta which we use to express the total length as delta the displacement from the equilibrium position is given by phixt the discrete lagrangian in terms of the th particle mathscr is composed as follows begin equation mathscr frac sum dot phi frac sum phi phi end equation at this point we take the continuum limit such that the number of masses in the fixed length of rod tends to infinity and correspondingly the inter particle distance tends to zero it is fruitful to multiply top and bottom by delta such that we can define two quantities that remain constant during this limit namely the linear density mu delta and the elastic modulus kappa delta begin equation mathscr frac sum delta bigg frac delta bigg dot phi frac sum delta xk delta bigg frac phi phi delta bigg end equation it is easy to see why the linear density remains constant since both the number of masses per unit length increases while simultaneously the unit length decreases however my question is regarding the elastic modulus fail to see how it remains constant in this limit the argument goes as follows since the extension of the rod per unit length is directly proportional to the force exerted on the rod the elastic modulus being the constant of proportionality the force between two discreet particles is phi phi the extension of the inter particle spacing per unit length is phi phi delta therefore how kappa delta is constant its easy to relate them but why is it constant
133758 im an undergraduate student in chemistry currently studying quantum mechanics and have problem with unitary transformations here in my book it is stated that every unitary operator hat mathcal can be written in an exponential form as follows mathrm alpha hat mathcal sum infty dfrac left alpha right hat mathcal provided that have no knowledge of lie group algebra my questions are why unitary operator can be always represented by an exponential form what is the intuitive mathematical meaning of the exponential form matrix what is the relation between the operator hat mathcal and the operator hat mathcal what is its physical meaning
133866 when people describe neutrino interactions they describe them as rare infrequent due to the fact that the neutrinos are electrically neutral and have little mass if any well why then is the photon much more strongly interactive considering that it is neutral and massless what is the discrepancy between the two why is the neutrino so elusive whereas light is so prevalent does this perhaps have anything to do with the fact that neutrino is fermion whereas photon is boson
133915 was chatting with my 12yo cousin yesterday and we got to the universe its size and stuff like that then he came up with the idea ill rephrase it that the universe could basically be 4d sphere which looks like 3d but is warped into the 4th dimension so it can form 4d sphere the same way as the earth is 3d sphere which looks like 2d when you stand on it but is warped ito the 3rd dimension so it can form sphere hopefully the analogy makes sense as seem to lack the proper wording that would allow the universe to be both infinite and have its size also questions like whats beyond the edge are not meaningful anymore so it all looks very logical to him and admit to me too but am pretty sure this is incorrect as dont recall reading anything about 4th spatial dimension apart from string theory hidden dimensions but wasnt able to give him any kind of proof or counterexample so my question is is there as simple as possible explanation measurement demonstration could give show to him to disprove his idea although its obvious confess am definitely no expert so please be forgiving to my formulations and assumptions

134229 since the self energy adds to the bare mass defined in the lagrangian is it possible to create physical particle mass from the self energy alone with no mass terms occuring in the lagrangian on possibly related note wikipedia says the photon and gluon do not get mass through renormalization because gauge symmetry protects them from getting mass
134262 the quark mass term in the standard model lagrangian looks like this lambda bar phi lambda bar tau phi what is the reason for the tau factor what keeps me from writing undesirable things like lambda bar phi
134274 when we think of resistance we always think of scalar value associated with piece of material after all resistance is but resistivity times surface geometry but can resistance be directional meaning that it is stronger in one direction but weaker in another
134356 as lowly physics undergrad who has been chewing on this 2nd postulate of special relativity for year or more simply cant wrap my head around reasons why it is true or how einstein might have been convinced enough to propose this postulate consider alfred who is riding in car travelling at with his headlights on and bernard who is on the side of the road hitch hiking why does the light propagating from alfreds car move at relative to both alfred and bernard and not at relative to bernard the nifty results of special relativity all kind of hinge on this idea and asking my professors in class hasnt really yielded an answer much more than because we have never observed case otherwise
134417 since einstein name his theory special relativity and general relativity there should be some expected relationship between them particularly special relativity being special case of the more general general relativity however cant seem to relate them in anyway special relativity concerns the fact that the speed of light is universal and general relativity is mainly about the curvature of spacetime btw there is already another similar question on stackexchange reducing general relativity to special relativity in limiting case but am in for more qualitative explanation
134473 read in this answer in this site that the ke free falling ball acquires is not originated by the attracting body but that energy was actually stored in the ball when it had been lifted to the height it dropped from in this way it was said gravity is subject to the conservation of energy principle and cannot change the total energy of an object consider now the maneuver known as gravitational slingshot also gravity assist used by space probes such as the voyager space probe approaches planet with velocity slingshots around and ends up with velocity 2u where is the velocity of the planet consider the energy of the probe before it was frac mv and after it is frac mv 2u it looks like is much bigger than but where did the additional energy come from is this not violation of the conservation of energy principle
134683 want to start studying quantum mechanics and then move to quantum field theory have strong mathematical background and think this aspect of quantum physics wont be problem to me though please note that im not physicist and have taken just one short course in university about classical physics and dont know anything about it ran over the internet and saw that lot of people debate over this some say that you dont need classical physics to understand quantum physics others says you need to learn it in order to better understand quantum physics therefore thought that this is the perfect place to ask it would like to learn your opinion about this and if you think that classical physics is must or very useful for quantum physics please specify me single book possible under pages which covers all the materials that will need from classical physics
134704 im trying to think about special relativity without spoiling it by looking up the answer hope someone can offer some insight or at least tell me im wrong suppose have an ordinary clock in front of me and push it back with my hands the force applied to the clock causes it to retreat away from me and after the push it will travel away with uniform velocity suppose further can always see the clock clearly no matter how far away it is since the speed of light is constant the light coming from the clock must travel longer distance to reach my eye as it moves away this would make time appear to slow down if on the other hand the clock is moving towards me the distance the light must travel to reach my eye becomes shorter and shorter thus time would appear to speed up
134705 when you attach bolt to something using nut it is clear what the roles of the nut and bold are the more you tighten the bolt the more secure your fastening however you are often also told to use washer as well know this somehow prevents the bolt from loosening but from physics mathematics point of view what is the role of the washer
134831 the force of inertia is the property common to all bodies that remain in their state either at rest or in motion unless some external cause is introduced to make them alter this state that is the definition by jean dalembert in the encyclopedia he explains this is lost in the bad translation from french that he used property and not power because he believes that this word evokes metaphysical being resident in the body sic sort of poltergeist and this is the original wording by newton in definition iii materiae vis insita internal resident lit implanted force est potentia resistendi qua corpus unumquodque quantum in se est perseverat in statu suo vel quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum the introduction in italics the internal force of matter is the power to resist is prodromic to the first law see below but what is interesting is the explanation thereof given haec semper proportionalis est suo corpori neque differt quicquam ab inertia massae nisi in modo concipiendi per inertiam materiae fit ut corpus omne de statu suo vel quiescendi vel movendi difficulter deturbetur unde etiam vis insita nomine significantissimo vis inertiae dici possit this internal force is always proportional to its body and is not different in any way from the inertia of its mass but for our way of conceiving it it is because of the inertia of matter that it is more difficult to alter the state of body of being at rest or in motion therefore this internal force may also by called by the most significant name of force of inertia lex corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum nisi quatenus viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare law every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly in straight line unless it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed motive force impressed vi motrici impressae is also the denomination of the esternal force that produces kinetic energy in the second law as you can see from the original texts by newton and dalembert there is no difference whatsoever between inertia sloth and force of inertia this latter denomination is sort of promotion to higher status of conception the laziness of mass matter is proportional to mass and is the power that opposes change it is an internal force the force of laziness inactivity of all matter in the original post quoted verbatim this latter definition from the principia and pointed out the amusing oxymoron this was taken as hostile sic unclear by hasty superficial or poorly informed readers andas nonsensical babble sic by olin lathrop all the arguments to criticize this question to condemn it as unclear to close it eventually delete it altogether and differ its reopening seem rather unjustified hair splitting and themselves really incomprehensible am striving to reopen it as matter of principle because distinguished member rod vance has repeatedly stated in comments alas deleted that he has very interesting answer also want an opportunity to learn what exactly is my nonsensical babble and to learn how to make this question clear and comprehensible hoping the worthy members who inexplicably ostracized this question and btw the downvoters to explain what is wrong with this question is the concept of force of inertia still useful and used is it now just one of the fictitious forces or what can you list few situations in which if we didnt use this tool we might be in difficulty it is possible that the two terms have acquired in use different meanings of which am not aware some might wrongly assume that moment of inertia is different concept from force of inertia or other are you asking about inertia in general or just the term force of inertia please edit the question and title accordingly using parenthesis force of inertia is ambivalent qmechanic is this semantic linguistic question about the term force of inertia as opposed to the terms fictitious force pseudo force or inertial force qmechanic suppose that after these authoritative comments fourth additional question is necessary what is the physics difference between inertia force of inertia and inertial force it would be of great interest for everybody suppose to learn when and how the to terms diverged and if they have different fate left the parenthesis because am enquiring about both terms
134843 currently am doing research into visible light communication from an embedded systems background msc but am struggling to relate the concepts of modulation of radio to visible light already apply modulation to working vlc system but the underlying system still puzzles me my goal of this post is to create an understanding of the underlying fundamental concepts so if there are flaws in my assumptions below please point me to it radio in rf communication two modulation techniques are used amplitude modulation and frequency modulation all other modulation techniques are variations on these types these modulation techniques change the electromagnetic field in terms of coherent photons with specific frequency and amplitude source visible light communication in vlc amplitude modulation is the most common technique changing the intensity but frequency modulation is also used as frequency relates to color some research uses rgb leds to do this in combination with color filtered photodiodes however and this is where the problem is some research applies frequency and phase modulation using single white led they use photodiode as receiver which is sensitive to intensity but not to color variations so how is frequency modulation then possible it seems that vlc has third kind of main modulation technique in comparison with rf is this correct if so what makes light so different from rf then as it also is electromagnetic radiation and can this third type be applied to rf
134849 according to various sources on the web it seems like the general concensus is that there isnt actually any wave particle duality with quantum particles for example this article implies that diffraction patterns in double slit experiments were interpreted as wave interference due to apparatus limitation at the time they were first performed does this mean that all those sources and animations showing two waves interfering are simply incorrect classical conclusions which dont have anything to do with quantum reality whats actually the most confusing is that most sites which state that it is now possible to pass individual photons through these slits also claim that these individual photons somehow interfere with themselves resulting in the observed patterns that seems like rather thin explanation doesnt it so is there actually any need to use wave interference to explain the phenomena or can we simply state that the pattern is probabilistic in certain way without involving the spooky explanations
134943 this scene youtube link from the movie the team the four members are in the tank and its falling from the air they fire the canon and it slows the tank from falling for moment before falling again is this possible from physics point of view am looking at this from recoil point of view can the tank firing the rocket produce enough recoil for it to counter the force of gravity

135063 suppose have an object with mass in vacuum that propel by applying constant force on it with rocket engine that supply constant amount of energy frac delta supply delta to then the objects acceleration is given by ma implies frac thus it will have constant increase in velocity frac delta delta but frac mv and so the objects increase in energy equals frac delta object delta frac frac delta delta mv frac delta delta mva this energy increase frac delta object delta is not constant but frac delta supply delta is and so the principle of conservation of energy is violated where is my error edit many of you point out that the problem lies in how assume rocket will convert my energy to constant force bms for example says that frac dk dx instead of frac dk dt but there is one thing about that dont understand imagine that instead of rocket propel my object with an electron accelerator accelerate my electrons over an electric potential of volts and aim the beam opposite to the direction of desired travel this will consume constant amount of power since iv power equals current times voltage and the rate of electron ejection current can be kept constant this should mean that that all my electrons are ejected with the same velocity relative to my object at the time of ejection shouldnt it or does frac dk dx make this statement invalid and since the electrons should require known force to be accelerated to and because of newtons third law every force has an equal and opposite force shouldnt this apply constant force on my object
135180 crossed my mind after random rant on wikipedia that lead me to articles about chronometers and measuring position lets assume were trapped in the underground laboratory with lots of equipment but without any access to the surface would be able to properly determine my position latitude longitude and altitude and if so what instruments are needed and mny whats the coolest way to do it thought about measuring coriolis effect which could lead to latitude measurement and earths gravity map could give more hints but its still far too imprecise
135186 there is massive debate raging about whether the wavefunction is an aspect of reality or just way of handling the data you have about system this question is in that vein local unitary on qubit is an operator on two dimensional hilbert space for which there exists an adjoint dagger such that dagger suppose you have an entagled pair of qubits next suppose you perform uniformly random local unitary which you have no knowledge of on one of the qubits does this destroy the entanglement would say that the entanglement is destroyed if the value tr rho ln rho departs from its original value of say towards rho is the density matrix of the qubit note my first guess is that for states like this psi rangle rangle the von neumann entropy is if you apply random unitary to any one qubit you are just randomizing an already completely random state so there is no effect so no you cannot destroy the entanglement with random local unitary
135346 im not exactly an expert in quantum physics but this seems to be simple question and cant find an answer anywhere there are specific types of fields used in physics scalar fields as in the case of the higgs boson vector fields as in magnetic fields tensor fields as in general relativity etc but what types of fields are used in qft to model elementary particles is my confusion simply result of me thinking in purely classical terms

135477 can we add any two vectors if not why is that so think this is not true but am not sure my book says it is true but guess it is misprint for example adding acceleration to velocity
135478 it occurs to me though im hardly the first that the decay mu to bar nu nu mu should be forbidden in electron degenerate matter since there must be an empty state available to receive the electron how would one take this fact to make an order of magnitude estimate of the equilibrium muon density at the core of white dwarf star technical answers and illuminating references are welcome
135520 saw on perhaps cosmos and have heard mention from other professors that electrons sort of teleport or something in their orbital and the quantum level so looking at the orbitals for lone hydrogen atom source deviantart net some of those orbitals have or more blobs that are separated from each other by some gap theres some discontinuity take for example that orbital in that image where there are two blobs and gap in between how does the electron jump from place to another how do you describe whats happening here
135521 when an electron is moving around in its orbital is it actually moving around like wave like this video shows by wave like mean the electron in this video is showing it following predictable wave like path which would mean you could precisely determine its position which obviously you cant or instead does it just have some probability to be in that orbitals space and just randomly jumps around from one point to another or if not that how does the electron move around in its orbital
135539 understand heat as the flow of energy through radiation convection or conduction from one body to another when think about conduction for example visualize particles that jiggle lot bouncing against particles that jiggle less and transferring heat to them progressively thus with this collisions and change in momentum delta over period of time delta we have force and displacement of particles as the formula of work is defined as times why cant we consider heat the same as work at the atomic level if this kind of work is not what we define as heat why dont we take this kind of energy into consideration when it comes to use the formula of internal energy

136477 in some media mass carrying particles can go faster than light cherenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when charged particle passes through dielectric medium at speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium how does this happen would imagine that light faces the least resistance to motion and that other charged mass carriers have more stuff to impede their speed why are the particles allowed to exceed the speed of light for other media when they are not allowed to in vacuum
136486 its classic question with many answers all over the internet but none here so figured id ask it how fast would the earth need to spin for person or anything for that matter to feel weightless while on the surface at the equator in this situation everything on the earths surface would essentially be in orbit around the earth at the radius of the earths surface let us assume the atmosphere was also spun up to this angular velocity so there would be no air drag slowing things down let us also say by surface of the earth we mean mean sea level you can decide for yourself if how to factor in the bulge of the earth you can assume that the earth somehow is able to maintain its present shape while spinning up any comments on whether an earth spinning slightly faster than this speed will cause it to break apart or not will also be appreciated
136542 would be little more restrained with the existence of antineutrons first at all if understood right the existence of antiquarks is hypothetical if one not agree with this please refer to experimental data which shows their observation second one has to show that the neutron is not able to decay in electron neutron and anti neutrino as well as in the anti particles if one will use the isospin he has to go back in history and to explain how and why the isospin was discovered or was he invented third neutron antineutron collision after all what we have seen in this kind of collisions with protons antiprotons and electrons positrons has to lead to pure energy in the form of photons did we get this data in some experiment

136724 as the title asks how close can you get to lava before burning know that it depends on an number of factors speed of lava flow wind direction strength type of lava flow related to speed in part think im guessing it also depends on the person and what theyre wearing id be looking for an actual distance preferably something could calculate if know the above but general rules would work as well note the general rule of just dont go near lava in the first place has already been taken into account this question is partially inspired by movies games that show characters near lava where there should be enough heat without actually touching it to simply burst their garments into flames
136752 am suddenly struck by the question of whether gravitation affects magnetism in some way on the other hand gravity is weak force but magnetism seems to be strong force so would magnetism affect gravity or do they ignore each other being forces which do not interact the answer to this is related to this question if the earths core were to cool so that it were no longer liquid no longer rotated and thus produced no magnetic field would this do anything to earths gravity
136775 is any matrix tensor in special relativity my question is inspired by the definition of the electromagnetic field tensor in carrolls spacetime and geometry book in equation he defines matrix which he says is the electromagnetic field tensor in section he states the maxwell equations in tensor notation and additionally states that in this form they manifestly transform as tensors assume that this is due to the tensorial nature of the electromagnetic field tensor however dont understand why it is tensor would we have to prove that the electromagnetic field tensor transforms as tensor by brute calculation alternatively is there some clever and more obvious shorthand that you could use to come to the same realization

137122 feel this question has an obvious answer that should have been able to find independently but ive searched for while now it hasnt clicked when position is measured the uncertainty of the resulting delta spikes position is and the momentum of the particle determined by its wavelength has therefore infinite uncertainty alternatively sigma infty and sigma after measuring momentum wouldnt each of these give the uncertainty relation begin align sigma sigma geq frac hbar infty geq frac hbar end align does times infty even make sense is it just defined to be geq frac hbar here so the uncertainty principle is obeyed the usual application of the uncertainty principle as far as know is as constraint before measurement is actually made with respect to the variation in the expectation values of observables once youve made measurement does the uncertainty principle simply no longer apply
137207 in this article it says the electrons can only orbit stably without radiating in certain orbits called by bohr the stationary orbits at certain discrete set of distances from the nucleus these orbits are associated with definite energies and are also called energy shells or energy levels in these orbits the electrons acceleration does not result in radiation and energy loss as required by classical electromagnetics the bohr model of an atom was based upon plancks quantum theory of radiation my question is how can this be if it is actually impossible any accelerating point charge should emit radiation as explained here for example it is not like can posit the existence of an orbit where the electron is stable just out of mid air what am missing here
137221 the question is the well known olbers paradox if there are so many infinite stars in every direction why is it dark at night where goes all the light we dont see discussing with friend we found different answers the first my friends answer is that given the fact that in finite amount of time in this case the age of the universe light can travel only certain finite distance we cannot see if they actually exist stars farther than such distance about billions of years guess then he states or better got him notice he implicitly does this that within this radius there arent enough stars to fill the night sky and thats why we have darkness without suns light the second answer mine or anyway the one heard from minutephysics youtube video is that despite of the big size of the observable universe cosmological expansion red shifts most of the light out of the visible radiation range so that the majority of light cant be seen by our eyes at night while if we use for example an infrared camera we should see brighter sky and lenghtening more and more the wavelength at which we observe the sky we come to the uniform background radiation so my question is what is the right answer is it one of the above mentioned or even third one edit ive seen both answer may be acceptable but what is the main contributing phenomenon

137504 computers generate heat when they work is it result of information processing or friction resistance are these just different ways to describe the same thing or does some definite part of the heat come from each explanation often read that its necessary byproduct of information processing there are irreversible operations such as and gates and the remaining information goes to heat but so many other things generate heat as well light bulb electric hotplates gears etc these probably dont process information the way the computer does but may be wrong from physical perspective earlier had always assumed the computer is like this as well it basically has small wires in the processor and the resistance could explain the heat maybe these are parallel explanations the information processing aspect may say that there has to be some heat as byproduct in some way in any realization of an abstract computer and the friction aspect could then describe how this actually happens in this concrete wires and transistors type physical implementation of the abstract computer but maybe the two explanations account for separate amounts of the heat or maybe one accounts for subset of the other again in partially parallel explanation way can someone clarify

137560 im afraid this question is going to sound rather dumb but here it is suppose have very simple circuit one battery and one resistor the sum of the voltages in this circuit has to equal zero my question is how does the resistor know how much voltage drop to provide how is it that it always manages accommodate voltage drop that exactly equals to voltage provided by the battery because of ir can see that if the resistance is kept constant then the current flowing across the resistor will increase or decrease according to the voltage drop needed but how and why does this accommodation occur
137811 it is well known that tied weight will oscilate under the effect of gravity if left from aside like pendulum however if we tie helium balloon to the ground from and left it form the floor not exactly from where it is tied but from side it will go upwards until the string is not loose without oscilation why is this like that how is the force of the helium pulling up different from the gravity pulling down in the pendulum example

138095 lately ive been brushing up on some of my old physics texts from college most recently ive been rereading parts of classical dynamics of particles and systems 5th ed by thornton and marion in the second chapter the authors discuss newtons laws of motion and point out about the third law that we must hasten to add however that the third law is not general law of nature the law does apply when the force exerted by one point object on another point object is directed along the line connecting the objects such forces are called central forces pg know that gravity and the electrical attraction between static charges are central forces and so know that these forces certainly obey newtons third law however aside from briefly mentioning that velocity dependent forces do not generally follow the third law the authors do not elaborate so my question is two fold first is newtons third law not universally true it was my understanding the the third law was necessary consequence of the homogeneity of space and conservation of momentum second what would be familiar example of non relativistic force that does not follow the third law am correct in understanding that drag would not necessarily follow the third law because the magnitude of the force is velocity dependent

138297 from wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki mass inertial mass measures an objects resistance to being accelerated by force represented by the relationship ma active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted by an object passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force experienced by an object in known gravitational field mass energy measures the total amount of energy contained within body using mc for all mass measurements we are actually measuring its force and dividing it by the gravitational acceleration the current devices for measuring mass be it weighing scale mass balance etc all works by measuring the force rather than the mass since is assumed to be constant alpha as for the mass energy measurements it is difficult to measure the total amount of energy as it comprises many factors which is why delta tells us more than the total energy even for measuring the mass of celestial objects such as the moon the newton law of gravitation is used which also measures the force and applying the equation to obtain its mass are there any methods or devices that directly measure the mass without measuring the force and manipulating it to get the mass

138770 was reading griffiths introduction to electrodynamics specifically the section on plane waves can see that if we want transverse wave traveling in the direction that we are only going to want our waves to have and components but the reasoning in griffiths left me confused we start with electric and magnetic field waves of the form ezt ikz omega bzt ikz omega since we are in free space we have that nabla cdot nabla cdot now comes the crucial step griffiths claims that these two facts immediately imply that wasnt sure how this followed know that if want my waves to be planar that need the and derivates of the fields to be so that have constant magnitude over front of constant phase but wasnt sure how to see that derivative had to be zero as well it seems that if you had an electric field plane wave whose real part was varying in space as sine function that if you were to look at its derivative that you would get cosine function
138892 how do quantum fields evolve in time heisenberg picture how does time evolution relate to the equations of motion ve had this understanding that there is duality between classical and quantum fields take the fourier transform of classical field multiply it by creation operators and then fourier transform back to get corresponding quantum field now here is my picture of time evolution we evolve quantum field by going to its corresponding classical field evolve the classical field via the equations of motion and then find the corresponding quantum field keep in mind that this is all using the creation operators of the free field however in many qft textbooks the correspondence between quantum and classical fields is function of time this is because the creation operators are function of time so my picture of time evolution is wrong in some way what is the correct picture ve had this idea of how to remedy the situation if hat mathbf dagger is the quantum field corresponding to the classical field varphi mathbf mathbf cdot mathbf then hat mathbf daggert is the quantum field corresponding to the classical field varphi mathbf where varphi mathbf is obtained by applying the equations of motion to the classical field varphi mathbf that is hat mathbf daggert is just hat mathbf dagger evolved in time in the sense according to my picture of time evolution because of the superposition principle this would validate my picture of time evolution because all fields can be represented by their fourier transforms and time evolution is linear if this is also wrong then how else can the equations of motion of classical field dictate the evolution of quantum field

139067 imagine an aeroplane travelling with velocity at some angle alpha from east to north box is dropped from the aeroplane what would the projectile of the box be would it be parabola with an initial component of velocity acting upwards or would it travel as downward curve with an initial component of velocity acting downwards my reasons for thinking both parabolic projection my explanation for this would be that the box will have the same initial components of velocity as the aeroplane at the time it is dropped since the aeroplane has component of velocity acting upwards and an component of velocity it would travel in parabola as in conventional projectile motion downward curve by downward curve mean curve with negative gradient increasing in magnitude my explanation for this would be that as soon at it is let go the only force acting on the box would be its weight and hence it couldnt travel upwards as well as this when visualise in my head box being dropped from an aeroplane cant imagine its possible to travel in diagonally upward direction once its been let go can someone explain to me which type of motion it has and why

139346 why does the air pressure at the surface of the earth resulting from collisions of molecules on the surface of the earth which has to do with the velocity of the particles exactly equal the weight of the entire air column above it which just has to do with the number and mass of the molecules in the air column here are the beliefs that give rise to my perplexity the weight of the atmosphere is the mass of the molecules in column with cross section square inch lets say times the force of gravity thus if we cooled the air column to the point where it was solid and set the solid on scale we would get the weight of that column of air which am told should read lbs the pressure from the air on patch of ground square inch in area is due to the collisions of the air molecules with that patch of ground this is function of the number of particles hitting the ground per unit time which is itself function of the density of the air at the ground and the average kinetic energy of those molecules their temperature the air pressure am told is lbs square inch if enclose some the air at the ground in rigid container say screw the cap on to glass jar on the ground thus isolating it from the effects of the column of air above the pressure of the gas inside the jar is psi and would remain that assuming the container doesnt change shape volume and keep it at the same temperature even if took it too the top of mountain or in to space the molecules of air are sufficiently far apart so that inter molecular forces are negligible so why does the air pressure at the surface of the earth resulting from collisions of molecules on the surface of the earth which has to do with the density and velocity of the particles exactly equal the weight of the entire air column above it which just has to do with the number and mass of the molecules in the air column

140927 you can start fire by focusing the sunlight using the magnifying glass searched the web whether you can do the same using moonlight and found this and this the first two in google search results what found is the thermodynamics argument you cannot heat anything to higher temperature using black body radiation than the black body itself and moon isnt hot enough it may be true but my gut feelings protest the larger your aperture is the more light you collect also you have better focus because the airy disk is smaller so if you have really huge lens with really short focus to keep moons picture small or in the extreme case you build dyson sphere around the moon letting small hole to the let the sunlight enter and focusing all reflected light into point it should be more than enough to ingnite piece of paper isnt it im confused so can you start fires using the moon

141158 in the top answer to the question why do we use root mean square rms values when talking about ac voltage the following was stated this rms is mathematical quantity used in many math fields used to compare both alternating and direct currents or voltage in other words as an example the rms value of ac current is the direct current which when passed through resistor for given period of time would produce the same heat as that produced by alternating current when passed through the same resistor for the same time by waffles crazy peanut the rms value specifically applied to sinusoidal voltage source mathrm is given by mathrm rms mathrm over sqrt here is where my intuition conflicts where it probably goes off id imagine the average voltage that would be felt direction insignificant absolute value by the circuit would equate to the true average value of the voltage which is given by integrating half period and dividing by the length of the period the mathematical procedure of finding the average height of function over given interval the avg voltage it seems to me should be given by the equation mathrm avg 2v mathrm over know that the two conversion coefficients are close but simply cannot see why the rms value is the one that conforms to reality please enlighten me

141303 its kind of tricky concept assume on one side you got those neat shared vertices of sio2 on the other water you dont really have shared vertices only kinda but they still want to align themselves but what truly defines glass is the existence of an alternative form crystal that doesnt have time to form during the solidification due to high viscosity and stuff is ice the true crystal if not its glass right
141331 was talking to someone about trying to dissipate the most heat from metal crucible essentially just resistor he argued that you wanted the resistor to have high resistance because 2r so propto but thought back to messing around with resistors and batteries where remember that if attached much lower resistance to battery it would begin to heat up much faster than bigger resistor this also makes sense in the context of the power law because iv and so so propto and smaller resistor dissipates more heat the conclusion came to is that in the first scenario the machine in question supplies current and that current is driven across the resistor so its appropriate to use however in the second scenario is set and is determined by from there is that correct
141354 what is the motivation for complexifying lie algebra in quantum mechanical angular momentum the commutation relations xj ij quad yj ij quad zj ij become on complexifying arbitrarily defining pm pm ij 2j quad zj pm pm 2j and then everything magically works in quantum mechanics this complexification is done for the lorentz group also as well as in the conformal algebra there should be unified reason for doing this in all cases explaining why it works further some way to predict the answers once you do this without even doing it though was told by famous physicist there is no motivation
141468 in general what is meant by non linear system in classical mechanics does it always concern the differential equations one ends up with any examples would be greatly appreciated if so is it considered as non linear because of higher powers of system variables 2x or does also any function of makes the system non linear like cosx lnx etc am confused furthermore why is it that most non linear systems are considered non integrable is it due to this fact that such systems are usually considered to be unpredictable even classically because we cant have exact analytical solutions
141802 how is antimatter made in laboratory can anyone explain at the particle level specifically how anti protons and anti electrons are made
141839 if earth assembled out of space dust how come we find heavy elements like gold silver uranium and bunch of others that are heavier than iron on the surface mean silicon si mass being the crust makes perfect sense as it is lighter than iron fe mass shouldnt heavy elements been sank by gravity to the bottom of the earth when it was only starting to become planet billion years ago
141856 many sources state that the earths gravity is stronger at the poles than the equator for two reasons the centrifugal force cancels out the gravitational force minimally more so at the equator than at the poles the poles are closer to the center due to the equatorial bulge and thus have stronger gravitational field understood the first point but not the second one shouldnt the gravitational force at the equator be greater as there is more mass pulling the body perpendicular to the tangent since there is more mass aligned along this axis
141865 my understanding is that when it comes to forming white dwarf it is the electron degeneracy pressure due to the pauli exclusion principle preventing collapse in of the white dwarf if the gravitational force is sufficiently large then the electrons in the white dwarf will be forced to fuse with the protons to form neutrons and the neutron star resists collapse in by neutron degeneracy pressure if the gravitational force is even greater then black hole will form how does the pauli exclusion principle actually create force it seems to me from various things have read that the force due to the pauli exclusion principle increases as the fermions are squeezed closer together although am not sure why there is an increasing force and it is not simply the case that the fermions cannot be pushed into exactly the same position it is as if the fermions know when they are approaching each other
141875 how do we estimate the mass of single star guess we need the luminosity the surface temperature radius distance etc but we know nothing about the reality because we can measure the real gravitational forces by only single star the sun how can we know that the models weve created are good
141898 naturally know it to be true that the moon goes around the earth and that the earth goes around the sun however attempting to picture this has confused me bit why doesnt the moon just get left behind ill draw diagram to show what im imagining what id expect to happen after this image is the earth to move along while having its direction of motion changed due to the gravitational force with the sun and the moon to move along while having its direction of motion changed due to the gravitational force with the earth my slight issue and where think might be missing something is why doesnt the earths speed just mean it can just fly away from the moon and just leave it flying in its tangential velocity know im missing something here so if anyone could point that out itd be greatly appreciated sorry if it seems obvious ive thought along the lines that the moon might also be following the earths orbit of the sun but the law of universal gravitation would as far as know stop that being true since its of differing mass edit alternatively why doesnt the earth just smash into the moon
142005 sun is generating energy by nuclear fusion and nuclear fusion will emit energy in the form of gamma rays normally earths ozone filtering the ultraviolet radiation and magnetic fields of earth deflecting the cosmic rayscharged particles but what kind of natural system protecting us from suns gamma ray as it is main product of nuclear fusion note as we know gamma ray can be blocked by denser materials like several meters of thick lead pb
142061 looking at the comments of this questions does the gravitino contribute to the gravitational interaction and even considering that the answers here in this other question why are all force particles bosons do explain why force carrier needs to be bosonic still wonder if there are some particular cases where fermion similar to gaugino could mediate force case in mind that could avoid the issues on angular momentum conservation is zero range interactions contact interactions still can not see how such beast could be described with lorentz invariant lagrangian
142132 could cherenkov radiation be used for general illumination for example to replace leds light bulbs etc are there or could there be methods to produce substantial amount visible light with cherenkov radiation using devices compact and cheap enough safely and energy efficiently to actually make any sense what other problems could there be for using cherenkov radiation for this purpose
142159 since newtons law of gravitation can be gotten out of einsteins field equatons as an approximation was wondering whether the same applies for the electromagnetic force being the exchange of photons is there an equation governing the force from the exchange of photons are there any links which would show how the coulomb force comes out of the equations for photon exchange know that my question is somewhat similar to the one posted here the exchange of photons gives rise to the electromagnetic force but it doesnt really have an answer to my question specifically thank you in advance
142169 the schr dinger equation is the basis to understanding quantum mechanics but how can one derive it asked my instructor but he told me that it came from the experience of schr dinger and his experiments my question is can one derive the schr dinger equation mathematically
142193 something moving faster than light should have imaginary mass like photons have zero mass and thus travel at have read this article of physicist george sudarshan he said taking mass to be imaginary we get real energy and momentum think have understood that however if something moves at speed greater than its proper time tau sqrt becomes imaginary where is coordinate time does this imply causality violation does imaginary time mean time is going backward
142236 im currently going over some undergraduate exams on particle physics and im having problems with specific reaction namely pi to sigma which in my opinion is not allowed due to strangeness violation rightarrow so it could only be weak interaction since its purely hadronic though it should be strong interaction can anyone explain to me where im wrong or is the professors answer wrong he marked the not allowed answer with wrong no further explanation
142344 im sure many here are familiar with the following image showing the 2d representation of how the fabric of spacetime is warped by the presence of mass can this fabric be interpreted as an elasticated sheet if so imagine the following massive entities for example black holes as these are said to cause gravitational waves when they collide rapidly rotating about their barycentre on this sheet would have certain displacement between the neutral position of the sheet no mass placed on it and the barycentre when these entities collide assume that the displacement of the centre of mass of this new entity on the sheet would be larger than the initial displacement because the pressure exerted on the sheet would be larger owing to the same constant system mass being concentrated on smaller region of the sheet now say this collision between the initial massive entities happened quickly this sudden change in displacement would cause the centre of mass hence the sheet to oscillate remember im saying that the sheet is elasticated thus creating ripples that travel across the fabric of spacetime gravitational waves is this complete and utter nonsense if so can those with wisdom please provide an explanation analogy of how they are formed and possibly or if indeed necessary tell me where my analogy is wrong apologise in advance for the terrible illustrations
142352 when parachute slows the velocity of an object where does the energy go if its falling object the acceleration from gravity is roughly constant how does air drag dissipate the extra energy
142413 my professor in qft did move which cannot follow given the state hat phi rangle int frac 3p pi dagger mu mu rangle he wanted to show that this state is an eigenstate of the position operator therefore he applied the position operator in the momentum representation which is hat mu frac partial partial mu then miracle for me appears as he interchanges the derivative and the integral hat hence gets hat mu hat phi rangle hat mu int frac 3p pi dagger mu mu frac partial partial mu int frac 3p pi dagger mu mu mu hat phi rangle cannot see why he is allowed to interchange the integral and the derivative
142435 jupiters moon io is heated through the gravitational pull of jupiter but when io is heated because of this where does that energy come from how does conservation of energy work for this effect where is energy lost
142531 heard this theory yesterday if something is not moving in space then it is moving on the time axis at the speed of light realize that in essence there is no object which can be considered as not moving in space so my question is rather theoretical given an object with zero velocity on all three axises is it moving on the time axis at the speed of light does the law of conservation of energy or any other law in physics imply that this condition must hold
142548 the hamiltonian left begin array cccc end array right commutes with the qubit exchange operator left begin array cccc end array right so would expect the two to have the same eigenvectors the eigenvectors of are easily seen to be the latter two are also eigenvectors of but the first two are not why thought commuting operators shared the same eigenbasis
142672 given scattering event where photon and electron go in and photon and electron come out what is the center of mass frame id say since the photon has no mass its the rest frame of the incoming electron
142732 from what understand of the idea behind hendo hoverboards they use four disc shaped hover engines to generate self propelling motion also understand that it uses lenzs law and eddy currents and that the hendo hoverboards only work in non ferromagnetic material from what re call lenzs law states that eddy currents are created when magnets are moved relative to conductive materials in particular lenzs law states that eddy currents are formed when there is change in magnetic flux so they used magnetic field architecture magnetic field architecture mfa is design where there are electromagnets on the base of the board that propels on non ferromagnetic material however dont understand how that works how do they calculate the gravitational pull such that the mfa exerts more force to over come that gravitational pull
142805 am trying to intuitively understand why pi is used when calculating the value of using the harmonic motion of pendulum frac pi 2l does it have something to do with the curvature am thinking something along the lines of that aswell as the fact that the oscillation of pendulum would follow circular path the squared value of it would be because it was performed in 3d space am just looking for mathematically intuitive understanding of this
142971 recently played crysis game where the protagonist wears suit that allows the player to hide both himself and his heat signature then watched iron man where kid suggests that tony stark should have implemented retro reflection panels in his suit so im thinking well as is the nature of things people are going to be pursuing this sort of thing in real life too pretty soon but im trying to figure out whether suit can contain persons heat signature without emitting the heat somewhere is such thing fundamentally possible to do without over heating the person within
143256 all of you are sure to be familiar with these two equation frac at and overline vt given the same initial and final velocities and time and acceleration with the second equation need not use the acceleration but the distance found using these equations are different for this who say that the second equation assume it isnt always true use the formula for graphs of uniformly accelerated motion to find the distance travelled at the end of certain time use initial and final velocities to find the average velocity and multiply the velocity by the time in second on the graph wait just tested another uniformly accelerated motion problem with both formulas the result are the same what this is only for some specific problems
143385 whats so special about the speed of light why do many equations in physics include the speed of light in vacuum why do so many thing depend upon it why cant it be the speed of sound or as matter of fact any other variable for example in mass energy equivalence mc why the speed of light
143576 we usually heard that speed of light in vacuum remains same no matter how observer is moving am wondering whether is it taken as postulate or proven phenomenon that is constant irrespective of observers speed
143593 use an ordinary syringe to generate single water droplet however it is not usually able to make droplet smaller than mm because of surface tension forces inner diameter of needle etc since need finer droplets around mm for some of my experiments manufactured piezoelectric drop generator using nozzle swissjewel sp with orifice inner diameter of mm made from sapphire fig and anticipated to generate droplets in the range of to mm figure sp sapphire nozzle however when very small droplet forms on the tip of sp it does not fall down it remains on the tip feeds more water to become larger and then falls down therefore finally have droplets around mm diameter not smaller what should do in order to generate finer droplets should coat the tip with superhydrophobic material or have any other option thanks in advance
143630 previously thought this is universal theorem for one can prove it in the one dimensional case using variational principal however today im doing homework considering potential like this vr quadr vr quadr and found that there is no bound state when 0a pi hbar 8m so whats the condition that we have at least one bound state for 3d and 2d

143843 in equation in peskin and schroeder they write out the generating function but leave out all quadratic terms of the form phi hat phi arguing that they vanish since fourier components of different wavelengths are orthogonal but then my question is why doesnt the same argument apply to terms of the form phi hat phi which they include here hat phi begin cases phik hspace 1cm text for lambda leq lvert rvert lambda hspace 55cm text otherwise end cases where is some fraction but if im not totally wrong if phi hat phi vanish then so should phi hat phi by the same argument right if not why not
143978 im interested if any of the following explanations have enough predictive capability to explain the observations we see today the claim is that the universe is not expanding and that red shift of light is caused by though couple of these are simply ridiculous im still interested keep in mind that am not creationist but am looking for reasons to see if any of these are valid or invalid
143998 why do helicopter blades make this pulsing oscilating slapping sound since their movement is smooth shouldnt the sound be similar constant shush perhaps increasing or decreasing in frequency as the speed of the blades changes update wont the sound heard depend on the location of the listener perhaps person standing below or above the helicopter would hear more constant and uniform sound wave while listener standing to the side will hear the mentioned pulsing sound
144078 when star starts to run out of hydrogen to fuse it begins to collapse due to gravity until the central core temperature rises to text then due the force generated by the fusion of helium the star expands again and becomes red giant so why doesnt the expansion cool the core
144101 we know all that the gravitational constant is times mathrm kg but can we calculate it theoretically
144294 all the introductions ive found to pauli matrices so far simply state them and then start using them accompanying descriptions of their meaning seem frustratingly incomplete at least cant understand pauli matrices after reading them at all my current understanding and confusion is demonstrated below id be ever so grateful if someone could fill in all the holes or poke new ones where appropriate spinors looks like column vectors left begin matrix end matrix right and are used so that rotation in three dimensions using complex numbers can be linearly transformed what does the example spinor above mean spin value of in the and directions how can spin frac be represented with just 1s then three dimensional vector is used to construct the pauli matrix for each dimension for spin frac the vectors used for and are and you transform them each to the relevant pauli matrix by the following equation using dimension for demonstration left begin matrix end matrix right where superscript denotes dimension not power once you have these matrices you operate on the spinors with them what does this do you can also find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the matrix which can be used to find the probability that particle if measured to have certain spin in one dimension when measured next will have spin in another dimension that you choose dont understand how this works what does the eigenvalue and eigenvector in this sense physically represent and how does spin up and down fit into this if you had spin particle that you knew was spin up in the direction what would you do to find the probability of it having spin up or down in the or dimension when next measured concrete examples would probably help my understanding lot
144329 understand the basic idea of nuclear fission put bunch of fissionable material together and let the neutrons fly an atom gets split kicking out few more neutrons which split other atoms which release more neutrons and then you have chain reaction nuclear reactors also have control rods which you stick down into the fuel to absorb neutrons to slow the reaction down or withdraw to speed the reaction up but thats the part thats never made any sense to me if neutrons travel from the nucleus of one atom to the nucleus of nearby atom to split it and perpetuate the chain reaction doesnt that take place within the fuel itself on an atomic scale how can inserting macroscopic object nearby affect this process in any way by the time the neutron gets out of the fuel to the point where it can strike the control rod and be absorbed by it isnt it out of the fuel by that point and not going to cause any more chain reactions anyway so what do the control rods actually do that affects the rate of the reaction
144337 according to the documentary particle fever the precise value of the higgs bosons mass could give more credence to either susy or multiverse theories if the mass had been gev or below susy would have been favored whereas mass above gev would have given preference to multiverse is there way to understand this connection how can the mass of particle give input to the likelihood of particular physical theory and or in particular the two discussed here im especially interested in graduate level but qualitative explanation though any level would be great note physics se question discusses higgs susy and multiverse but does not give an explanatory answer for the connection
144356 ive only had very brief introduction to lagrangian mechanics in physics course took last year we briefly covered the principle of stationary action we looked at it derived some equations of motion with it and moved on while the lecturer often referred to it as the principle of least action he always reminded us that it wasnt actually least action but stationary action minimum maximum or point of inflexion rather than just minimum he never however gave an example of system where we didnt seek the least action why is it then the principle of stationary action instead of least action what is an example of system which we would seek maximum instead of minimum
144393 say it is winter and the outside temperature is degrees set my thermostat to degrees when the temperature inside my home reaches degrees the furnace will kick on and warm the house to now if set my thermostat to degrees to save energy when my house reaches degrees the furnace will kick on and warm the house to in both instances the same amount of energy was expended to raise the temperature by degrees so how is it that keeping your thermostat at will save energy
144406 on wikipedia saw that the average orbital speed of planet earth around the sun is whopping text and it made me wonder are there bodies planets meteorites asteroids that move faster my question is not about small photons or other small ish particles and their speed speed of light or even about solar winds text km but about meteorites planets or other materials and their speed around the sun or other fixed point
144546 know newtons third law of motion might be the answer for this but still am wondering how the rockets could thrust in the empty space and move in the opposite direction guess an astronaut wouldnt be able to push in the empty space with his hands or legs to move himself but with rocket engine its possible how what might be the explanation for this in general relativity
144572 know there are say two different definitions representations of the covariant derivative one is the covariant derivative applied to vector which reads as df partial iaf adapted to the coordinate system of course rightarrow mu and so on whereas an other one applies to matrix and reads as df partial left af right where this time commutator appears in both case is the gauge potential whereas the are not the same of course wonder if there is link between these two representations and what kind of use they have know about the first representation could someone tell me if the name representation is even well adapted but clearly the second one does not lead to the usual definition of the gauge field say alpha beta left alpha beta right so im pretty much struggling to understand if it has geometric interpretation most of all what are the different names of these two representations if one can use this terminology good references about that are warmly welcomed
144641 the equation for capacitance is cv or over dont understand what is the physical meaning of this does the charge in system changes linearly with voltage under all circumstances wouldnt it be more comfortable to define electrostatic energy storage capability of capacitor or any other system in terms of max possible charge max related question why does the area of the plates affect the capacitance
144694 what is the most efficient way to store data that is currently hypothesized is it theoretically possible to store more than one bit per atom until floris comment hadnt considered that efficiency is dependent on what youre trying to optimize when wrote the question had matter efficiency in mind are there other orthogonal dimensions that one may want to optimize and to be clear by matter efficiency mean representing the most data presumably bits with the least amount of matter
144696 have plastic scintillator had purchased off ebay which is believed to be bc408 http www phys ufl edu courses phy4803l group muon bicron bc400 pdf upon shining small uv led 40ma maybe 400nm wavelength on it it seems to glow mostly from the refraction of the plastic or how it was milled and the uv beam itself rather than appearing to fluoresce such as the beam just bouncing off imperfections and passing through the bar had also tried to point it at an old crt screen as test because believe they generate near xray levels or is that kept behind leaded glass and saw nothing interesting how can cause the scintillator to glow observe flashes with objects one can source around the house or easily would need higher energy uv at less energy to make the fluorescent effect more dominant than the light hitting it and reflecting off itself
144736 have read different speeds of earth in different sources rm km rm rm rm and even rm km rm basically its moving too fast around the sun and the solar system is moving too so why dont we feel it and why doesnt it harm us in any way inertia can only be part of it but whats the whole reason
144779 heard climatologist on talk show saying that one of the widely known arguments used by climate scientists to exemplify what runaway greenhouse effect could cause to earths temperature and climate comparison with venus atmosphere is basically farce he argued that venus high surface temperature which is over is caused mainly by its high surface pressure which is over 90x greater than earths and that the so called greenhouse effect contribution to this temperature was negligible or simply non existent he mentioned the ideal gas law in order to prove his argument saying that temperature grows proportionally with pressure which of course is true for an ideal gas and this pretty much settled his train of thought this made me wonder and im trying to come up with reasoning that debunks his argument at first thought one could not simply apply the ideal gas law to venus atmosphere since the molar density at the surface is too high and that one should use more terms of the virial expansion to account for the behavior of the pressure near the surface however even if that is true his argument remains undisputed since the leading term of the expansion is still the ideal gas term then realized his oversight may have been the cause effect relationship he tried to establish between pressure and temperature as matter of fact an equation of state doesnt tell us anything about causality it only states the relationship between different state variables that describe system this takes us back to my question is it the really the high pressure of venus at surface the agent responsible for its high surface temperature or is it the other way around or maybe even mix of the two to better clarify my thinking imagine this if we take venus and place it out of the solar system where its exposure to solar radiation would be negligible think we can agree that its temperature would decrease drastically now know most of its atmosphere would solidify in such conditions but the thing is would the pressure on the same layer of matter where the surface of the planet was previously remain the same no so does this tells us that it is the temperature of the planet that determines its pressure on the other hand am also aware that the pressure at the surface is simply function of how much matter gas there is above it no clear connection with temperature here ive reached this crossroads and cant seem to establish any clear causality relationship between pressure and temperature am going in the right direction or is it that am just plain wrong and the climatologist correct when he made his assertion
144819 suppose an empty universe with the exception of single hydrogen atom proton electron the electron may be in its ground state or it may be excited certain number of levels suppose it is at level pick some reasonable measure of size the average distance of the electron to the proton or the radius of the sphere surrounding the proton which would with sufficiently high probability contain the electron if some other definition of size is easier to compute id be happy to use that instead how does this size grow with was inspired by this question about the bekestein bound in particular jerry schirmers suggestion to store the information in single atom ive seen this idea thrown around before but never properly analyzed it in particular the bound seems to place weak limits on just how close the electron could be to the proton in highly excited state though perhaps the high escape chance of the electron plays havoc with the bound
145110 if the speed of light is always constant then light should escape from black hole because if directed radially outwards it only needs to travel finite distance to escape and at speed of it will do this in finite time since light cannot escape from the black hole that means the speed of light must be less than near the black hole how can black hole reduce lights speed
145158 ive just been watching doco where some guys cut hole in frozen lake the ice is feet thick was surprised that the water rose to the level of the ice my friend assures me its because water equalises levels with ice in the same way it equalises with itself is this right or is there another reason for the water rising to the same level as the surface of the ice

145458 the problem statement of bells spaceship paradox is this two spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other they are connected by string the string is strong but it cannot withstand an arbitrary amount of stretching at given instant the spaceships simultaneously with respect to their initial inertial frame start accelerating along the direction of the line between them with the same acceleration assume they bought identical engines from the same store and they put them on the same setting will the string eventually break and the solution is here http www physics harvard edu uploads files undergrad probweek sol11 pdf the very first statement made in the solution to this problem is to an observer in the original rest frame the spaceships stay the same distance apart but why do they stay the same distance apart to an observer in the original rest frame shouldnt the distance between the spaceships undergo length contraction as they are connected by rope asked similar question here and the answer that got was that length contraction only applies to situations where you have system with two ends that are moving at the same velocity and you know the distance between these ends in the frame where they are at rest and want to know the distance between them at any given instant in some other frame where they are moving at velocity along the axis joining the two ends well the two ends of the rope are moving at the same velocity know the distance between them at frame when they are at rest and do want to know the distance between them at any given instant when they are moving at velocity along the axis joining the two ends how then can make the statement that for an observer in the rest frame that the spaceships stay the same distance apart

145772 in the sense of copenhagen interpretation what exactly is an interpretation what purpose does an interpretation serve can an interpretation be tested or even be correct or incorrect independent of the underlying theory being interpreted why do physicists publish them this topic is currently dominating another question of mine why does the copenhagen interpretation assert randomness if this cannot be tested this question is proper place for those arguments this is not subjective question please no opinions what do the authors of these interpretations understand them to be try to cite sources
145811 is our knowledge of physics complete enough to achieve fully natural simulations of molecular interactions in computer simulation how far off are we reason for question wonder how far we are from simulating cells in computer assume that this would be possible once we have complete models for physical and chemical interactions once we can simulate cells in computer and run hundreds of experiments simultaneously our knowledge of cell biology could start to increase very rapidly allowing us to for example discover medical cures faster
146003 in popular physics articles and even some physics classes ive been to the vacuum of space is described as being constantly full of quantum fluctuations supposedly all sorts of particle antiparticle pairs at all scales are constantly appearing and disappearing we end up with mental image of the vacuum as roiling choppy sea with all sorts of things going on rather than calm placid background however the vacuum being the lowest energy state of theory should be an energy eigenstate which means it is time invariant except for physically irrelevant phase factor so it seems the vacuum really should not be seen as dynamic entity with all kinds of stuff happening in it as were led to believe jess riedel wrote in blog post that vacuum fluctuation is when the ground state of system is measured in basis that does not include the ground state it merely special case of quantum fluctuation so it sounds as if the existence of vacuum fluctuations is contingent on measuring the vacuum in particular measuring something that doesnt commute with energy such as guess the value of field at point how much truth is there to the idea that vacuum fluctuations are constantly happening everywhere all the time is that really useful way to think about it or just myth that has been propagated by popularizations of physics
146010 am platform diver am trying to figure out how deep in the water go depending on which platform dive from the platforms are 1m 3m 5m 5m and 10m above the water surface by ignoring air resistance we assume that do not do any tricks can easily compute the energy that my kg body has when it is hitting the water mgh 5mv my problem is to find the deceleration in water and thus how deep my feet will go into the water before coming to halt we can assume that stand straight and fall straight down and have height of 190cm how do compute that
146166 what would happen if we decided to build giant ring that managed to wrap around the whole world end to end that was supported with pillars all along the ring and then the supports all suddenly removed would the ring float in place or if it fell what direction would it fall
146253 we know sound wave is disturbance that moves through medium when particles of the medium set neighboring particles in motion and using the pressure variations we can plot pressure time graph which looks like wavein the drawing sense what do we mean when we say light is wave and particles using the above system can we say that light is the disturbance that moves through medium of photons forgive me that makes no sense when we draw light wave what does it mean photon goes up and down please keep the answer as not complicated math as possible
146499 for example the four velocity transforms as lambda nu nu the faradaytensor as ab lambda mu lambda nu mu nu or in matrixnotation lambda lambda where lambda is the transpose of the matrix but the lorentz matrix lambda mu nu is not tensor does lambda transform anyway like second rank tensor in the same way like the faradaytensor
146585 as study jackson am getting really confused with some of its key definitions here is what am getting confused at when we substituted the electric field and magnetic field in terms of the scalar and vector potential in the inhomogeneous maxwells equations we got two coupled inhomogeneous wave equations in terms of mathbf and phi so the book states that to uncouple them which definitely makes our equations simpler to solve we introduced gauge transformations as adding gradient to mathbf and adding constant to phi would not affect their meaning my question is which one is gauge and why in the expression for gauge transformation mathbf mathbf nabla gamma somewhere in the internet read that gamma is gauge function so is gamma gauge if yes then why basically what is gauge
146666 so am inside coach in train that is fully sealed with no windows and locked door have torch photo time sensor and scale with me so place the sensor at one of the walls and stand distance from it at switch on the torch and measure the amount of time it takes for the light to reach the photosensor if the time it took light is frac then know that the train was stationary if it takes more time than that say then know the train was moving and the light actually travelled distance of times and the extra distance it travelled is times say in time frac and can know the speed of the train as train frac this would mean that measured the speed of the train independent of any frame of reference now where did go wrong

146871 elasticity is one the most intriguing phenomena wiki gives summary explanation of what happens in steel spring the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied energy is added to the system when forces are removed the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state could you explain in detail how potential energy is actually stored in steel spring and why the material never surrenders to the bending forces taking new shape update it would be interesting if someone might add some technical details is the quantity of energy transformed into heat during the compression equal to that lost during the release is the heat loss during the two phases due to the exactly same causes process how do you minimize heat loss one factor is surely the mass what is the max value of the ratio between energy spent in the compression and the energy retrieved gamma read it can be what determines the ratio between energy retrieved and velocity of rebound cr what is the max cr achieved to date in spring and with what material choosing the right material can the speed of relaxation ever increase with the deflection in such way to allow an elastic collisions
146931 for instance if there was galaxy assume it to be made up of antimatter isolated from other normal galaxies how would we or rather would we be able to distinguish if it was made up of matter or antimatter if not then why is not considered that half of the universe out there might be made up of antimatter but we think there is an abundance of matter over antimatter just because we cant detect any difference among the two are there any cases in which antiparticles act differently than their corresponding particles would
146984 why was the michelson and not the fabry perot interferometer used to detect the motion of earth relative to the aether maybe the fabry perot was used but we all know that the most famous experiment was made with the michelson interferometer so are there features of the michelson interferometer that makes it better than the fabry perot one in this kind of experiment know that the fringe shift in both cases is propto frac lv lambda where is the distance between the mirrors and is earths speed relative to the aether in others words the experiment would lead to the same result in both cases apart by constant factor so this makes me think that michelson interferometer has something special in comparison with the fabry perot one
146993 still reading classical mechanics by goldstein im struggling on very basic notion angular momentum physically understand it as the momentum of an object rotating around something given certain position however cant give physical explanation to the formula why do we multiply the linear momentum by the position why does the angular momentum is function of the position
147070 why were random variations introduced in the spherically symmetric universe after big bang which made it non symmetrical since the outcome of coin toss depend on factors such as torque applied air resistance etc by the same logic spherically symmetric universe should have been symmetrical and the outcomes of quantum processes should have been also same on both the opposite ends
147096 there is no action at distance in nature attraction of piece of iron by magnet attraction between distant electric charges of opposite sign have to be mediated by something the virtual particles are proposed as an explanation if they have an observable effect it seems like they must exist if so why do we call them virtual it cant be that they have short lifetimes as there are short lived particles resonances that we dont call virtual on the other hand some people say that the so called virtual particles only exist on paper or that they are just technique to help us handle our equations so what is the meaning of the word virtual here do these particles really exist or not
147239 lets say persons hair was on fire and suddenly we instantaneously pumped all the air out of the sealed room then after time period we put all the air back is there an such that we will put out the fire and it wont start again but we wont kill the person whats the approximate value of
147346 this idea came to me while playing kerbal space program noticed that the larger my parachute was the slower my rocket would fall back down to kerbin would like to know if it is possible to create parachute so large in the real world that it might stop all velocity essentially making whatever is attached to it float in mid air common sense is telling me no but could always be wrong and would love some explanation behind whether or not it is possible
147433 the metrology world is currently in the middle of overhauling the definitions of the si units to reflect the recent technological advances that enable us to get much more precise values for the fundamental constants of nature than were possible when the si was drawn up this has already happened to the second and the meter which are defined in terms of caesium transition and the speed of light and it is being extended to the other units thus in the new system known as the new si four of the si base units namely the kilogram the ampere the kelvin and the mole will be redefined in terms of invariants of nature the new definitions will be based on fixed numerical values of the planck constant the elementary charge the boltzmann constant and the avogadro constant respectively the proposed draft of the si brochure gives more details but it stops short of describing the recommended mises en pratique for example for the kilogram the definition goes the si unit of mass the kilogram the kilogram symbol kg is the si unit of mass its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the planck constant to be exactly when it is expressed in the si unit for action kg m2 thus we have the exact relation kg m2 inverting this equation gives an exact expression for the kilogram in terms of the three defining constants delta nu 133cshfs and mathrm kg left frac times10 right mathrm mathrm ldots times frac delta nu left mathrm cs right mathrm hfs the planck constant is constant of nature whose value may be expressed as the product of number and the unit joule second where kg m2 the effect of this definition is to define the unit kg m2 the unit of both the physical quantities action and angular momentum and thus together with the definitions of the second and the metre this leads to definition of the unit of mass expressed in terms of the value of the planck constant note that macroscopic masses can be measured in terms of using the josephson and quantum hall effects together with the watt balance apparatus or in terms of the mass of silicon atom which is accurately known in terms of using the ray crystal density approach however the brochure is pretty scant as to what the specific realizations through watt balances actually imply in terms of route from measured physical quantities to values of fundamental constants or to inferred masses for the specific case of the watt balance for example the physical constants at play are much more naturally the josephson and von klitzing constants 2e and if understand correctly so there is some re shuffling of experimental results to be done the si brochure is similarly vague for the other three base unit fundamental constant pairs this brings me then to my specific questions for each of these four base unit fundamental constant pairs what are the proposed experimental realizations what are the basics of their operation and what physical effects do they rely on what other fundamental constants are used to go from experimentally measured values to inferred parameters the meter depends on the second does the kilogram depend on the value of the electric charge what specific natural constants are measured by the experiment and how are they reshuffled to obtain final results additionally what is the dependency tree between the different definitions of the base units what units depend on what others either directly or indirectly
147499 it is known that there are no diproton or dineutron nuclei does this mean that two protons or neutrons are not actually attracted to each other even if the attraction was weak wouldnt it cause bound states anyway related what do we know about the interactions between the protons and neutrons in nucleus
147539 on the question why certain velocities phase velocity can be greater than the speed of light people will say something like since no matter or information is transferred therefore the law of relativity is not violated what does information mean exactly in this context it may help to consider the following scenarios if laser is swept across distant object the spot of laser light can easily be made to move across the object at speed greater than similarly shadow projected onto distant object can be made to move across the object faster than in neither case does the light travel from the source to the object faster than nor does any information travel faster than light read more https www physicsforums com threads phase velocity and group velocity

147847 in reference to the findings talked about here http online wsj com articles two new subatomic particles found using large hadron collider scientists say and other similar articles describing these and other subatomic particles what role do such newly discovered particles play in the standard model physics in general what does the discovery mean for physics with the higgs boson there was an immediate problem of sorts or fact more accurately which was proven when it was discovered but with these particles there is nothing that appears to be as sensational
147893 what is it that quarks are actually made of will they decay into this substance as the up and down quarks are the lightest type of quark do they not decay was thinking that if this could happen there must be lighter quarks in response to the comment know that they dont exist on their own but quark must surely decay at some point into what makes them up so wanted to know if they decay what do they decay into and if they do not what are quarks made of

147939 imagine negatively charged conductor in vacuum the excess electrons will be spread out over the surface such that the net electric field inside the conductor is zero what keeps these extra electrons bound to the conductor for the case of neutral conductor could intuitively understand some sort of coulomb force being responsible but for negatively charged conductor dont understand what net positive entity is exerting the attractive force is there an explanation based only on classical electrodynamics say at the level of jackson if not is the explanation purely quantum mechanical basically how does one model this phenomenon
147987 im bit confused about this following issue concerning representations of su2 denote by the dimensional representation of the group su2 the spin similarly denote by and the dimensional spin and dimensional spin representations respectively also denote by jj the representation of su2 times su2 given by the tensor product of the representation with the representation by addition of angular momentum we know that where the sign denotes the direct product of two representations but since and both represent the same group su2 so does their direct sum reducible representation it follows that is representation of both su2 and su2 times su2 am correct
148028 after reading many questions like this and this wonder is it possible to consider also the other fundamental forces the electroweak interaction and the strong interaction or ultimately the unification of these to be fictitious forces like gravity in the framework of general relativity if we want final unification of all fundamental forces hasnt this feature of gravity to become feature of the other forces as well
148116 my question is regarding vector space and lie algebra why is it that whenever read advanced physics texts always hear about lie algebra what does it mean to endow vector space with lie algebra im assuming it is the same lie from the lie groups my current knowledge is that the lie groups are to do with rotations of molecules im not after lots of detail but would like basic understanding of what this means and why it is such prevalent idea
148177 im trying to understand quantum physics im pretty familiar with it but cant decide what counts as observing to cause particle behave at least when its about lights so the question is what do we see with our eye balls we point laser or any kind of light source to the wall we see its way from point to do see particle or wave lets see an average object it pretty much looks like their pieces observing that influences their behave does this means while were watching light it acts like particle in quantum level
148189 while studying photoelectric in my school my teacher drew graph of current versus the potential difference across the two electrodes am not able to understand why do we get saturation current know that at saturation current all the electrons emitted from the metal surface are able to reach the other electrode my question is suppose we increase the potential difference between the two electrodes further think that one of the following two things should happen current may increase as now the electrons in the wire will be under greater potential difference thereby reducing the time in which the electrons complete one round to reach the same point again and hence increasing current ir current may not be continuous steady current might not be achieved as the time taken by the photoelectrons to reach the positive electrode may be more than the time taken by the electrons inside the wire to go from end of the wire nearer to the positive electrode to the other end so in no case should we get graph as shown in the link it may be that have not understood the photoelectric effect completely if that is the case please tell me where am wrong
148203 what is the main difference between astronomy astrophysics and cosmology have the impression that astronomy is subject that runs parallel to physics but it is outside the physics field this is based on the division of departments present in many universities the department of physics being separated from the department of astronomy the difference between cosmology and astrophysics is more obscure to me have the impression though that cosmology is more concerned with the structure of spacetime and universe models while astrophysics is more concerned with stellar life cycles physical properties of stars galaxies etc which is the field that had more activity scientific breakthroughs recently in real life are those classifications even important are there many differences between the education process of future astronomer astrophysicist or cosmologist somebody please give examples of famous astrophysicists cosmologists and astronomers at the present time
148216 was in argument with someone who claims that length contraction is not real but only apparent that the measurement of solid rod in its rest reference frame is the real length of the rod and all other measurements are somehow just artificial and apparent seemed to me like bad conversation about poorly defined words and not really relevant to physics but then some quotes were offered so that the back appears closer to the front but of course nothing has happened to the rod itself rindler the effects are apparent that is caused by the motion in the same sense that proper quantities have not changed resnick halliday at the same time the iep entry on sr insists that length contraction and time dilation are real with observable consequences time and space dilation are often referred to as perspective effects in discussions of str objects and processes are said to look shorter or longer when viewed in one inertial frame rather than in another it is common to regard this effect as purely conventional feature which merely reflects conventional choice of reference frame but this is rather misleading because time and space dilation are very real physical effects and they lead to completely different types of physical predictions than classical physics however this does not mean that time and space dilation are not real effects they are displayed in other situations where there is no ambiguity one example is the twins paradox where proper time slows down in an absolute way for moving twin and there are equally real physical effects resulting from space dilation it is just that these effects cannot be used to determine an absolute frame of rest went through lot of einstein minkowski and lorentz original material and didnt find anything about what is real and what is not finally know about muons where the effects of sr seem to be very real from wikipedia but had seen it in physics class before when cosmic ray proton impacts atomic nuclei in the upper atmosphere pions are created these decay within relatively short distance meters into muons their preferred decay product and muon neutrinos the muons from these high energy cosmic rays generally continue in about the same direction as the original proton at velocity near the speed of light although their lifetime without relativistic effects would allow half survival distance of only about ln2 at most as seen from earth the time dilation effect of special relativity from the viewpoint of the earth allows cosmic ray secondary muons to survive the flight to the earths surface since in the earth frame the muons have longer half life due to their velocity from the viewpoint inertial frame of the muon on the other hand it is the length contraction effect of special relativity which allows this penetration since in the muon frame its lifetime is unaffected but the length contraction causes distances through the atmosphere and earth to be far shorter than these distances in the earth rest frame both effects are equally valid ways of explaining the fast muons unusual survival over distances so which is which why do rindler resnick halliday use the word apparent
148298 have been looking for this for quite some time now simple pendulum behaves in shm lets put that pendulum in an upward accelerating elevator the component of the force that acts in shm text mg sin theta still stays the same in my head however websites and books tell me to use mg sin theta where is the acceleration of the elevator tried to look up free body diagrams but cant find any for the case of accelerating frames can someone explicitly prove this without using the flimsy argument of think its noninertial frame with new effective
148309 from what know of newtonian mechanics if an object is moving at constant velocity the net force acting on that object is equal to zero if there is friction then the applied force required to maintain constant velocity is equal to the magnitude of the force of friction regardless of the actual value of the velocity now lets suppose car is driving on road at constant velocity of km and the force of friction acting on the car has magnitude of the applied force from the engines required to maintain the speed is also therefore as the net force is equal to zero if the car travels on the same road at constant speed of km again it would require the same amount of applied force from the engines to maintain the speed without acceleration as this cancels out the force of friction and per newtons second law the velocity does not change if moving at two different constant speeds km and km on the same surface requires the same constant applied force generated from the engines then why does moving at km use up more gasoline
148337 understand from the internet that the higgs particle is highly unstable it decays as soon as it is created if it is so unstable how one can say that the higgs field exist just like if photons are unstable there wont be electromagnetic field cannot imagine field whose particle is highly unstable also it is said that the mass depends up on how the matter interact with this higgs field if the higgs bosons are highly unstable how matter can interact with those unstable higgs bosons
148378 to get product state of two states phi rangle and psi rangle we use kronecker product phi rangle otimes psi rangle instead of kronecker product otimes can we use cartesian product or any other products available in literature but we do not do so here kronecker product is more efficient than any other products my question is why kronecker product any physical reasoning or any problem in mathematical formulation for which kronecker product is so important the founders of quantum physics did not form it as they wished definitely they got some ideas that convinced them the efficiency of kronecker product what were them asked the question at my very first class of quantum information theory till now did not get any satisfactory answer but the course is going to be finished thank you for your help
148418 according to the wikipedia page on galaxy types there are four main kinds of galaxies spirals as the name implies these look like huge spinning spirals with curved arms branching out ellipticals look like big disk of stars and other matter lenticulars those that are somewhere in between the above two irregulars galaxies that lack any sort of defined shape or form pretty much everything else now from what can tell these all appear to be 2d that is each galaxys shape appears to be confined within some sort of invisible plane but why couldnt galaxy take more 3d form so why arent there spherical galaxies ie the stars and other objects are distributed within 3d sphere more or less even across all axes or if there are why arent they more common
148489 my question is is it possible to make laser beams viable midair without smoke thought it would be great idea to have second smartphone or pc screen without having solid screen the reason why it has to be without smoke is that smoke would be too dependent on the environment if it is possible to make laser beams appear in some way midair without smoke just air would this be possible am not sure if its possible with two lasers collide or some other way wouter

148656 in comment to rob jeffries answer to this question on spherical galaxies incnis mrsi commented there should exist the entire range of orbits in spherically symmetric system near circular highly excentric but not elliptical because galatic orbits are not keplerian why shouldnt the orbits of stars be keplerian can think of few reasons but dont know if theyre correct the influence of dark matter interactions with gas and dust in the galactic arms are either of these explanations correct
148676 in the text im using for qm one of the properties listed for hilbert space that is mystery to me is the property that it is separable quoted from text zettili quantum mechanics concepts and applications there exists cauchy sequence psi epsilon such that for every psi of and varepsilon there exists at least one psi of the sequence for which psi psi varepsilon im having very hard time deciphering what this exactly means from my initial research this is basically demonstrating that hilbert space admits countable orthonormal bases how does this fact follow from the above and what exactly is the importance of having countable orthonormal basis to the formalism of qm what would be the implications if hilbert space did not admit countable orthonormal basis for example
148709 am high school student who has just started reading elementary electromagnetism and am completely beginner in this subject have read in books that em waves are nothing but sinusoidal oscillations of electric fields and simultaneous sinusoidal oscillations of the induced magnetic field which is obvious as predicted by the maxwells law of induction that propagate through space at the speed of light also have come to know that an uncharged conducting shell immersed in an external electric field as predicted by the gauss law of electricity will not permit the external electric field lines to enter into the shell and act as the so called faraday cage this is where something struck me as absurd if immerse conducting shell in sinusoidally varying and propagating external electric field then as the field disturbance reaches the shell it would in no way penetrate inside it to affect the interior of the shell and the field inside the shell will remain null but that means the em waves cannot enter the shell interior doesnt it everything goes wrong here transparent conducting shell is mere paradox where has my reasoning gone wrong what is the source of my great misconception could find no satisfactory answer in the internet an elementary explanation is needed for as said earlier am complete novice and want to clear my beginner level misconceptions
148761 this question comes from someone who is interested in physics but with no theoretical background in epr presented the thought experiment which later came to be known and quantum entanglement understand that the thought experiment reflects the bizarre conclusions of quantum theory observation of state of particle at one place would let that observer know the state of the correlated particle light years away even without observing it and since quantum theory says that the state of particle is always in fuzzy state unless you observe it this implies that the other particle is getting affected without even observing it hence spooky action at distance which doesnt quite fit with traditional newtonian physics the epr theory as thought experiment is quite understandable to me what do not understand is why did scientists decades later build tunnels of several kilometers and sent two entangled particles to each end and then measure the state of those particles to ascertain quantum entanglement mean what were they expecting were they expecting the states of the particles to be not in co relation how would they explain for that as far as have understood the epr experiment was thought experiment that kind of throws quantum theory in an uncomfortable position but its an experiment that cannot be disproven co relates are co relates it just puts the philosophy of quantum mechanics to doubt and you cannot communicate information through entanglement anyway so my question again why the experiments ps please if possible provide me with relevant links to learn more about this topic dont trust random blogs on the net and the wikipedia article is just difficult to understand
149065 understand that in given system with no external torques applied angular momentum is conserved however consider the following situation lets say the earth revolves around the sun in circle my reference point will be one point on the circle when the earth is say on the other side of the circle from my reference point the angular momentum is non zero however at the point when the earth crosses my reference point the angular momentum is zero since angular momentum is position cross momentum and the position with respect to my reference point is zero but thought it was conserved is there some external torque im forgetting to include thanks ahead of time for any answers
149082 it is well known that geodesics on some manifold covered by some coordinates mu say with riemannian metric can be obtained by an action principle let be curve mathbb to mus be an affine parametrization of using same symbol for coordinates and parametrization here but its standard the action yielding geodesics is int cl ds where equiv sqrt mu nu dot mu dot nu now the popular text by nakahara makes the claim that variation of equiv frac will yield the exact same action principle solutions however the reference above only shows that solves euler lagrange equation for implies solves euler lagrange equation for and this can be shown through direct brute force computation my question is the converse of the above true and how does one go about proving it in particular how do we show that yields no extraneous solutions to the euler lagrange equations
149214 it seems that the only condition used in proving that the carnot engine is the most efficient is that it is reversible more specifically the carnot engine can be run in reverse as refrigerator furthermore it is asserted that all reversible engines will have the same efficiency however isnt any closed loop on pv diagram reversible the arrows can simply be drawn in the reverse way to create refrigerator if any closed loop is reversible then why does the specific carnot engine specific loop have the highest efficiency
149314 everyone who deals with screws and screwdrivers knows that long screwdrivers are stronger than short ones however cant find any relationship between length of screwdriver and mechanical advantage for wrench its obvious long arms produce more torque but in case of screwdriver it is not so simple for this question my point is not originally about screwdrivers im actually going to design simple machine that has relatively long arm connected to an electric motor its intuitive that the long arm weakens the motor or maybe im wrong the answer of my question about screwdrivers will help me undrestand the mechanism behind this case and solve the problem
149487 you have likely read in books that tides are mainly caused by the moon when the moon is high in the sky it pulls the water on the earth upward and high tide happens there is some similar effect causing low tides they also say that the sun does the same as well but has smaller effect compared to the moon heres my question why is the moon the major cause of tides why not the sun the sun is extremely massive compared to the moon one might say well the sun is much farther than the moon but ive got simple answer just substitute those numbers in frac gm and find gravitational acceleration for the moon and then for the sun on earth by the way youll find something around for the moon and for the sun double checked it to make sure as you can see the sun pulls about times stronger on the earth can anyone explain this thanks is advance
149516 can someone explain simply what are adus was reading this post here http www qsimaging com blog understanding gain on ccd camera however still dont quite understand this statement gain on ccd camera represents the conversion factor from electrons into digital counts or analog digital units adus gain is expressed as the number of electrons that get converted into digital number or electrons per adu adu it seems adu is digital number but what is that the units of adu is counts but what are those counts they are not electrons it seems then what are they time im sorry if this is silly but just cant comprehend what adus physically are it really stumped me from understanding the rest of the article

150009 in physics the planewave ansatz meaning an educated solution guess is very ubiquitously used when solving differential equations in different domains of physics to solve the dispersion relation of magnons or phonons in solids also very commonly in qm in semiclassical approximations and so on the examples above all correspond to systems of 2nd order linear differential equation my question is the use of the planewave ansatz purely motivated by mathematical reasons form type of differential equation knowing that planewaves dont really exist in reality as they would require infinite propagation how is it that it still remains theoretically suited ansatz most often for describing physical phenomena phonons to propagate to infinity surely guess this last question could be formulated differently in which cases one can be sure that planewave ansatz type solution would absolutely fail

150139 am trying to learn physics by myself as do not have good teacher at school ive been reading feynman lectures on physics and cant figure out how he found out this number here is an excerpt of the book let us now illustrate the energy principle with more complicated problem the screw jack shown in fig handle inches long is used to turn the screw which has threads to the inch we would like to know how much force would be needed at the handle to lift one ton pounds if we want to lift the ton one inch say then we must turn the handle around ten times when it goes around once it goes approximately inches the handle must thus travel inches and if we used various pulleys etc we would be lifting our one ton with an unknown smaller weight applied to the end of the handle so we find out that is about pounds this is result of the conservation of energy if you divide pounds by in you get frac which is number close enough to pounds which according to feynman is the weight that we need to apply to the end of the handle believe however that this calculation is wrong given dimensional analysis of such operation here is my dimensional analysis frac pounds in inches frac and this is wrong as we are suppose to get force not mass found this website where you can find what think is an email from an student reporting the teacher that he believes he got the number diving frac pi can you also explain me this finally in thread in physics forum questionthey concluded that is just the force to keep the system at equilibrium and you need text force to actually lift the ton after someone said that feynman would have said this answer is wrong why is that

150387 im software maths guy who would like to build physical setup for generating quantum random numbers have no physics background so bear with me background the project is for public exhibit so its important to me that the setup should look cool or at least interesting and should reveal something about how it works api calls to qrng on the internet wouldnt serve that purpose it also need to be safe to have around people albeit perhaps in glass case or whatever dont have big budget or any physics or engineering skills so need something that doesnt require much skill or specialist equipment to build dont mind learning on the job though and might be able to enlist the help of physicist further down the line dont actually need the numbers generated to exhibit true randomness and expect larger scale effects temperature vibration etc will interfere with the quantum ones but do want to be able to honestly say that photon emission times or whatever are influencing the results my very rough understanding is that this can be done by pointing laser at photocell the resistance of the cell ought to vary slightly as the number of photons arriving varies so if my software asks the photocell for its current value and looks at the last few digits of that value in theory the fluctuations ought to have quantum origin questions is the setup ive described feasible and likely to work with low cost components if its not can you suggest another approach if it is how would find out what strength of laser and sensitivity of photocell need to get the effect that is how big is the fluctuation in power what other technical things do need to consider note inevitably this question is mixture of physics and engineering im primarily looking for invalidation of the general approach here and will take specific engineering questions elsewhere if necessary im hoping perhaps in vain that with good definition of the physics the engineering part can be accomplished by assembling few stock components
150446 in studying general relativity many text deals with the derivation of schwarzschild metric starting from generic metric form after that impose static spherical symmetry and obtain the desired schwarzschild metric but havent find any reference for above process in kerr metric add condition of rotation in many textbooks on general relativity and black hole textbook they just state the form of kerr metric and do some calculation is there any reference textbook or paper contain explicit derivation of kerr metric

150503 moment ago was emptying bottles filled with water liters that are on the terrace of my house as did so remembered something saw on tv some time ago dont remember when or where or exactly what but made move on the horizontal plane as if the bottle drew circle several times to my surprise after several laps vortex was formed and the bottle did empty in half the time than those that are simply put upside down repeated the experiment times to be sure and always got the same results bottle upside down seconds approx bottle upside down and rotation to form vortex seconds approx clearly the vortex allows air to enter the bottle faster than in the other case would like to understand what happens in physical terms edit another interesting fact is that in the first seconds just the first liter is gone and in just two seconds after the vortex is formed the remaining water goes fast very fast

150687 was under the impression that the falloff of various forces were because of the way the area of expanding sphere scales but that strict falloff would only be globally true in strictly euclidean geometry yes so if you had an electron and positron in warped space due to gravity wouldnt that term in coulombs law end up needing to be adjusted because of the warping of space leading to an increase or decrease in effect due to gravitational lensing or scattering found one related question here does gravity warp coulombs force but it only has one down voted and unclear answer
150803 assume system described by hamiltonian and assume that the eigenstates of are integrable in absolute square we say that these states belong to hilbert space they can even form base in that space but is the opposite true let system be described by wave function sr integrable in absolute square does that imply that the system behavior is also described by hamiltonian remark te evolution of system does not always admit hamiltonian if the evolution is non unitary or at least if there is hamiltonian it would take complex eigenvalues to be clear dont know if my system evolves unitarily or not just gave the example to show that the existence of hamiltonian is not guaranteed whatever know of the function sr is that it belongs to hilbert space so the question is absolute square itegrability ensures as sufficient condition the existence of hamiltonian for the system an example expand sr in quantum superposition of the eigenfunctions sr with exp introducing this superposition in the schrodinger equation with the hamiltonian obtain that sr is not equal with hsr but could it be that another hamiltonian may exist the schrodinger eq be satisfied

150899 this was recently brought up and havent been able to conclude solid answer lets say we have two identical boxes and on earth both capable of holding vacuum and withstanding atm outside acting upon them is holding vacuum while is filled with air at atm shouldnt they weigh the same as measured by scale current thought process the following thought experiment suggests theyd have the same weight but havent formulaically shown this and everyone has disagreed so far take box like so its full of atm air and place it on scale heres cross section box scale now taking note of the scale readings start gradually pushing down the top side rectangle square of the box assume the air can somehow escape out of the box as we push down then etc until the top side is touching the bottom of the box so the box no longer has any air between the top and bottom sides it seems to me that pushing the top of the box down wouldnt change the weight measured by the scale the state above where the top touches the bottom is equivalent to having box like just box holding vacuum which is how arrived to my conclusions that they should weigh the same what am missing if anything whats simple ish way to model this
150994 when ray of light is projected say from the surface of earth to outside in space the condition is that there is no obstruction to it till infinity it travels only in vaccum my question is that how far can that ray of light go also instead of ray of light if consider beam of laser with same conditions then how far can beam of laser go compare both the situations and does the lightray of light and beam of laser stops after traveling some distance or it has no end
151121 can calculate the size of real object by just looking at the picture taken by camera think people do that dont understand how from physics point of view
151150 in my introductory chemistry class we are learning about the basics of quantum mechanics we were introduced to the concept of emission and absorption spectra our textbook describes how electrons can only exist at certain energy levels and the packets of energy absorbed and emitted as they transition between these levels give rise to absorption and emission spectra the book then goes on to describe black body as hypothetical object that can absorb and emit at all wavelengths understand that this is only hypothetical object but how does that even make sense if electrons can only exist at certain energy levels furthermore the book immediately goes on to describe things such as the stefan boltzmann law and wiens law and all kinds of graphs of how temperature and intensity and wavelength of black body relate to each other but if black body is theoretical how do we even know these relations am just completely confused about the entire concept of black body
151331 suppose ball is flying towards me at speed of 10m and that on impact feel amount of pain if instead it was me flying towards the ball at the same speed with all other conditions being the same would feel the same amount of pain
151332 when solving the schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom the coulomb potential frac pi epsilon is used the coulomb potential comes from classical electrodynamics so why do we use it when solving the non relativistic hydrogen atom is the coulomb potential also used to solve the hydrogen atom in relativistic quantum mechanics
151374 if force is applied to body which does not act through its centre of mass it rotates about its centre of mass and not any other point why
151640 my understanding is that at the present rate of expansion of the universe some galaxies are growing more distant from us at such rate that light from them will never reach us my question is how far away galaxy must be for this to be true of it
152731 this is what commonly read the cmb came to existence when atoms where formed and photons werent constantly absorbed anymore in other words the universe became transparent because of the expansion of the universe that radiation experienced red shift so that now its temperature is slightly below kelvin so far so good but what does it mean for the cmb to have temperature temperature usually means the jiggling about of atoms but the cmb is radiation so what is meant when it is said that the temperature of the cmb is about today
152808 have been working on quantum biology and found something interesting that would like to write an equation for scientists have wondered how plants have such high efficiency in photosynthesis they always thought that the photons energy needed for photosynthesis reach the reaction center by jumping from cell to cell but this doesnt predict the high efficiency then scientists realized that maybe the photons energy goes into superposition to try all the possible paths which would be the states and when the shortest path is found the photons wave functions collapse into the states correlating to the shortest path to the reaction center according to discover magazine within chlorophyll so called antenna pigments guide energy from light collecting molecules to nearby reaction center protein along choice of possibles pathways to explain the near perfect performance of plants biophysicists reasoned the energy must exist in quantum superposition state traveling along all the molecular pathways at the same time once the quickest road is found the idea goes the system snaps out of superposition and onto this route allowing all the energy to take the best path every time so how would write an equation for this was thinking about path integrals but couldnt find way to use it know that for quantum superposition psix s1 rangle s2 rangle s3 rangle ldots and the probability is int psix 2dx langle s1 s1 rangle langle s2 s2 rangle am not sure how to write wave function collapse equation can combine this knowledge into one equation or should still use path integrals extra information on the topic
152880 in quantum mechanics hermitian operators play very important role because they possess real eigenvalues considering frac dx it is hermitian operator actually its the simplest hamiltonian and its eigenfunction can be expressed by ikx however what if is imaginary if is imaginary frac dx ikx 2e ikx still holds with its eigenvalue imaginary can anyone tell me whats wrong here edit as one comment states the problem may lie in the restriction of unfortunately most physics textbooks just ignore the restriction of can anyone give me rigorous proof that plain wave ikx with real is somehow appropriate in most situations
152906 does someone know of clear pedagogical example where one can really seewith the math where interaction and measurement are not synonymous in quantum mechanics know that every measurement involves certain interaction with the outside world momentum gain from photon which results in the system collapsing into one of its eigenstates meaning pure state on the other hand it is also known that not all interactions result in collapsing into eigenstates of the system so they are in principle very different from what we call measurement it would be definitely nice to also see bit of the math behind maybe for simplicity just restricting it to operator algebra and showing how measurement and interaction are defined shedding clear light on their difference must admit from purely physical point of view dont know their difference either
152924 think that an adiabatic expansion of gas should cause the entropy to increase on the other hand we have for adiabatic processes that dq and therefore ds which is why thought that adiabatic processes are always isentropic but somehow this adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas does not fit into this scheme as it is quite obvious that this cannot be reversible process so how is this reconcilable with ds
152979 the gravitational binding energy of the earth is so the same amount of energy must have been released during the earths history according to this and this the current internal energy of the earth is and according to this source the amount of heat loss due to outward radiation by the earth during the entire lifetime of the planet is about so by adding those two numbers we get the earth internal energy energy radiated which is an order of magnitude less than what we should expect we are also ignoring the fact that of the current internal energy of the earth is due to radioactive decay so where did the rest of the energy go
153361 suppose wagon is moving at constant velocity on friction less surface and rain begins to fill the wagon the net force on the wagon is zero so momentum is conserved as the mass of the wagon increases the speed decreases but if the velocity of the wagon changes the net force cant be zero right there has to be some force opposing the motion of the wagon to slow it down how do we reconcile this
153385 in this article they call weight bar fields marginal why are these fields called marginal why are they to be distinguished
153478 having just finished physics ive been slightly exposed to showing that light is wave with speed sqrt mu epsilon using the differential forms of maxwells equations though this is the only derivation ive come across can you show the same thing using the integral forms my first thought is that it may be more difficult since the wave equation is often given as differential equation note have not taken vector calculus or even multivariable and do not have sufficient mathematical or even physical background to explicitly do the derivation im merely asking for hopefully understandable solution or source to the solution
153538 this morning saw an ant and suddenly question came to my mind how do ants actually carry items much heavier than themselves whats the difference in physics between us and them
153657 ligo laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory is large scale physics experiment aiming to directly detect gravitational waves the device measures the phase shift laser beams if understand this well the measurement assumes that suitable gravitational wave reduces and prolongs one of the tubes and the extension will take effect in the phase shifting laser beams but think if theres gravitational wave that passes through it it will affect everything even the laser beam this means that when the wave lengthens or shortens the tube it also lengthens or shortens the wavelength of the laser beam in my opinion therefore this device does not work or am wrong
153791 what is the exact use of the symbols partial delta and mathrm in derivatives in physics how are they different and when are they used it would be nice to get that settled once and for all frac partial partial frac delta delta frac mathrm mathrm for what know mathrm is used as small infinitisemal change and guess the straight up letter mathrm is usual notation instead of italic simply to tell the difference from variable of course we also have the big delta delta to describe finite non negligible difference and have some vague idea that partial is used for partial derivatives in case of three dimensional variables same goes for delta which would have sworn was the same as partial until reading this answer on math se https math stackexchange com then to make the confusion total noticed an equation like delta mathrm delta and read in physics text book that the fact that the amount of heat added between two states is dependent on the path is indicated by the symbol delta so it seems delta means something more the text book continues and says that function like the change in internal energy is called state function and its change is indicated by the symbol mathrm here am unsure of exactly why mathrm refers to state function so to sum it up down to the bone of it what is delta partial and mathrm exactly when we are talking derivatives in physics addition especially when reading mathematical process on physical equation like this procedure delta mathrm mathrm rightarrow delta int mathrm it appears that delta and mathrm are the same thing an integral operation handles it the same way apparently
153806 the most oft cited triumphs of gr are things such as the shifting perihelion of mercury gravitational redshift experiments and gravitational lensing but as far as know these are only verifications of einsteins equation in vacuum mu nu in fact think the former two are predicted in the schwarzchild metric the spherical solution to the vacuum equation but what do we have as far as compelling evidence that the einstein equation is valid in the presence of matter and energy mu nu frac mu nu pi mu nu are we simply happy with this because it is the simplest form of an equation in the presence of matter and energy where the left hand side has the same conservation law as the right side due to the bianchi identity or are there actual experimental observational verifications of solutions to this equation where mu nu is not trivial edit just want to be clear theres difference between in the presence of matter and energy and near the presence of matter and energy people keep on citing verifications of the vacuum field equation mu nu that happen to have nonzero curvature because of nearby matter the schwarzchild metric is an example of this the full einstein equation comes to play when mu nu ne and this describes the expression of the metric tensor at the same point in the manifold where is nonzero not just nearby point im asking if anybody knows of any tangible verification of solution to the einstein equation for nonzero energy momentum tensor so that excludes most of the examples people gave and if there is none how confident are we to assume the full equation just by symmetry arguments alone hope this makes things clearer
153807 know that hbar is pi and that is the planck constant rm but why dont we just use is it that hbar is used in angular momentum calculations
153904 as learned today in school my teacher told me that when light enters glass slab it slows down due to the change in density and it speeds up as it goes out of the glass slab this causes lateral shift and the light emerges out from the point different than that from where it should have actually emerged from okay so what mean to ask is when light enters point on glass slab and emerges from point why does the light speed up where does it get the energy it has lost when it entered the glass slab also if place very very very large glass slab and make beam of light pass through it will the light never come out as all the energy was lost in place of heat
153926 the earth moves through space at mph the milky way travels through local group at mph wouldnt you need fixed point to be able to measure velocity against after all compared to the total speed of our milky way the earth isnt moving through space what fixed points do we compare against when we say the speed of light is what is that relative to
153937 what is currently stopping us from having theory of everything what mathematical barriers or others are stopping us from unifying gr and qm have read that string theory is means to unify both so in this case is it lack of evidence stopping us but is the theory mathematically sound
153965 want to develop game where time runs backwards based on the idea that physical laws are reversible in time however when have objects at rest on the earth having gravity run backwards would mean that the objects are repulsed and falling upwards obviously that is not how things happen in the real world objects stay at rest for long time without having just fallen down so what is my logic mistake how can start planning simple physics engine with reverse time flow with gravity without that happening
153990 consider the usual hamiltonian describing the motion of particle hat frac hat 2m vr where for simplicity the problem can be considered in 1d on the semiaxis infty and vr real and positive we know that the solutions psi are orthogonal in the sense that int infty dr psi psi delta tag where delta can be kronecker or dirac depending on whether is discrete or continuous my question is there any proof that the other orthogonality holds proof for int infty infty dk psi psi delta tag here we have delta dirac and the integral is over repeat am asking about rigorous proof and for this hamiltonian not for simpler ones note that the solutions psir dont necessarily have bounded norm see equation
154088 was wondering why is everything in this universe mean atoms and well quarks and photons and what not some form of sphere is there any exploitation to the sphere being perfect and only thing for the job why not it is square or rectangle or maybe triangles mean we never saw photon or quark anyway right yet all my books shows that these particles are sphere
154105 was just wondering if there could be process that could unpolarize polarazied light is that possible
154227 touched tree that was touching an electric fence and got an electric shock how was this possible if wood is an insulator the tree wasnt wet either and it was pretty strong shock too
154307 asked this question in philosophy se but was advised to direct it here despite it is in my opinion somewhat too speculative for physics se high entropy generally means high disorder and low entropy low disorder the two paradigmatic cases that illustrate these two possibilities is gas for the first and crystal for the second since entropy always increases in general its expected that the entropy at the beginning of the universe should be the lowest possible which means it ought to be considered as crystal on the other hand as the universe is squeezed to something smaller than an atom one expects the temperature to climb precipitously and for any structure in matter and perhaps space and time too to melt and hence approach the state of gas perhaps plasma might be better description here how can one resolve these two possibilities does considering that the singularity is black hole allow one to make some guarded guesses here
154350 electrons belong to group of elementary particles called leptons there are charged and neutral leptons and electron is the charged one but how come it got charged the negative or positive charges were assigned by convention but it is fact that electrons are charged my question is why electrons and not neutrons also while reading http en wikipedia org wiki electron saw that independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons electrons in metals also behave as if they were free in reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi electrons quasiparticles which have the same electrical charge spin and magnetic moment as real electrons but may have different mass or effective mass extra mass that particle seems to have while interacting with some force what does this mean
154373 was always taught that frac dx ln frac no derivative had as result any dx words in physics book encountered something like this error discussion there might be little difference as dont have the book right now we have ln ln ln so after deriving both sides we get frac da frac db frac dc why is this small difference da db dc put in there why isnt it frac 1a frac 1b frac 1c and what are we differentiating in reference to or what another example this is exactly like this we have frac frac rho nrt lets treat as function of and differentiate both sides wrt then we have frac frac rho frac dv dt frac dv dt nr once again why are we adding this difference quotient frac dv dt is this as the derivative of the internal function
154403 in the expanding universe the velocity of separation between galaxies depends upon how far they are if they are much far away will they have relative velocity of separation greater than speed of light and if so how can we even detect such galaxies there are things like quantum information that can travel faster than light using entanglement is there any any possibility to detect such unseen horizons using such effects
154443 the general equation for the force of friction static or kinetic is mu where is the force of friction and mu is the coefficient of friction its value is dependent upon the surfaces interacting on each other why is it that this equation is so simple and does not contain any other variables that account for the force of friction on an object does anyone know how this equation was developed
154461 have had this question in my mind for long time thought you guys might enlighten me easily am confused about some space photographs and claims like this galaxy is billions light years away from us how we can take the photograph of something that far if it is billion light years away wouldnt it take billion light years to take those pictures today this post led me to ask this question at last space picture there certainly is something dont know about photography or light years if you could tell me the logic behind this would appreciate it am not physicist or any science guy so please tolerate my ignorance
154468 understand how one associates the spin of quantum particle of photon with intrinsic angular momentum and in electromagnetism have always understood the polarization of an em wave as the oscillations of the and field not necessarily being aligned with the direction of propagation of the wave questions but when one talks about the polarization of photon in quantum mechanics how does it really differ from its spin are they somehow related and whats the physical idea behind photon polarization in contrast to photon spin feel free to use mathematical reasonings as well if you see it fit
154580 reaction wheels mounted on spacecrafts and satellites are used for precision attitude control it is not clear to me how they can do this though my best guess is that when motor accelerates rotating mass it exerts torque on the flywheel and itself as in if motor exerts of torque on the flywheel in microgravity the system acts as though frac was applied in different directions to both flywheel and motor is this the correct way to think about how reaction wheels work if not would assume that they work by some complex interaction of the flywheels by making them precess
154651 context why is it so easy to create audible sounds in life with basically anything putting your cup of coffee on table comes with sound turning page of your book comes with sound even something as soft as towel creates sound when you move it or unfold it when leaves on the ground are moved by wind one hears the sound of course the list doesnt have an end but you get the point my own guess is that it must be related to the average density of air around us which as it so happens makes air compression caused by our day to day activities audible the fact that our hearing frequency range extends from hz to hz is most probably due to evolutionary reasons namely that those with poorer hearing range had harder time to survive but thats another story question all that aside what criteria need to be fulfilled for an acoustic sound to be audible fit into our hearing range would imagine that for complete picture of the problem there are many factors to consider density of the object rho creating the sound density of air rho rm air for simplicity lets assume it is constant fixed latitude speed of the moving object the objects cross section probably very crucial factor as it goes hand in hand with the intensity of the acoustic wave id imagine the objects surface details rough soft hard flat etc any back of the envelope estimation with the minimum necessary number of factors to take into account will do fine
154735 according to the standard model the electroweak symmetry is unbroken at high temperatures and therefore all gauge bosons are massless then but since fermions are said to acquire mass by different mechanism im wondering if they too become massless so are fermions massless at high temperatures
154753 initially thought in special relativity the velocity was constant whereas general relativity allowed treatment of accelerated frames as well but now have heard that sr is only valid locally
155015 this paradox is very common it seems in which sees bs clock running slow and sees as clock running slow here is the question little more concretely lets say flies by as spaceship if bs clock advances then in that time as clock advances gamma through time dilation this is easily shown if there is light clock next to now from as perspective assume there is light clock next to during that same time interval he sees bs clock run slower and thus this time interval must be gamma equating the time intervals gives gamma and gamma which is clearly wrong how is this reconciled
155169 on the topic of pauli matrices have noticed that some authors tend to use the term matrix and group interchangeably am asking because do not see see any profound difference referring to the matrix as group or vice versa for me it is like calling number an integer and an integer number in other words in what context do categorize certain matrix as belonging to group and what are some of the implication of doing so

155539 from the school physics know that the material objects bounce from the plane surface at the same angle losing some kinetic energy in the same school was taught that the light and waves in general obeys this principle too obviously in the case of light the plane surface should be perfect mirror but cant understand how should this work from the quantum point of view lets assume that our mirror consists of single silver atom why should the electrons of this atom re emit consumed photons at some specific angle
155727 the moment of inertia moi of rod that rotates around its center is frac while rod that rotates around its end is frac ml as listed here that doesnt sound right please see the image rod that rotates around its center can be viewed as two rods rotating around common end point each rods moi is frac ml so two rods have moi frac ml what is wrong

156251 current is scalar with units of mathrm it is defined as frac mathrm mathrm current density is vector vec with magnitude with units of mathrm it is current per unit cross sectional area and is defined as vec nq vec where is the number of moving charges with drift velocity why is defined to not have direction current density vec is defined as vector so why is current not there are many questions about current vs current density like this this and this but none answers my question about one being vector and the other being scalar is it simply just definition it just seems so obvious to define current as vector too another but equivalent definition of current density is int vec cdot vec mathematically the dot product gives scalar but for me this doesnt give much explanation still as we could just as well have mathematically defined current as vector and then used the area in scalar form in an equivalent formula like vec int vec cdot da is it just definition without further reason or is there point in keeping in scalar form
156280 can you give visual example of what is antimatter with the re opening of large haldron collider scheduled in mar im reading that they smash two particles together to try to re create particles that might have been there are the beginning of the big bang and this includes antimatter is antimatter something we can see or it is some invisible field im trying to get my arms around this concept
156286 what is so fundamentally different between rotation and translation that one can be represented with single vector and the other one needs an matrix
156308 if all we can observe are things inside the observable universe how do we know that anything even exists outside this boundary can see four ways of solving this problem we wait while the observable universe should get larger so we should be able to observe more dont think this is practical though since telescopes have only existed for hundred years or so whereas the age of the universe is many degrees larger also galaxies are expanding outwards so they will probably escape the observable universe horizon before we can observe them we go to another planet and the centre of the observable universe there is different so in effect we can see further then we could before this is also impractical we cant travel large enough distances for this effect to even have an inkling of an effect no way of knowing all the matter that is within the observable universe could be all that there is and we would have no way of knowing if anything even exists outside theoretical calculations well scientists seem to be able to calculate from redshifts the amount of dark matter dark energy and matter in the universe that would mean that we would gain an understanding of what should be outside our observable universe though we may never see it this seems the most logical but have no idea how these calculations are carried out any insight would be appreciated
156318 if traveled fast enough my current understanding is that visible light would be blueshifted to the blue uv range but also that microwaves and longer wavelength waves would be blueshifted into the visible range is this true if were to go fast enough would be able to see the cmb in reality doesnt the earth hurtle around the sun quite quickly so either this effect doesnt exist or youd need to go many orders of magnitude faster an estimation perhaps
156529 so saw this tip but dont think this is true it would be that your leg or shoe is more flexible than hard floor so the momentum change would be slower right
156606 this is perhaps total newbie question and will try to formulate it the best can so here it goes how does an electromagnetic wave travel through for example the vacuum of space usually see that waves are explained using analogies with water pieces of rope the strings of guitar etc but it seems to me that all those waves need medium to propagate in fact from my point of view in those examples the wave as thing does not exist its just the medium that moves involuntary reference to the matrix sorry but in space there is no medium so how does wave travel are there free particles of some sort in this vacuum or something believe the existence of ether was discarded by michelson and morley so supposedly there isnt medium for the wave to travel through moreover ive seen other answers that describe light as perturbation of the electromagnetic field but isnt the existence of the field potential until disturbed how can it travel through something it does not exist until its disturbed by the traveling light in the first place this last sentence is probably big misconception by me
156715 im studying for test in quantum mechanics and im currently trying to learn about perturbation theory and ive realized that dont quite understand what im doing when im doing my calculations considering the case of non degenerate perturbation theory the formula for the first order energy correction is langle psi psi rangle what exactly does this mean understand that its some kind of expectation value of the perturbation but what more and what is the meaning of
156740 am taking course in classical mechanics these days which evolves the two body problem need some clarity about the following questions if possible consider two stars orbiting around each other one with mass the other with mass is this the case depicted here where bodies with difference in mass orbiting around common barycenter where is the of the system could this problem be treated so that one body is standing still and the other is orbiting it in an elliptical orbit if so where is the focus of this ellipse
156861 was reading this link just above the paragraph titled other conservation laws it says that this conversion of mass to energy happens well below the speed of light in very small way when stick of dynamite explodes portion of that stick becomes energy and the fact that this portion is equal to just parts out of billion indicates the vast proportions of energy available from converted mass think this is incorrect the chemical energy in the dynamite is converted to heat light and sound there is no nuclear reaction taking place to convert mass into energy am wrong
156879 whats the symbol called thats behind and to the right of einsteins head in this picture bonus if you can tell me what the whole formula is
156884 right now all of the stuff that has been created in the world is made of protons electrons and neutrons im aware that particles other than these have much shorter lifetimes but ive also heard that mixing particles in the same state can increase their lifetimes the neutron for example has half life of minutes when its alone but is stable in an atom could we make combinations of other particles that last for at least days at time the combination need not consist entirely of new particles it must just have at least one am very interested in this subject so ideally id like concrete answer not just guess
156890 how the blueshift from andromeda galaxy was measured since the measurement of blueshift redshift has to do with the identification of relative distance of spectral lines how this identification is possible under the influence of such big number of stars with very different characteristics
156907 hilbert space and rays in very general sense we say that quantum states of quantum mechanical system correspond to rays in the hilbert space mathcal such that for any the state psi and psi map to the same ray and hence are taken as equivalent states how should one interpret the above in order to understand why psi and psi are the same states clearly for it doesnt hold and for it is trivial but why should this equivalence hold for any other knowing hilbert space is complex vector space with inner product is ray just another way of saying vectors in the case that just corresponds to phase factor of type phi with phi in mathbb then obviously psi phi psi the norms didnt change then what is the influence of phi at all in other words what does the added phase of phi to the default phase of psi change in terms of the state of the system projective hilbert space furthermore through process of projectivization of the hilbert space mathcal it is possible to obtain finite dimensional projective hilbert space mathcal in the projective hilbert space every point corresponds to distinct state and one cannot talk in terms of rays anymore what does such projectivization entail in conceptual sense guess in other words how are rays projected to single points in the process and what implies the distinctness is such process in any way analogous to the gram schmidt process used to orthonormalise set of vectors in linear algebra when one limits the hilbert space to that of certain observable of the system at hand momentum or spin space in order to measure the momentum and spin of system respectively does that mean were talking about projective spaces already is the spin space spanned by up left uparrow rangle right and down left downarrow rangle right spins states of system referred to as projective spin hilbert space the aim is to develop better and clearer understanding of such fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics

156943 in my physics book after this solved example child of mass is initially at rest on top of water slide at height 5m above the bottom of the slide assuming that the slide is frictionless because of water find the speed of the child at bottom of slide comment was written if we were asked to find the time taken for the child to reach the bottom of the slide methods would be of no use we would need to know the shape of the slide and we would have difficult problem why does the author say that we would need to know the shape of the slide to find the time taken for the child to reach bottom of the slide cant we use newtons first law of motion in uniform acceleration to find the time we can find velocity at bottom sqrt 2gh 13m approx using first law at 8t
156984 in this question about absorption of continuous energies by discrete atom states one of the reasons given to explain the width of spectral lines is the uncertainty principle natural broadening the decay of an electron from an excited state emits photon with an uncertain energy until observed within certain range in order to respect energy conservation does that mean that the energy levels of ground and or excited states in an atom also have uncertainty and thus continuous range of possible energies for each level instead of unique energy value as the electron can decay between two excited states not necessarily to the ground state would expect that to be at least true for excited states however this page gives energy values for the ground and first excited states of hydrogen electron without any range im not sure if that means that theres no range and thus no uncertainty or if theres simply no need to indicate it not useful can be calculated from the theory wikipedia states that both ground and excited states are quantum states but dont know if that necessarily implies that all associated properties are subjected to uncertainty
157003 the question why does the air pressure at the surface of the earth exactly equal the weight of the entire air column above it asks why the air pressure at any elevation is equal to the weight of the column of air above it in the atmosphere im not convinced by any of the answers also im going to slightly change the topic from tall column of air in the atmosphere to the much simpler problem of tall column of gas in laboratory the many processes that take place in the earths atmosphere muddy the waters too much all of the answers boil down to considering small parcel of gas gravity pushes that parcel downwards the gas pressure differential pushes the parcel upwards static equilibrium requires that the two forces be equal and this results in the desired conclusion indeed feynmann chapter makes this same argument in his lectures so suppose it must be correct many physics textbooks make essentially the same argument for equilibrium water pressure as well my problem is that gas does not exist in small packets surrounded by thin weightless membranes as those explanations all seem to imply gas molecules flow freely throughout space dont understand what it means for packet of gas to be in equilibrium when molecules are entering and leaving the packet all of the time presumably the same number of molecules enter it as leave it but the conditions for that to occur seem like they must be substantially more complex than the above explanations imply especially when collisions are taken into account is this another case where because the mean free path of gas molecules is so small they drift very slowly and hence behave as if they were really in small fixed packets if so would the above claims not apply in less dense atmosphere high vacuum here are two explanations that seem plausible to me is either of them correct note that again im neglecting large scale atmospheric effects such as solar radiation so that the answers will be relevant to column of gas in laboratory both explanations disregard collisions however collision between two molecules obviously occurs only if the two molecules are at the same height since collisions are elastic and thus conserve total kinetic energy the average kinetic energy of all molecules at any height is thus not affected by collisions since both proposals below are based largely on the concept of gravitational potential energy changing into kinetic energy as molecules fall they should thus not be affected by collisions here are the two theories gravity makes molecules gradually accelerate downwards neglecting collisions the molecules closer to the earth would thus be on average moving faster they are still moving in random directions but are moving faster than the molecules higher up due to their lower gravitational potential energy similarly because molecules tend to fall there are more molecules lower down than higher up thus lower heights will have higher concentration of molecules moving at higher speeds this will result in diffusion gradient of molecules moving upwards this diffusion gradient will eventually balance the gravitational pull downwards resulting in equilibrium result close to the bottom we will have more molecules and they will be moving faster resulting in more kinetic energy per unit volume which means more pressure but while the argument seems to make sense qualitatively thats long way from quantitative proof heres completely different and quantitative argument consider dropping single molecule from some height it will accelerate downwards until it bounces elastically into the earth and then slow down as it rises up to the original height and then do it over and over again bit of simple newtonian mechanics quickly predicts the kinetic energy as function of height and then the velocity as function of height and then the amount of time spent in any small height interval and then the fraction of the total time that the molecule spends in any small height interval now do this with many molecules that never collide the number density at any height is then proportional to the fraction of time molecule spends at that height and the pressure at any height must be the number density times the kinetic energy per molecule in fact few simple calculations that would be happy to include if requested quickly result in precisely the conclusion that we wanted that the pressure change in any parcel is exactly equal to the weight of that parcel it also predicts that temperature increases closer to the ground due to the gravity induced higher kinetic energy per molecule wonderful but is it correct note that since molecules move more slowly at higher altitude it also predicts that the number density increases at high altitude which seems wrong like theory because its quantitative and it exactly predicts that pressure at any height will equal the weight of the gas above it its prediction that number density increases at higher altitudes seems hard to stomach but seems unavoidable if molecules move more slowly at high altitudes which they almost certainly do then they spend more time traversing the same height delta at high altitudes than low and they thus are statistically more likely to be found at high altitudes
158070 am rather perplexed with this fact that though helium nucleus is boson the particles insides it protons and neutrons are essentially fermions how the nucleus which is made by fermions can be boson does spin has role in it
158246 im physics and electronics and astronomy etc enthusiast as learn and research topics notice that many si units are often expressed using variety of prefixes such as in electronics where we use microvolts millivolts volts kilovolts and sometimes megavolts in computer storage the prefixes kilo mega giga and tera are very familiar in physics however for large quantities of mass usually just see kilograms used with scientific notation times10 kg this could also be expressed as gigagrams but ive never heard anyone use that particular unit which might be why it sounds silly understand that it is impractical to use prefix for something as large as the mass of the sun times10 kg but wouldnt it be more appropriate to use grams as in times10 is this simply out of convention or is there more logical reason
158319 number of times have encountered in text books and articles that neutrinos might contribute only small fraction to dark matter the reason has to do with the fact that if all of the dark matter consisted of neutrinos then small scale structures in the universe could not have formed yet because as they say neutrinos wash out small fluctuations however none of these texts provided reference to any specific sources explaining in detail what is meant by washing out after all neutrinos are notorious in their weak interaction with baryonic matter so if there is small scale fluctuation of baryons then how background neutrinos can prevent it from growing further if they practically do not interact with baryons guess the question boils down to calculating cross sections of interactions at specific temperatures would appreciate comments and references to sources addressing this particular issue
158421 in feynmans lectures on physics volume chapter he states that einsteins field equation is equivalent to the statement that in any local inertial coordinate system the scalar curvature of space which he gives in terms of the radius excess of small sphere is proportional to the energy density at that point does anyone know of an elegant proof of this fact have half elegant proof based on the following show that the tt component of the stress energy tensor is equal to energy density in inertial coordinates straightforward show that the tt component of the einstein curvature tensor is proportional to the scalar curvature of space in inertial coordinates horrific argue that since and are both symmetric tensors and symmetric tensors form an irreducible representation of the lorentz group if the tt components are equal in every local inertial frame then the tensors themselves must be equal straightforward the problem with the above is that the only way can find to prove step is to explicitly calculate the radius excess in terms of the metric in local inertial coordinates this requires finding the geodesic paths of length to order expanding the metric to third order at the surface of the generated sphere and calculating the surfacearea or volume found area easier the integral for the surface area ends up with about terms to take care of which do not seem to be easily reducible through symmetry considerations and took me several pages to do since the relationship between scalar curvature and the curvature tensors is quite fundamental expect there must be more direct abstract argument but cannot find it

158532 want to know why snowflakes and other crystals grow symmetrically and find the leading answer to the established question to be entirely unsatisfactory when water freezes you get ice ice like many solid materials forms crystalline structure in the case of water the crystalline structure may be attributed to the hydrogen bond special kind of an attractive interaction so big chunk of ice will have crystalline structure preferred directions translational symmetry and some rotational symmetries nature adds one water molecule at time the molecules always try to choose the most energetically favored position on the frozen body because these laws of creation of snowflake are symmetric with respect to the rotational symmetries it follows that any symmetry that exists at the beginning hexagonal symmetry of small number of molecules in the initial crystal will be preserved no sorry it doesnt follow at all something hugely important is missing from this answer causality suppose the snowflake at one moment is perfectly symmetrical then suppose random molecule gets added at point to maintain the symmetry later on random molecule gets added at corresponding point and four others but the motion of the water molecule is random and there is no reason for it to end up at or anywhere else in particular even considering theos remarks about dendrite growth why dont we see this see absolutely no reason why any given additional water molecule cannot land in an energetically unfavourable position besides if low energy considerations were driving force snowflakes would be approximately spherical so whats really going on how can bump at create an attractive force at distant
158757 ive read the shell theorem during gravitation lectures know it states that the net gravitational field inside 3d spherical shell or uniform 2d ring is zero now assume thin spherical shell if put particle inside the shell so that it was infinitesimally close to one of the regions of the shell shouldnt the particle move towards the shell and touch the portion of the shell it was closest to since as the distance goes to zero the magnitude of the field between the particle and that portion of the shell should be very high when compared to the field from other regions but in the same case if apply the shell theorem the particle shouldnt move at all since it states the net gravitational field inside the shell is zero can anybody explain this difference or if there isnt any how am wrong

158824 look at the hubble ultra deep field photo the stars in it are on the order of arcsecond across to an order of magnitude this is radians in text telescope which was held steady for seconds in other words the velocity of the aperture of the telescope around the light sensors had to be on the order of one angstrom per second perhaps my maths is wrong but this seems like an extraordinary feat of control cant quite believe it the computer programmer in me suspects that since the image was captured across number of occasions each occasion would be smeared somewhat less than single long exposure and some kind of correspondence finding algorithm could alight the images and infer the drift of the telescope in any case even if that is what they did the satellite is held amazingly steady how do we achieve this

158946 when visited wikipedias page on minkowski space it seemed to offer two definitions the first defined minkowski space vector space then in later section it says the section above defines minkowski space as vector space there is an alternative definition of minkowski space as an affine space which views minkowski space as homogenous space of the poincar group with the lorentz group as the stabilizer see erlangen program are both definitions equally valid do physicists usually prefer to work with one interpretation versus another do they offer different benefits
159021 ive been wondering what makes the harmonic oscillator such an important model what came up with it is relatively simple system making it perfect example for physics students to learn principles of classical and quantum mechanics the harmonic oscillator potential can be used as model to approximate many physical phenomena quite well the first point is sort of meaningless though think the real reason is my second point im looking for some materials to read about the different applications of the ho in different areas of physics

159273 in the case of classical field theory noethers theorem ensures that for given action int mathrm dx mathcal phi mu partial nu phi mux that stays invariant under the transformation rightarrow delta phi mu rightarrow phi mu delta phi mu namely local symmetry then there exist conserved quantities named currents if it exist set of variables epsilon rx phi mu where epsilon rightarrow such that delta epsilon and delta phi mu epsilon phi mu then these currents are the quantities nu frac partial mathcal partial partial nu phi mu phi mu left mathcal delta sigma nu frac partial mathcal partial partial nu phi mu partial sigma phi mu right sigma these are conserved in the sens that partial nu nu which is true on shell provided equations of motion are verified now im trying to apply this result in the case of classical em field theory considere the associated lagrangian mathcal em frac mu nu mu nu mu mu where mu phi textbf is the potential and mu rho textbf is the current describing classical charge sources mu nu is the em tensor in that case equations of motion are partial nu nu mu mu considering the global gauge symmetry of the classical em field theory mu rightarrow mu epsilon partial mu chi where chi is an arbitrary gauge function id like to apply the noethers theorem in the case where refering to this post then the associated conserved current reads mu mu nu partial nu chi quad text with quad partial mu mu fine now have few questions is it actually really legit to apply noethers theorem to global gauge symmetry mean is noethers theorem still hold even if have set epsilon rx phi mu no transformation on coordinates related physics stackexchange com questions gauge symmetry is not symmetry in that case what does the mu quantity physically means one can compute using equations of motion and the anti symmetry of mu nu partial mu mu partial mu mu nu partial nu chi mu nu partial mu partial nu chi nu partial nu chi would rather expect something like partial mu mu partial mu mu forall chi in that case could understand that charge conservation stems directly from global gauge symmetry there is something im clearly missing or should trick by computing int mathrm partial mu mu and perform an integration by part cant see anywhere clearly appearing the fact that the physics of classical em theory is invariant under lorentz transformation would expect that such invariance would be really strong symmetry of the system
159374 when finding the period of pendulum beyond the small angle approximation we have to use integration for small interval of theta and elliptical integration was trying to apply this situation for the driven pendulum when using small angle approximation the equation of motion would be like below ddot dot xt xt cos omega moment of inertia damping coefficient mass gravity acceleration distance between cm of the system and the origin of rotation amplitude of external force omega angular frequency of external force angular displacement time when not using small angle approximation above equation would be changed ddot xt dot xt sinxt cos omega cosxt then how do solve this differential equation tried to simulate the result with mathematicas dsolve but it didnt show the solution although plotted the graph with ndsolve want to know the way to solve that differential equation
159436 how do you calculate with how much force mass would hit the ground when falling from certain height in particular im curious to know how the force of impact on earth compares with mars so surface gravity needs to be accounted for according to wikipedia mars has surface gravity of or 33895g and earth has surface gravity of or 1g so assuming meter fall how hard would 100kg hit the ground
159590 space is very low temperature environment however it also has an extremely small number of particles per unit volume this leads me to believe that contrary to popular portrayals of heat loss in space there would be very little heat loss due to conduction on hypothetical spaceship in deep space if you were put into space and provided with food water heat and protected from the pressure would the spaceship cool due to head radiating away from the ship

159922 is there any lower or upper limit on the energy of photon does the mathematical framework we currently use to study photons blow up when photon surpasses certain upper limit of energy or the same on the opposite side my thoughts if let the energy of photon tend to infinity its wavelength would be tending to zero and since it is thought that we cannot really distinguish things when they are on the scale of planck length would the photon have its maximum energy when its wavelength is equal to the planck length feel free to correct me feel might not be and for the opposite end of the spectrum photon with the least energy would have zero wavelength implying no photon which is trivial case

160042 in diagrams often see light waves depicted as little sine waves that travel through space and often when describing polarizers the explainer will angle their hand to show the angle of polarization and bob it up and down in sine wave action apparently emulating the amplitude of the wave my questions is is the amplitude of light really like this where it moves up and down or side to side in space or is the sine wave relationship just an analogy
160347 by principle of equivalence an accelerated system and in general non inertial system of reference is equivalent to certain gravitational field if there is gravitational field spacetime is then curved meaning by no means can the metric ij be transformed to the minkowski metric eta ij however it occurs to me that the spacetime metric of the non inertial frame can be transformed to eta ij then in this sense why are these two systems equivalent

160548 how does adding one more particle to the nucleus of an atom give that atom new properties can see how it changes its mass thats obvious but how does it give that new atom different properties like color good example would be start with copper atom cu with the atomic number thus cu has protons and you add one proton to the nucleus you are left with an atom of zinc zn with the atomic number thus protons the first element mentioned is totally different color than the second and conducts electricity better etc not only protons but neutrons which are the same type of particle baryon affect the properties of the element in much different and much less important manner adding neutron only creates an isotope of that element not different one all together unlike adding proton also it is obvious that adding or subtracting electrons does not make difference for example if you remove electrons know that would take huge amounts of energy but lets ignore that that orbit the copper atom we are still left with copper atom although ion but still copper atom so its apparent that only protons play major role in making elements different from each other how and why also the same can be asked about the protons themselves and quark flavor
160718 few days ago the battery of my car went almost dead as it is manual car my father once told me that the way to get it going without jumper cables was to push it or let it roll down hill sink the clutch shift to 2nd gear and then let go the clutch after the joy of being able to revive the car got to wonder of the reason for why this works all could think of was electromagnetic induction however couldnt find anything on the web to support this im sure that there might be all sorts of engineering details so im only looking for the physical principles involved and the basic process that make this work
160759 einsteins two postulates of special relativity are as follows the principle of relativity the laws of physics are the same in all inertial systems there is no way to detect absolute motion and no preferred inertial system exists the constancy of the speed of light observers in all inertial systems mea sure the same value for the speed of light in vacuum now for an exercise in my book am requested the following explain why einstein argued that the constancy of the speed of light postulate actually follows from the principle of relativity postulate have been trying to figure this out for very long time now with no luck thought of identifying physical law that if not the same in two different inertial systems leads to contradiction but cant think of anything could you push me in the right direction
160937 consider conducting rod of length moving with speed in magnetic field of intensity let all the three parameters be perpendicular to each other moving charges in magnetic field experience force which will be in the downward direction in this case this will cause the electrons to accumulate towards lower end of the rod thus causing difference in potential we know that the emf induced in the rod will be blv or vec vec vec mathrm vec to be more precise thus current is induced in the rod current carrying conductor placed in magnetic field experiences force whose magnitude is given by ilb in the direction opposite to that of the velocity of the rod now consider an observer moving with the same velocity as that of the rod for him the charges are stationary yet the rod experiences force now as far as know the only thing that can cause force on stationary charges is an electric field so for him there must exist an electric field in the direction same as that of velocity of rod which is causing the electrons to experience force in the opposite direction electrons are negatively charged so force will be in the opposite direction to that of electric feld so does moving magnetic field produce an electric field

161126 my understanding of the stern gerlach experiment is that neutral total charge particles are sent through non homogeneous magnetic field with the expectation that the field will push that particles path higher or lower on detector because of the collective spin of that particle while the detector can detect particles in two dimensional surface the results of the experiment are that particles appear in only two localized areas directly above the path of the particle stream or directly below the path of the particle stream spin up or spin down the conclusions from these measurements are that the particle when measured will always have about the same magnitude why does this not follow from classical mechanical theory related to magnetism if you shot magnet through similar apparatus would expect the magnet to be rotated to align with the magnetic field in some way which at high enough field strengths relative to the mass of the magnet would cause us to measure basically the same magnitude as if the magnet entered the apparatus pre aligned with the field how is my explanation incorrect
161163 the copehagen interpretation of qm explains the stern gerlach experiment by asserting that particle is in superposition of states and doesnt have definite spin until measured however the de broglie bohm interpretation suggests that there is always definite position of the particle with well defined initial state which may not be measurable with enough precision including its spin this initial state defines the path the particle will take through the apparatus how does one explain the results that the spin of particle is always measured with its full magnitude along the plane of measurement would guess it has something to do with the pilot waves effects on the particle as its angular momentum is changed by the magnetic field
161176 know how to calculate the electrostatic energy of sphere it has well defined radius but how can calculate the electrostatic energy of an electron as it is point particle by electrostatic energy of charge distribution we generally mean the energy needed to place the charges where they are in short energy needed to create the system so how much energy need to create an electron

161453 understand that time is relative for all but as understand it time flows at slower rate for objects that are either moving faster or objects that are near larger masses than for those that are slower or further from mass so the illustrative example always see is that if were to leave earth and fly around at near light speed for while or go into orbit around black hole the time experience would be substantially shorter than for those left behind at home on earth and id come back to find that ive only aged however long felt was gone by my own clock but that on earth substantially more time would have elapsed following through on this model the stars in orbit around the black hole at the center of the milky way are aging much much slower relative to us right so does it not follow that the center of the galaxy is some appreciable have no idea how to go about putting this in an equation so will avoid guessing at the difference amount younger than the stuff further away from the center if this is not true could someone please explain why not and if it is true can someone please point me to where can calculate the age of the center of the galaxy and to be clear what im asking is if there was an atomic clock that appeared at the center of the galaxy when the center was first formed and we brought it through worm hole to earth today how much time would have elapsed on that clock vs the age we recon the galaxy currently is billion years

163225 am looking for summary of practical methods of focusing and collimating laser light which guess are contradictory objectives or are they for example when use typical small diode lasers even with the as shipped collimating lens find the beam tends to be around 1mm to 2mm in diameter and often very irregular or speckly would much rather have beam that is uniform and more like mm but do not know how to achieve that obviously it is possible to tightly focus laser because dvd players make tiny spot microns in size but this assume is only at one particular focal length not along the length of beam for my application machining metrology need to have beam that does not need to be focused yet is as narrow as possible note that this type of application operates on table top scale all of the illuminated areas will be between inch and feet or so what are the best practical methods of shaping laser beam according to this need
163378 in thinking how to ask this question somewhat succinctly keep coming back to microwave oven microwave oven has grid of holes over the window specifically designed to be smaller in diameter than the wavelength of the microwaves it produces yet larger than the wavelengths of the visible light spectrum this is so you can watch your food being heated without getting an eye full of microwaves the realness of electromagnetic waves seems indisputable both from the microwave example above and also because if want to broadcast radio wave with certain wavelength then need to make sure have an antenna of corresponding length to produce the wave im looking for furthermore we discuss and treat these waves as real measurable objects that exist and can be manipulated now if want to describe the behavior of my microwave oven in the framework of qm lets pretend my oven is going to only produce photon of energy corresponding to wavelength of the microwave spectrum for simplicity then ill describe the behavior of that photon as wavefunction that evolves over time and gives probability distribution within my microwave that similarly does not allow the photon to pass through the safety grid and exit the oven cavity giving me retinal burn the difference is the wavefunction is never treated as something real in this description when the safety grid is described as working to protect you because it has holes smaller than the wavelength of the classical waves its blocking this is useful description that seems to describe real objects be ables while it is possible to describe why an individual photon has low probability of passing through the same grid but extended physical properties such as wavelength in space are treated as non real because were dealing with point particle and with behavior described by something we also treat as non real the wavefunction it seems unclear to me why we insist this wave function which predicts behavior of physical measurements so well is somehow non real put another way if we have no problem treating em waves as real then why do we insist on treating the wavefunction that describes the same behavior as unreal understand there is recent research eric cavalcanti and his group for one trying to argue this point but as every respectable physics professor ive ever encountered has treated the wavefunction as an indisputably non real mathematical tool needed to ask this community for an answer
163439 consider the following equation begin equation nabla frac frac partial partial lefta partial partial partial frac partial right lefta partial partial partial frac partial right end equation am confused why dirac thought matrices were needed in place of abcd understand why in order to get all the cross terms such as partial partial to vanish we must assume ab ba ldots and why ldots but wikipedia then says dirac who had just then been intensely involved with working out the foundations of heisenbergs matrix mechanics immediately understood that these conditions could be met if and are matrices with the implication that the wave function has multiple components can someone explain why the above equations and the conditions suggest matrices should be used suppose one sees that the result must involve objects that do not commute under multiplication in order to satisfy the anticommutation property so that might be clue but arent there other non commutative things it could have been
163546 am trying to express superoperator the liouvillian as matrices and am having hard time finding way to do this for instance given the pauli matrix sigma how do find the matrix elements of the commutator superoperator so far have been trying to figure this out by trial and error making sure the superoperator acting on the operator vector still gives sigma rho in the end want to find superoperators in larger bases so am looking for systematic method to find the matrix elements
163604 according to this question and this web site photons undergo twice the deflection from gravitational fields as do physical objects however the weak equivalence principle states that locally everything falls at the same rate lets consider the following thought experiment we place two parallel perfect mirrors in uniform gravitational field between these mirrors we place bagel so light can travel through the hole we zap laser through the hole just as we drop the bagel the light and bagel are falling together in the bagels reference frame it seems that we should see the light travel perpendicularly back and forth through the hole so the light would stay within the hole ignoring divergence of the beam until the bagel hits the bottom its not completely local but pretty close but perfect mirror should only fold the trajectory of the photon so an external observer should see the light deflected at twice the rate of the bagel thus the external observer should see the laser drift lower inside the hole and eventually hit the bagel these two predicted observations clearly cannot be reconciled what actually happens for instance does the bagel frame no longer think the mirrors are perpendicular and the non perpendicularity works out such that the answer does not depend on the distance between mirrors
163691 never learnt qft and apologize for my probably elementary question somebody told me that in qft particle is viewed as an irregularity in the field on the other hand in an article in wikipedia see the sentence qft treats particles as excited states of an underlying physical field so these are called field quanta which one of the true is better description the 1st description hints that the particle is localized phenomenon inside field that maybe occupies big region in space the 2nd description speaks of an underlying field so is there field and in addition there is particle if it is then what is the occupation number of that underlying field none of these approaches is clear to me know the approach in qm and none of them resembles the qm the motivation behind my question is certain similarity that find between the above descriptions and the bohm interpretation of qm the background field in bohms interpretation there is background quantum potential and particle floating in it in all is particle treated in qft as localized phenomenon inside field occupying wider volume would appreciate simple and direct answer
163780 normal holograms are if understand correctly what happens when coherent light is passed through something that manipulates the photons wave functions to be what would have been present had they been reflected off real 3d object is it possible in principle to do that with something other than light in particular im thinking of electrons when ask this are electron holograms possible im imagining an electron microscope and some sort of nanoscale filter instead of laser and photographic film but this is just speculative

164455 the atmosphere is fluid and we have volume therefore we displace some of it and some buoyancy force must exist how strong is it how much does it affect gravitational acceleration on the surface of earth and considering only buoyancy no drag how much difference would make falling in atmosphere and vacuum
164490 the sky on the earth is blue could the color of the sky on planet with an atmosphere be of any color theoretically which colors are the most likely think it would be really awesome to have planet with green sky or red sky what conditions would have to be in place for this to happen by the way suspect its impossible for the sky to be white black grey or brown but maybe this is possible if not at all times during the day part of the day does the answer depend on whether the planet is gas planet or rocky one initially had in mind rocky planet but suspect gas planet allows you to cheat little because gases can be variety of colors red even
164511 news story is going viral on social media networks claiming that two physicists have found way to eliminate the big bang singularity or in laymans terms as claimed by many sensationalist news articles the big bang never happened at all the paper was published in phys lett and it seems to me that the basic idea of the paper is that it takes the raychaudhuri equation and replaces the geodesics with bohmian trajectories from bohms quantum analogue of the hamilton jacobi equation do not hold any expertise in this area but from whatever little have understood and as explained by friend of mine who may very well be wrong if we do few substitutions on this quantum raychaudhuri equation we would get the friedmann equations with few extra terms one of which looks like cosmological constant and another of which eliminates the big bang singularity now my question is how legitimate are the claims of the authors of this paper and if it holds any merit does it really eliminate the big bang singularity

165197 was once asked the following question by student was tutoring and was stumped by it when one throws stone why does it take the same amount of time for stone to rise to its peak and then down to the ground one could say that this is an experimental observation after one could envisage hypothetically where this is not the case one could say that the curve that the stone describes is parabola and the two halves are symmetric around the perpendicular line through its apex but surely the description of the motion of projectile as parabola was the outcome of observation and even if it moves along parabola it may putting observation aside move along it with its descent speed different from its ascent or varying and this in part leads to the observation or is justified by the newtons description of time it flows equably everywhere its because of the nature of the force its independent of the motion of the stone prefer the last explanation but is it true and is this the best explanation

165476 recently debate started whether it is good idea to send more messages into space in the hope of having alien civilizations receive them there are some predecessors most notably the arecibo message to globular cluster m13 which is an attempt to bridge thousand ly with 1mw of power at 2380mhz and 10hz frequency modulation total message duration minutes im interested in what type of antenna would be needed to detect such signal in distance of thousand ly dish diameter there are probably lot of factors involved so please state them if you provide calculation there are also people stating that we already broadcast on continuous basis since the time we invented radio communications and especially tv broadcasting because that kind of signal is much less directed and of lower power what would be the distance after which our tv signals would vanish in the cosmic noise and become undetectable
165526 if gravity is zero at the center of the earth why is there core of heavy elements such as iron alternate question for the opposite hypothesis if gravity is greatest at the center of the earth as classical education tells us why is the core not dominated by the heaviest elements elements heavier than iron am person reasonably familiar with technical terms but am not physicist so will appreciate answers that dont rely on equations am years old and want to explain it to my mother who is equally curious
166073 for my dissertation am preparing list of symbols used in the text which basically is table that consists of the symbol short explanation and the dimension it has as indicated below symbol description unit way travelled by the thing km fraction of the and the total possible way my problem lies in the second symbol which is dimensionless quantity could of course just leave the unit column empty for such quantities however that would look bit like there was something forgotten and therefore would like to indicate somehow that this symbol denotes dimensionless quantity is there convention to indicate that unit is dimensionless
166095 am trying to understand whether or not tachyons travel faster than light the linked wikipedia page shows some seemingly contradictory statements and they are confusing for instance the first sentence states that tachyons always travel faster than the speed of light whereas in later section it is claimed that they are actually propagating subluminally is it true that tachyons represent faster than light particles or not
166367 given the inverse square law force of gravity shouldnt two particles that are infinitely close to each other be infinitely attracted to one another for example suppose the hands of some super deity grabbed hold of two neutrinos and put them infinitely close to one another or suppose that some physicists in high energy particle physics laboratory shot two neutrinos together at super high speeds why should any forces be able to pull the neutrinos apart again after they collide why dont we find any tiny super dense lumps of matter around us that are the results of high energy collisions and that we are unable to pull apart
166568 according to textbook have begun to read there are seven base si units length mass time temperature amount of substance electric current luminous intensity what do not understand is why have these been chosen as the fundamental units it seems to me that mass amount current and luminous intensity could all be expressed with energy instead energy is for some reason derived unit why is this
166798 often read that until hawking the black holes were introducing problem with information allegedly information should be unable disappear while this was happening in classic black holes what about death when information contained in brain or device just irreversible dissipate in the environment and become lost is this treated as information disappear there are thermodynamics law stating that energy tends to dissipate irreversible is the same law exists for information if yes then what is the difference between irreversibility of information loss and disappearance of information in pre hawking black hole
166966 say you start off floating in space in fixed position and orientation with zero linear and angular velocity with no external forces so you are closed mechanical system by twisting your body around you cant change your linear momentum you cant change your position center of mass you cant change your angular momentum you can change your orientation rotation the fact that you can change your orientation comes as surprise to me why isnt it conserved like the other three quantities its familiar fact cats do it all the time in order to land on their feet and you can find videos of astronauts doing it on the international space station see the videos linked from https space stackexchange com questions how do astronauts turn in space but it still seems counterintuitive to me that they can do this while not being able to change the other three quantities is there some intuitively clear explanation as to why

167098 let there be hollow container made of glass or some other transparent material roughly the size and shape of an apple let the walls be of sufficient thickness for the container to be safely evacuated to some reasonable degree perhaps around mbar and then hermetically and evenly sealed how could one prove that the container is evacuated and with what accuracy would ray crystallography laser scattering light absorption or emission or ultrasound be possible ways is there simple way of demonstrating that the container is evacuated perhaps by placing something inside it before sealing which behaves in very specific and obvious way in vacuum without actually removing said vacuum aside from the obvious feather which would fall without air resistance was thinking of something along the lines of small quantity of cesium but that wouldnt be distinguishable from an inert gas atmosphere thanks edit there is no reference container to compare with and the container itself isnt standardized so density weight considerations are out if am right actually so is light refraction probably as the container walls arent really level enough considering the small refraction delta mentioned in andrew reply
167114 have natural gas fireplace with fake logs in it open the flue turn on the gas for couple seconds and throw match in the flames kind of go up and out of the flue but most of the flames go out of the fireplace towards the front almost burning the wall then when open my backdoor something equalizes and the flames start going perfectly straight up and out of the flue the flue connects to chimney that goes up about two stories to give some context live in texas where theres pretty high humidity and right now the outside temperature is about degrees and the inside temperature is about degrees edit thank you for all the helpful answers just want to clarify once open the backdoor one time the flames go up the flue and through the chimney like theyre supposed to and stay that way even if close the door again the flames only come out of the front of the fireplace until open and shut the door one time and then everything works like its supposed to
167250 astronomers find ancient black hole billion times the size of the sun according to the article above we observe this supermassive black hole as it was million years after the formation of the universe and scientists find its extreme specifications mysterious because of the relatively young age of the universe at that time why would the billion solar masses mass value be mysterious unless there was limit of sorts to the rate of mass consumption by black hole naive point why would million years not suffice for this much accumulation keeping in mind that most supermassive stars which form black holes have life spans of few tens of millions of years at most
167282 the center of black hole is singularity by definition singularity has infinite density so how can black hole with different mass or density be described
167311 we can detect very slight fluctuations in the temperature mass distribution when the cmb was released decoupling it is believed that these fluctuations led to the first stars however these hot spots are much to large to have formed directly into stars correct what were the events between decoupling at years and the formation of the first stars at million years am reading this article about it http www astro yale edu larson papers sciam04 pdf although the early universe was remarkably smooth the background radiation shows evidence of small scale density fluctuations clumps in the primordial soup these clumps would gradually evolve into gravitationally bound structures smaller systems would form first and then merge into larger agglomerations the denser regions would take the form of network of filaments and the first starforming systems small protogalaxies would coalesce at the nodes of this network in similar way the protogalaxies would then merge to form galaxies and the galaxies would congregate into galaxy clusters the process is ongoing although galaxy formation is now mostly complete galaxies are still assembling into clusters which are in turn aggregating into vast filamentary network that stretches across the universe this is bit over my head though what does it mean by network of filaments for example
167312 in common experiment you can make paper clip float on water due to the strong surface tension adding just tiny bit of soap immediately destroys the surface tension and lets the paper clip sink at the same time pure water tends not to make stable bubbles with air for example soapy water on the other hand is very good at that isnt the stability of the soap bubble dependent on the surface tension of that soap water mixture why is it that in one experiment the surface tensions drops whereas in the other one it increases where is my mistake in tackling that problem

167888 the way thrust is created by rocket is discussed here how does fire create thrust in rocket if you look at typical rocket say v2 it has two primary tanks one which stores the fuel and the other which stores oxygen is it that the lighter flame doesnt use its own oxygen the reason that it doesnt generate thrust or is it that the thrust is so small that cant feel it or is it something more complicated like the shape of the nozzle

168237 my understanding is that stellar fusion naturally stops at iron because it is energetically unfavourable to grow the nucleus further but iron is only the third most tightly bound nucleus nickel is number one so shouldnt iron favourably fuse with helium
168533 using the following equation left frac times times sin theta right can calcukate the velocity of flow traveling down slope would like to check that the units im using in this equation are correct therefore do some checks ms left frac times times right note is dimensionless if ignore the degree symbol for sin theta this equation makes sense the units on the left and right match up how does this work without ignoring the degree unit would you even consider the degree when doing this note that theta is the angle of slope
168536 ive read in some texts that we cant directly observe black hole in space because not even light can escape from its gravity some of the indirect observational methods mentioned are gravitational lensing and gamma ray outbursts created by swirling matter into the event horizon my question is if black hole is surrounded by glowing matter it should appear just like star except with different spectral signature and it should be fairly easy to detect dont understand the statement if you find an object orbiting around nothing theres likely to be black hole at the center though black hole is invisible the enveloping matter should reveal its identity what am missing here please answer
168546 assuming the spacetime principle if the space is modified the time does too so if the velocity in the space is increase does the time slow down what happens if the speed is the speed of light does the time stops
168684 the answer usually get and im paraphrasing here is that they disappear and are instead absorbed as heat energy but find it hard to believe that the photon simply disappears common sense tells me it must turn into something or other not just simply poof out of existence then again common sense has betrayed me before forgive me if this is obvious high school physics student here whos just learned about light and is greatly confused by all this

169009 im not educated in physics but learned that bell struck in small vacuum chamber will not be heard by people around it in school science lab if it had been surrounded by air there would have been energy propagating outward from the bell in sound wave because this cant happen does the bell vibrate harder from the impact will it break sooner
169209 the electromagnetic spectrum is continuum of wavelengths of light and we have labels for some ranges of these and numerical measurements for many question is the em spectrum continuous such that between two given wavelengths 200nm and 201nm there is an infinite number of distincts wavelengths of light or is there some cut off of precision with which light might exist can light only have wavelengths of whole number when measured in nanometers etc
169257 consider the classical hamiltonian for spring begin equation frac frac frac kx end equation this is one of those simple cases where when you work out the math we find begin equation ddot kx end equation and it makes plain and obvious that the frac frac term has now turned into ddot newtons law so its clear here how the frac frac corresponds to the ddot term and the kx is consistent with newtons law my question does this relationship between frac frac and ddot hold for the quantum mechanical operator by the operator mean this hamiltonian begin equation hat frac frac hat hat end equation its obviously the same format but my suspicion is that it doesnt carry the same relationship to newtons laws because of the fundamental differences between classical and quantum mechanics if am correct that the quantum mechanical operator is unrelated to newtons law can someone explain why given they are of the same format
169275 on few occasions either in bed or sitting around fire with my eyes closed rarely but sometimes see very quick fast flash of white and then with my eyes still closed the flash disappears immediately it happens so fast that sit up and rethink if it was even real but know it is real because have had it happen to me many times in my life have also asked other people if it happens to them and replied back saying that they had experienced the flash before is it possible for neutrino to pass the brain and in response produce the white flash after all the brain is made of water and neutrino detectors are predominantly water tried submitting this question on biology stackexchange and was told that questions like these belonged on the physics stackexhange site
169553 now dont really mean to say that maxwells equations are wrong know maxwells equations are very accurate when it comes to predicting physical phenomena but going through high school and now in college maxwells equations are seen as the equations of electricity and magnetism now its common knowledge among students that while newtons laws are generally accurate when applied to everyday experiences they are also replaced at high velocities by special relativity and general relativity for very large gravitational fields but this is less so the case with maxwells equations have read that maxwells equations are replaced with quantum electrodynamics which to me has all the effect of mere buzzwords since dont know what quantum electrodynamics is as more accurate way of describing electromagnetic waves but what are the limitations of maxwells equations or let me phrase this differently im currently an electrical engineering major know nasa scientists and engineers can still get away with using newtonian physics for their calculations because its that accurate also know however that relativity does have to come into play with gps so in what situation as an electrical engineer would maxwells equations ever fail me when assuming im working on such sufficiently advanced project would have to resort to more accurate ways to describe electromagnetic waves
169730 would like to really understand how the uncertainty principle in qm works from practical point of view so this is my narrative of how an experiment goes and im quickly in trouble we prepare set of many particles in the same state psi as best we can then we start measuring observables and that dont commute on each of the particles when we measure the wave function collapses to an eigenstate of with some probability by accumulating measurements with we obtain statistics and in particular langle psi psi rangle the expected value of to state psi but how do get langle psi psi rangle can measure and simultaneously on one particle even if psi has collapsed to an eigenstate of which is not an eigenstate of and and dont commute what happens how do measure do need to pull in another particle on which ill measure but not this time
169745 have not been able to find clear or decisive answer about this on earth ship sails close hauled when the ship is to some degree or another facing into the wind this is made possible with sails that are rigged along the length of the ship rather than perpendicular to the length is similar thing practically or at least theoretically possible with solar sailing vessel to sail towards star in this manner why or why not
169964 have read fair bit about topological insulators and proximity induced majorana bound states when placing superconductor in proximity to topological insulator ive also read bit about cuprates being related to topological superconductivity if that helps what cant quite understand is what defines and what is pure topological superconductor or is this simply not the case and is topological superconductivity something that can only be achieved by means of proximity effect arrangements general description of what one is would probably be most helpful

170130 the problem states metallic ring of mass and radius falls freely under the influence of gravity in the direction along the negative axis magnetic field lambda where is the coordinate of the center of the ring also exists along the positive axis initially the center of the ring is at the origin the resistance of the ring is the plane of the ring is perpendicular to the axis find the terminal velocity of the ring figured since the question is asking for terminal velocity there should be force acting on the ring in the direction opposite to the gravitational force but the force on small segment of the ring by the magnetic field due to the induced current would be radially inwards hence the total force on the ring by the magnetic field would be zero my question is where would this force arise from

170464 usually relativistic time dilation effects require something traveling near the speed of light but the high speed requirement can be replaced with high distance requirement instead traveling away from distant location will let you observe older distant events than when traveling towards distant location what think this means is if you observe supernova thats at just the right distance away while the earth is traveling away from the event during its orbit then wait half year for when the earth is traveling in the opposite direction youll sweep another slice of space from spacetime that also contains the supernova event you should be able to adjust what distance this works for by waiting for different velocity differences during orbit or sending satellite up to have more control over the velocity differences and wait times do we have any photographed evidence of the same supernova exploding twice by carefully using the time dilation effects of small velocity differences across large distances
170502 most of you if not everybody will agree that the stronger the gravitational pull the faster an object will fall for example on planet with times the gravity of earth any object will hit the ground on that planet much quicker than it would on earth so taking all of these into the equation does it mean that at blackhole an object will fall at an infinite speed because of the infinitely strong gravitational pull of the blackhole
170635 del gave certain solutions to einsteins relativity equations that involved rotating universe or something unusual like that that predicted stable wormholes could exist and therefore time travel if one could travel through wormhole he was genius but obviously many scientists today dont think time travel could exist but his solutions to einsteins equations do supposedly work so could this work by del imply time travel might be possible
170725 if we shoot one electron or photon at time to double slit for long time interference pattern will build up on the other side if the gap between each electron or photon is long enough that they dont interfere it appears that single electron or photon is interfering with itself so is the interference pattern obtained by shooting only one electron or photon its just that we cant see the pattern because its too dim and so we have to shoot many electrons or photons one after the other to make the pattern brighter
170768 think my title sums it up given that we think the dark matter is pseudo spherically distributed and orbits in the galactic potential with everything else then assume that its speed with respect to the sun will have distribution with an rms of few km but the escape velocity at the solar surface is km so does that mean that even though sparse the sun will trap dark matter particles as it moves around the galaxy will it accumulate cloud of dark matter particles by simple bondi hoyle accretion and in the absence of any inelastic interactions have swarm of dark matter particles orbiting in and around it with much higher concentration than the usual interstellar density if so what density would that be edit my initial premise appears to be ill founded since dark matter particle falling into the suns gravity well will gain enough ke to escape again however will there still be gravitational focusing effect such that the dm density will be higher in the sun

170962 im wondering if its possible to send man to the moon using equations consistent with newtonian gravity and without the elaborate tools of einstein gravity are the predictions made by newtonian gravity sufficiently precise to plan successful voyage if not where would the newtonian equations fail and how does einstein gravity correct for these deficits
171107 motivating the non relativistic momentum mathbf mathbf is quite easy it is meant to represent the quantity of motion of the particle and since the mass is one measure of quantity of matter it should be proportional to mass how much thing is moving and should be proportional to velocity how fast and to where it is moving now in special relativity the momentum changes the new quantity of motion becomes mathbf dfrac mathbf sqrt dfrac or using gamma the lorentz factor mathbf gammav mathbf where write gammav to indicate that the velocity is that of the particle relative to the frame in which the movement is being observed the need for this new momentum is because the old one fails to be conserved and because using the old one in newtons second law leads to law which is not invariant under lorentz transformations so the need for new momentum is perfectly well motivated what would like to know is how can one motivate that the correct choice for mathbf is the gammavm mathbf there are some arguments using the mass considering colision requiring momentum to be conserved transform the velocity and then find how mass should transform although this work it doesnt seem natural and it is derived in one particular example on my book theres even something that einstein wote saying that he didnt think it was good idea to try transforming the mass from to gammavm that it was better to simply keep gamma on the new momentum without trying to combine it with the mass so would like to know without resorting to arguments based on transformation of the mass how can one motivate the new form of momentum that works for special relativity
171247 lets say have the lagrangian along with the constraint that equiv vec qt we can then write lambda what is my hamiltonian now is it dot or something different have found at least one example where using the above formula gives different answer then the hamiltonian found by decreasing the degrees of freedom by one rather then using lagrange multipliers
171881 as per wikipedia quantum entanglement is physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently also if we consider bipartite mixed state we say that mixed state is separable if it can be written as rho sum rho otimes rho so if we consider mixed state frac rangle langle frac rangle langle as per the definition of mixed entangled quantum state stated above we can say that given state is not entangled but isnt the measurement in standard basis on 1st particle will determine the outcome of measurement in standard basis of 2nd particle if yes doesnt it mean that given mixed state is entangled am new to quantum mechanics so it might be silly question but it will be great if someone can explain it to me
172068 was just reading some lecture notes about relativistic and quantum mechanics and in the later part of this page the author demonstrates that any relativistic particle collision in the lab reference frame where one particle is at rest and the other is accelerated requires significantly more initial kinetic energy than it would in the center of mass reference frame where both particles are accelerated equally so was wondering why dont we use the center of mass frame accelerate both particles in collision would guess the answer is something simple like aiming 5c proton directly at another 5c proton is much harder than aiming one 9c proton into big block of stationary protons but dont know how accurate accelerators are these days or how many particles are actually involved on each side of typical high energy collision
172076 the reason have always heard to explain the reduction of electric shock when we wear insulating footwear goes as follows when electricity passes from our body to the ground an electric circuit is complete this results in flow of charges resulting in an electric shock however an insulator makes this circuit open by not allowing the current to pass through but when charges enter our body even though they do not flow and go inside the earth they are still present in our body right if theres an excess of electrons we should feel the additional electrons presence regardless of whether those electrons flow through our body or not what am getting wrong
172315 think of sand as lot of very small rocks suppose have pile of rocks each about 1cm in size and the pile is meter tall if pour bucket of water on the rocks most of the water will fall through the rocks and form puddle on the ground on the other hand if have pile of sand one meter tall and pour bucket of water on it the water will stick to the sand and ill have bunch of wet sand and not much water on the ground further the wet sand acts distinctly differently from dry sand for example the angle of repose of wet sand is different from dry sand an hourglass with wet sand it in might not work or would run at different speed from dry hourglass but dont think the angle of repose of pile of wet 1cm rocks is significantly different from that of dry rocks so how small should rocks be before they show wetting properties the way sand does

172739 the common explanation trope for the equivalence principle always has something to do with you being inside an elevator or spaceship and your supposed inability to differentiate say gravity from rocket or free fall from being motionless in empty space for example wikipedia says being at rest on the surface of the earth is equivalent to being inside spaceship far from any sources of gravity that is being accelerated by its engines many other sources say similar things often making broad sweeping generalizations like there is no measurement you can make to distinguish the two scenarios isnt that just plainly wrong gravitational fields arent homogeneous here on the earth clock on the floor runs more slowly than clock on the table and we have clocks precise enough to measure such small differences due to the gravitational gradient but doesnt clock in an accelerating spaceship run at the same rate no matter where in the ship you put it searched the top or so questions about the equivalence principle and found this answer that talks about tidal effects in gravitational fields but the explanation is very confusing as far as can tell it seems to be saying the attraction between the particles that arises as result of slightly different gravity vectors is somehow equivalent to the actual mutual gravitational attraction the particles should have absent the external gravitation field dont see how that could possibly be the case also in that answer is link to this explanation of tidal forces and the equivalence principle which seems to be saying the opposite that tidal forces are in fact distinguishing characteristic between gravitational acceleration and rocket acceleration and that the equivalence principle only exactly applies to small enough points in space over small enough duration where tidal effects are negligible know what seems most correct to me but as im not an expert in this field would an actual expert please shed some light on these varying views of the equivalence principle
172939 since the earth is good conductor of electricity is it safe to assume that any charge that flows down to the earth must be redistributed into the earth in and along all directions does this also mean that if release million amperes of current into the earth every living entity walking barefooted should immediately die
173000 consider the atomic spectrum absorption of hydrogen the bohrs model postulates that there are only certain fixed orbits allowed in the atom an atom will only be excited to higher orbit if it is supplied with light that precisely matches the difference in energies between the two orbits but how precise does precisely mean of course if we need energy to excite the electron to higher energy level and supply photon with just would expect nothing to happen since the electron cannot occupy an orbit between the allowed ones but what if supplied photon with energy 99e or 0001e or some such number what will happen then think that the electron should still undergo excitation precisely because the lines we observe in the line spectrum have some thickness which means that for given transition the atom absorbs frequencies in certain range is my reasoning correct if not why how does bohrs model explain this how about modern theory if im right what is the range of values that an atom can accept for given transition
173085 much of the research ive done on the tacoma narrows bridge disaster of attribute the collapse of the bridge due to aeroelastic flutter not strucural resonance but isnt aeroelastic flutter just special type of resonance that involves in this case the wind and the elastic properties of the bridge what clearly differentiates aeroelastic flutter and resonance that considers wind turbulence as the input excitation

173496 im looking for proof that the electric and magnetic fields in plane wave are perpendicular that doesnt invoke complex and fields havent been able to find one if the proof requires complex fields can you explain why
173639 as we all learn in basic quantum mechanics the first quantization we promote the classical variables to operators say the classical hamiltonian frac 2m vx to frac hbar 2m frac dx vx where we have replaced by hbar frac partial partial in coordinate representation but if the classical hamiltonian of conservative system omega where omega is constant this method fails as the constructed hamiltonian of the form hbar omega frac partial partial is not hermitian what is wrong here
173751 mine line of thoughts goes like this propeller is effectively pushing itself away from molecules of air the best any propeller can do is to create total vacuum in the front of itself the maximum suction pressure of vacuum you can get is equal to the opposite of the atmospheric pressure around right the speed of the air flowing into the vacuumed space in front of the propeller is equal to the speed of sound obviously we are extrapolating the friction of the body of the airplane etc is my line of thoughts at least partially plausible
173768 what is fire is it wave or is it matter where does fire come from does everything burn with fire for example water and some metals dont burn
173790 energy and mass are interrelated as everything has energy could any object be massless for example photon is packet of energy but still it is considered to be massless particle why is it so
174135 let us assume have rod of some mass moment of inertia length and center if apply force on for duration of time it will accelerate forward if apply it elsewhere the body will rotate now my confusion arises here will the body still accelerate as much as it did when was applied on if so why how can it rotate and yet accelerate with the same velocity as that of without rotation where is it getting this extra energy from how can calculate the respective velocities of linear and angular motion given and please cite any reliable sources if possible and state all the formulas
174150 in first course on statistical mechanics the partition function is normally introduced as the normalisation for the probability of particle being in particular energy level frac exp left frac bt right sum exp left frac bt right through various manipulations taking derivatives and so on we can recover the macroscopic thermodynamic variables of the system it seems little fortuitous to me that without specificing more than we can recover so much information about our system especially when it is introduced as normalisation is there better way to view the partition function other than the normalisation of probabilites it just seems pretty amazing that it has so much information encoded about the system when really all it does is ensure that sum
174164 the time taken by capacitor of capacitance in charging circuit with resistance in series with it to accumulate charge is given by the equation tau ln left frac right where tau is the time constant given by tau rc and is the maximum charge the capacitor can have when fully charged in that circuit in order to find the time taken by the capacitor to get fully charged we have to put in the right side of the above equation that gives begin align ln implies ln infty implies infty lim to end align this gives me feeling that capacitor never gets charged fully am right why not
174413 many resources state that light skin pale skin absorbs more uv than dark colour skin doesnt black absorb maximum radiation for an example see this article natural selection therefore favored genetic solution to that problem by evolving to pale skin that absorbs uv more efficiently
174521 is mathrm mathrm mathrm kg how do we define mathrm once was given an assignment where was asked to deduce and write down some physical quantity it turned out that this quantity was in one unit or another so decided to drop the physical units because figured that it didnt matter anyhow but got to thinking if mathrm then we could add units of different dimensions an operation not normally defined like so mathrm does cdot map mathrm to both and is there an established regime of thinking about physical quantities as an abstract algebra perhaps as vector space where formal sums such as mathrm mathrm are allowed would it be improper to drop the units of measurement of mathrm like this in an academic paper
174541 according to the bipm and wikipedia amount of substance as measured in moles is one of the base quantities in our system of weights and measures why get why the mole is useful as unit in fact my question isnt really about the mole at all just mention it because what little information could find generally talked about moles not about amount of substance nor am asking about why its chosen as base quantity and not derived quantity get that any particular choice of bases is more or less arbitrary dont understand why its dimensional quantity at all it is after all just count of things every student is taught to think of it as like dozen only more sciencey cant we just call it dimensionless number no says si molar mass doesnt just have dimensions of mathsf it has dimensions of mathsf cdot mathsf and avogadros number isnt just number its got units of per mole or dimensions of mathsf contrast this with an actual dimensionless quantity plane angle and its unit the radian now you might say that its dimensionless because radians are defined as arc length over radius and so plane angle is just mathsf cdot mathsf cancel out and you have no dimensions that strikes me as arbitrary we could just as easily argue that arc length is really quantity of mathsf cdot mathsf where mathsf is plane angle because its the measurement of quantity that subtends mathsf at distance mathsf but this isnt needed plane angle isnt even derived quantity its non quantity plane angle is accepted as dimensionless why isnt amount of substance as said ive found very little on this question from the wikipedia article on the mole found pdf of an interesting iupac article on atomic weight it acknowledges the argument as does the wikipedia article but dismisses it out of hand by saying essentially of course counting things is way of measuring things so of course we need unit of measurement for it other than that wikipedia as far as can tell touches on eliminating the mole only in the context of eliminating other units as for example in natural systems of units the unified code for units of measure blithely cuts moles from the base units as being just count of things but doesnt go into why si says it is necessary is there any official rationale for the inclusion of amount of substance as dimension failing that can anyone provide or point me to some good reasons why its so special edit thank you all for your input the more ive thought about it the more ive come to feel that theres no reason why count of stuff shouldnt be dimension its clearly different from say dimensionless number included as scale factor and that my unease with the idea comes from simple habit in any case not involving moles it tends to get left out really im now more wondering why angles are considered dimensionless reading before coming here consultative committee for amount of substance ccqm thought maybe committee with this name would be in charge of explaining why amount of substance is needed but no it seems they just deal with standardising it unified code for units of measure wikipedia amount of substance international system of quantities including pdf from bipm linked at bottom which only confirms that amount of substance is one of the base quantities mole unit including the pdf from iupac mentioned above

174746 was wondering what type of experiments were held to identify the number of electrons in an atom for example how do we say that carbon has electrons and magnesium would like someone to give me link to video of this experiment in comment form or answer form because it would be more clear me if saw the experiment rather if someone explained it to me
175188 lets say we have mass on spring being driven by forcing function given hooks law kx and forcing function of ft sin omega we can write frac 2x dt kx sin omega all the physics resources ive come across assume that the motion of the spring follows the applied force and present the solution as some form of sin omega they typically then go onto substitute into the differential equation and obtain frac omega omega this is pretty cool formula really wanted understand why if omega omega becomes negative and our motion is exactly out of phase with our force this is not intuitive to me and in an effort to better understand it decided to run numerical analysis started my mass initially at rest at position zero and to my horror my numerical analysis yielded these results clearly the motion of the mass can not be described by single sine whats going on here after pulling my hair out bit realized that my numeric analysis was in fact correct and it was the analytical solution that was lacking the full solution to our equation of motion is xt sin omega cos omega frac sin omega omega omega and when we setup out initial conditions correctly this analytical solution agrees with the numerical solution our earlier solution is special case of this solution but the initial conditions must be set to very specific values for this to happen so my question is what the heck is going on here is this solution just not important or not relevant it seems to me that unless the initial conditions are exactly right you wont even see the behavior shown in most physics resources in real applications does the solution taught typically just not happen or am missing something
175292 this arises from the question what is the relationship between and which im afraid answered just by looking it up in schutzs book however schutz as he frequently does glosses over details he thinks are irrelevant or too simple to be worth explaining and have realised dont understand an assumption he makes schutz states without proof that if we have an equatorial orbit in schwartzschild metric then independence of the metric of the angle phi about the axis implies that phi is constant in the non relativistic world assume this corresponds to angular momentum being constant in central potential so far so good but why is it the component of the dual vector phi that is constant rather than phi the component phi is presumably not constant since in this case phi phi bonus points for also explaining his similar claim that time independance means that is constant rather than fear that schutz didnt explain because its an insultingly simple question but if someone can provide nice intuitive explanation would be very pleased to read it
175344 in the link below carl sagan described about higher dimension http www youtube com watchv unurelczgc0 and heres description of brian greene http www youtube com watchv v95wjxpmiqg carl sagan explains we can not see the higher dimensions because we are limited to perceive only three dimensions he didnt say dimension can be small or big this explanation completely makes sense but brian greene explains higher dimensions can be tiny and curled up isnt every dimension perpendicular to each of the other dimensions if so then how can dimension be tiny or big want to know which is the right way to imagine higher dimensions
175444 dont understand why it is said that the rest mass of system is not conserved in relativity mean the momentum of system is conserved it remains constant in frame of reference without any external influence also the energy of system is conserved in relativity it doesnt change without any external agency and the rest mass of system is just is constant is constant how can change for example entropy is not conserved in system that means that the entropy of the system will increase spontaneously with time which is really the case but is this true for mass here is the problem from griffiths and exact solution as given in the griffiths two lumps of clay each of rest mass collide head on at 3c and they stick together question what is the rest mass of the composite lump solution in this case conservation of momentum is trivial it is zero before and zero after the energy of each lump prior to the collision is mc sqrt 5mc the energy of the composite lump after the collision is mc since its at rest so the conservation of energy says 5mc 5mc mc and hence 5m notice that this is greater than the sum of the initial masses mass was not conserved in this collision kinetic energy was converted into rest energy so the rest mass increased

176220 assuming an ordinary hinged door without any springs would it take more energy to open it when applying force in the middle of the door point rather than at the end of the door point where the door knob is opening the door should be interpreted as accelerating the door to certain rotational speed my own answer is no since the change in force would be proportional to the distance required to open the door and therefore the total energy would remain the same
176239 the legendre transformation is used to derive the hamiltonian from the lagrangian and it finds many applications in thermodynamics to convert between the different potentials fx rightarrow gu with frac df dx the starting function needs to be convex or concave though what if is globally non convex and non concave has convex as well as concave sections this would lead to multi valued gu as confirmed in the comments to this question you could probably split domain and get multiple one for each section of but ive never seen this done in practice instead people just seem to ignore this problem is this valid and if so why does it work im most interested in the thermodynamic applications us is transformed via frac partial partial to ft st what if us isnt globally convex or concave what are the implications can we guarantee that us will always be convex or why is it possible to ignore this issue in practice
176358 what is the elliptic genus see also witten index in string theory and susy gaugefield theory constructions out of them what does it tell us heuristically and what is its relation to the partition function
176518 in this paper john baez says the actual gauge group of the standard model is su3 times su2 times u1 can someone explain the logic behind this line of thought firstly does this group has some name how can we see that acts trivially on all the particles in the standard model does this factoring change anything or why isnt this real gauge group mentioned anywhere else
176537 what causes the surface of the lake to appear darker in some places firstly know that its not fishes that cause it secondly the dark surfaces move from time to time and thus are not associated with the depth of the water or the structure of the lake bottom lastly may say they are due to kind of ripple distortion what causes this distortion and what is its mechanism please provide more explanation than the wind for example in this photo look at the far area its darker somehow
176650 moving through the other three dimensions necessitates energy but why doesnt moving through time necessitate energy
176731 hope this question isnt too naive but would it theoretically be possible to have black hole with singularities or black holes at the same location if this is possible would there be any significant differences on the effects of space time what am thinking of is if you were to have spinning black hole that has ring as your first singularity and in the center of that ring was yet another singularity with no angular momentum would it be theoretically possible for this structure to exist or would the inner black hole just begin to spin the same direction gaining some the momentum similarly what if you have two spinning black holes with perpendicular ring singularities at the same location and if you wanted to be really crazy add another singularity into the middle of that if there is something am missing or misinterpreting about black holes or singularities please feel free to let me know as am no expert
177049 my understanding has always been that it does from conventional science courses but really thinking about it was wondering if this is really the case to my limited understanding there is theory that there are gravitons that act as particles to pull two different masses together if these gravitons really are the physical particles of gravity then so called vacuum that had gravity wouldnt be vacuum at all real vacuum should lack these particles and thus lack gravity anything in the vacuum should then implode due to its own gravitational attraction within itself if this is the case could we say in real vacuum external gravity does not exist
177113 atomic clocks use cesium beam frequency to determine the length of second this has shown that the period of orbit of the earth is decreasing but what experiment showed that cesium beams period was so terribly consistent did they just run several atomic clocks and note that there was no drift couldnt many things that might change the frequency of one clock also impact the other so this would not work
177297 in lot of quantum mechanics lecture notes ive read the author introduces the notion of so called single particle state when discussing non interacting or weakly interacting particles but none that have read so far give an explicit explanation as to what is exactly meant by this term is it meant that in principle each individual state constituting multi particle system can be occupied by single particle contrary to an entangled state where is impossible to separate the particles such that the state as whole can be de constructed into set of sub states containing only one particle each and each being described by its own hamiltonian sorry to ramble im bit confused on the subject in particular as know that more than one particle can occupy single particle state is the point here that the particles can still be attributed their own individual wave functions and it just so happens that these individual wave functions describe the same state
177588 have just started studying qm and got into some trouble understanding something lets say there is wave function of particle in 1d box leq leq psixt frac sqrt sin left frac pi right frac sqrt sin left frac pi right then if we measure the energy the probability of getting the energy associated with sin frac pi is left frac sqrt right frac and the probability of measuring the energy associated with sin left frac pi right is left frac sqrt right frac so the magnitude of frac sqrt frac sqrt determines the probability but what is the meaning of the phase to me as someone who measures energy ill get the same thing if psixt frac sqrt sin left frac pi right frac sqrt sin left frac pi right so why does the phase matter if it matters how do know to which phase the wave function collapsed after the measurement
177734 if so what are some differences like between iron and gold edit sorry need to clarify by difference mean do they retain their chemical properties from more normal temperatures like is gold plasma more dense than irons is the iron plasma more reactive than gold stuff like that
178061 always see that room temperature of text corresponds to an energy of bt approx frac text ev but shouldnt it be frac bt since the molecules in the air have three degrees of freedom for translation and not two is there deeper meaning to neglect the
178169 suppose apply two vertical but opposite forces with the same magnitude in body like is shown in the picture according to newtons second law the center of mass shouldnt accelerate since the sum of the forces in the system are zero however believe that in the situation shown in the picture the body would start rotating around point which is not its center of mass hence the center of mass would accelerate what is wrong with my reasoning
178371 so because im hardcore person risked all this afternoon by going out in the wind the rain and the cold to construct willow den yes it seems menial task but it was actually quite thought provoking some pieces of willow were harder to push into the ground than others and to try and force them in id sometimes end up hanging off of them but other times id just push with all my strength placing my body above the hole and pushing down my feet still firmly planted on the ground now was wondering which of these two methods is better for sticking the stick into the ground ignoring the fact that by hanging from it it is likely to topple which method help me be more efficient in my future den building exploits in other words can you ever exert more downwards force than your weight if so then im guessing pushing down would be the better method and if not then hanging from the stick putting all your weight into it would exert the most possible downwards force heres what willow den looks like source raisingsparks com
178417 know that cannot do this because of conservation of energy so am looking for an answer as to why this will not work so by my understanding of einsteins whole famous mc thing it is possible to turn matter into energy and energy into matter so what if you were to create space station way up high and run wire down to earth then pump some energy up it the space station would then turn that energy into matter and let it drop down to earth people down at earth would harvest the kinetic energy somehow then turn the matter back into energy pump it back up then repeat the process the result would be the energy they started with plus the kinetic energy where is the flaw in this reasoning im guessing it might take energy for the electrons to fight gravity up to the space station
178601 when we send satellite into space using rocket logically we consider the shortest path which is straight line perpendicular to earths surface my question is do rocket takes the shortest path to reach outer space or stray off intentionally at an angle from earths surface
178710 does that mean that electrons are infinitely stable the neutrinos of the three leptons are also listed as having mean lifespan of infinity
178826 so today was trying to derive an expression for the number of radioactive atoms remaining after time if began with atoms in total at first tried to assume that they had an average lifetime and work from there but my friend dropped hint and found it much easier to assume that each atom had specific chance in small time element dt to decay after some manipulation arrived at an exponential decay formula which was great however it got me to thinking about the concept of average lifetime also managed to find an expression for average lifetime relating it to the chance single atom will decay in differential time element if had group of atoms that have an average lifetime of say seconds after seconds has elapsed what is the average lifetime of the remaining atoms dont think can arbitrarily choose some reference time to begin ticking away at the atoms remaining time does that mean at any point of time that their average lifetime or expected lifetime is always constant and never actually diminishes as time goes on
178831 people say yes and give wonderful example of vacuum tubes crts but can we really say that vacuum as in space is good conductor of electricity in very basic sense
178837 at my recent lesson on kinematics my teacher taught about inertia and momentum this is what she said inertia characteristic of an object that resists changes to its state of motion momentum the resistance of an object to change in its state of motion my problem is what is the difference between both mean they look the same and why does inertia not have unit but momentum does
178865 this question actually came about from discussion of another question posed here the neutron is known to be comprised of an electron and proton and there are observations that the neutron can be created by these particles or alternately decay into these particles furthermore the stability of the neutron is vastly improved if it remains bound within the nucleus so presumably the nuclear force helps to maintain the neutrons stability once outside the nucleus the neutron has much harder time keeping itself together and once again becomes proton and electron and just to keep matters and this post more simple and shorter im neglecting the additional fact that the electron antineutrino is also produced in the decay now getting to my question im wondering why we have to consider the neutron as separate particle within itself rather than proton electron system of particles is there an experiment that refutes this way of looking at things note im asking for an experiment or set of experiments not just theories
178944 my question in the title might not be very descriptive so am re writing it here if there is truck in motion and it has stack of hay lets suppose on the back now if the truck comes to sudden stop will it stop faster if the force exerted by the truck on hay had overcome the friction force another wording will it be faster if the hay slips forward or will it stop faster if the hay remains constant edit do not know where everyone is getting tied down option or not the hay isnt tied down sorry for misguiding there are two situations it slides on the trucks back or it doesnt slide on trucks back and in which situation does the truck stop faster
178960 is there some way to derive mc can understand that energy in something is proportional to its mass but the part have no idea it seems like the way the units are going it would end up as kg which think is the unit for newtons not energy and why is there no constant of proportionality did einstein just set it up perfectly so that there wouldnt be one
179046 assuming inter universal see here travel is possible can perfectly mathematically describable universe exist inside multiverse if it could would that mean that the multiverse is mathematically describable as well perfectly mathematically describable universe would be perfectly predictable as well can one predict the future of such universe when inter universal travel is possible and the multiverse is not perfectly mathematically describable
179082 most of us have heard of einsteins amazing equations which describe the universe around us yet only some of us understand what the equations are actually saying what are these equations actually saying and is there simple relatively way to derive them here they are from wikipedia mu nu dfrac mu nu mu nu lambda dfrac pi mu nu have vague notion of what tensor is it describes things as an array and higher orders define more complex transformations but dont understand what all of these tensors are doing and why is there in the equation
179180 if wanted to find the coefficients of linear transformation between vectors in the basis for spin paticles lets say for starters we are not even looking for unitary transform begin equation rangle rangle rangle rangle end equation should look for coefficients or should use otimes with and in mathbb which would be only coefficients but with structure imposed by the structure of the kronecker product begin equation otimes left begin array cc end array right end equation or should use edit this is wrong read lubos answer below begin equation otimes otimes mathbb mathbb otimes end equation in which case there is again only coefficients to find but the structure seems to be different note that this last form is what we use when figuring out the total hamiltonian for system of particles am very confused about this actually im guessing that transformations that can be written otimes are subset of all possible transformations with all coefficients free but im still confused about the last expressions above if had to apply the operator otimes to rangle would not be confident about which expression to use for otimes
179309 ok this might sound like silly question but was wondering when particles protons are smashed together in the lhc why do they break up into dozens of other particles as opposed to just bouncing off of each other elastically im guessing the full explanation is probably going to involve some fairly in depth quantum analysis of particle interactions but can anyone explain it in fairly straightforward way that someone who isnt an expert in qm can understand presumably there will be some threshold energy level below which this doesnt happen for example assume protons in lower energy hydrogen plasma will be bouncing off each other all the time
179353 as far as am aware bell rung in perfect vacuum would only lose energy and stop ringing due to friction between the bell and the hanging mechanism due to the lack of air resistance therefore would it theoretically be possible to suspend bell between two opposing magnets or another suspension device that does not require physical contact and when struck have it ring forever there would be the issue of the bell moving to one side when struck unless it was immobilised on all four sides by magnets would the magnetic force act as dampener and stop the bell from ringing or would it keep ringing indefinitely
179388 let me start by saying that understand the definitions of the lie and covariant derivatives and their fundamental differences at least think do however when learning about killing vectors discovered dont really have an intuitive understanding of the situations in which each one applies and when to use one over the other an important property of killing vector xi which can even be considered the definition is that mathcal xi where is the metric tensor and mathcal is the lie derivative this says in way that the metric doesnt change in the direction of xi which is notion that makes sense however if you had asked me how to represent the idea that the metric doesnt change in the direction of xi would have gone with nabla xi where nabla is the covariant derivative since as far as know the covariant derivative is in general relativity the way to generalize ordinary derivatives to curved spaces but of course that cannot be it since in general relativity we use the levi civita connection and so nabla it would seem that mathcal xi is be the only way to say that the directional derivative of vanishes why is this if didnt know that nabla would there be any way for me to intuitively guess that doesnt change in the direction of xi should be expressed with the lie derivative also the lie derivative is not just directional derivative since the vector xi gets differentiated too is this of any consequence here
179523 ok so im asking this in physics because im currently working through part of srednickis text on qft even though its really maths question in srednickis chapter on non abelian gauge theory he introduces the generators of lie group at the moment were only analysing sun which is defined by dagger and detm for all in sun and the corresponding conditions on the generators of the group are dagger and rm tr for all in mathfrak su then what dont understand is that srednicki tells me that we should normalise our generators so that rm tr frac delta ij so presumably this arises because our set of generators is basis for the tangent space of sun at the identity and we choose it to be orthogonal and then need condition to normalise the lengths of all of the basis vectors why did the condition srednicki gave do that and where did we input that the vectors are orthogonal
179535 looked on wikpedia for information on the uncertainty principle but after reading it still had no idea know it has something to do with how many things you can hold at some spot for some amount of time maybe this is inspired by this question
179574 am trying to understand in the symmetry factor of the cactus diagram that appears in the bottom of page in peskins book this is the diagram in question notice that we are in phi theory in the book it is claimed that the symmetry factor of the diagram is times dot times dot dot times dot times where it says that the comes from interchanging the vertices the first dot from the placement of contractions in the vertex the following dot dot from the placement of contractions in the vertex the last dot from the placement of contractions in the vertex and the final from the interchange of contractions it is this last that dont understand can you be more explicit on where this comes from
179592 im sorry for the triviality of my questions why is bar psi theta bar psi where theta is real number used as the global gauge transformation why theta whats the physical significance or benefit why is bar psi thetax psi the local gauge transformation what does theta being function of instead of real number change such that it no longer applies globally the dirac lagrangian is globally but not locally invariant how can this be is local not subset of global as far as invariance is concerned
179595 it is obvious that dimensional analysis can be used to derive many classical mechanics equations excluding constants as long as all the dependent quantities are known my question is whether this is an accepted method to derive formulas or is calculus is must if so can it be used in advanced areas such as quantum mechanics and relativistic physics
179636 is it possible to derive begin equation hat hat times hat end equation from the angular momentum algebra begin equation hat hat hbar epsilon ijk hat end equation have read somewhere that commutation relations of the form begin equation ib epsilon ijk end equation admit natural rewriting in terms of cross products but there werent any details about this statement
179671 is linear operator acting on hilbert space of dimension to the trace of linear operator is defined as sum of diagonal entries of any matrix representation in same input and output basis of but if is linear operator acting on otimes and want to take partial trace over the first second system it makes sense to me when the operator is expressed in dirac notation eg linear operator acting otimes where is dimensional hilbert space in dirac notation is ab rangle langle rangle langle tr al ab rangle langle tr bl ab rangle langle here rangle rangle is an orthonormal basis for but how is the partial trace found and defined in terms of the matrix representation of the linear operator does the input and output basis have to be the same to define partial trace similar to definition of trace
180698 this is question about the relativistic mass concept which am having trouble understanding mainly because of the scenario below simple scenario suppose gram of matter is accelerated to the speed of light at this speed the relativistic mass is times greater than the rest mass if this matter collides with stationary quantity of grams of antimatter will the two masses annihilate completely with each other or will the matter just annihilate grams worth of antimatter if the latter is true then what exactly am overlooking about the relativistic mass concept that makes the former incorrect
180998 yesterday we started relativity on our physics class and my professor taught us few concepts we did some examples on how things changed by looking them from different reference systems and paradox came to my mind from an example he did on the blackboard suppose that we have bug inside hole and suppose that the height of the bug is this hole is meters deep theres man outside the hole that wants to kill the bug with nail of length with obviously its not possible for him to kill the bug by trying to push the nail in the hole however if the nail moves really fast from its reference system the hole will have height and if it moves fast enough then it will happen that so he finally could kill the bug on the other hand the bug knows that from his reference system the nail will have lenght so it would never reach him is it possible to quantify the problem how is it possible that the nail reach the bug from its reference system and from the bugs reference system its even smaller than before
182302 if you have drop bar magnet through coil so that it goes all the way through was told the graph of emf induced in the coil vs time looks something like this emf induced is on axis time is on axis the area of the pink part and the blue part are equal sorry that they dont look equal in my diagram understand why the blue part looks more stretched than the pink part the magnet is accelerating what dont understand is the direction of the blue part it is opposite negative to the pink part positive why does the pole induce an emf in the opposite direction to the one induced by the pole when bar magnet falls through coil the field lines at the pole and pole are pointing in the same direction so the induced emf should continue increasing in the pink part rather than turning and going below zero because the field from the pole is complemented by the field from the pole which is cutting the flux in the same direction as the one from the pole please explain in layman terms thanks note layman terms means you can use stuff from high school physics left right hand rules lenzs law etc but not calculus
182309 was thinking about magnetism as product of special relativity and the result of this approach to the magnetic monopoles so if magnetism is product of electricitylike electricity from another point of viewthen why do we need monopoles to existi know that many theories predict the existence magnetic monopoles but am referring specifically to the concept of classical relativistic magnetism and magnetic monopolesso do not give me answers that are mainly based on what other theories predict edit why do we need electric and magnetic monopoles to describe electromagnetism if the two are the same thing from another moving frame of referenceand if we do not need magnetic monopoleswhy is there even place for them to exist in relativistic electromagnetism edit know that the mathematics of the theory allow for magnetic monopoles but the essence of the question is the following if work from one frame of reference and change to any other frame of reference there are no sources of magnetism that can be related to magnetic monopoles
182668 question in my revision guide explain why the mass of tree cannot be converted directly into energy the answer explains that the tree contains particles but not their corresponding anti particles so the particles cannot annihilate to create energy the question arises do you always need matter and antimatter to create energy or can energy be created from matter alone note if you are going to use equations would highly appreciate an intuitive explanation alongside them because im only in ap physics and dont understand all the higher physics stuff yet
182686 to clarify my question further ill use practical example here is the simplest paper plane design could think of it is rectangular thick drawing paper with weight attached at the middle of one of the long sides used paper clip holding metal key then perform this simple experiment hold the sheet of paper at the tail with approximately nose down attitude and simply let it go that is there is no initial velocity if the weight has the proper mass the sheet of paper glides gracefully forwards in fact was quite surprised that such crude design behaves so well what bothers me is that can not explain to myself why the plane has such behavior heres the way try to analyze it which should be wrong since it does not stand to the facts the plane is drawn as seen from the side since the wing is of very simple rectangular shape the center of pressure should be in its center on the other hand by placing the weight at the nose we have moved the center of mass little forward which is said to be necessary for longitudinal stability of an airplane at moment 0s when let go of the plane there are no other forces acting on it except gravity the plane gains little velocity downwards and immediately the pressure forces begin to act ive drawn the total pressure force and for clarity decomposed it into lift and drag components the magnitudes and directions are only illustrative the lift component explains why the plane starts to gain forward velocity if the forces act in this way then the pressure force should create torque around the center of mass and rotate the plane counterclockwise from the perspective of the drawing but in reality the exact opposite happens the plane rotates clockwise and continues to gain forward speed we know that in airplanes the tail is used to produce torque which cancels the torque of the main wing but there is nothing here to cancel it in fact the torque should act until the angle of attack is nullified and only the drag component remains that is how dart or an arrow will fall if dropped in the same way the difference between dart and the plane above is that the center of mass of the former is much further away from the center of pressure but still dont understand where is that clockwise torque coming from and how it gets cancelled later when the plane gains enough forward velocity and achieves pitch stability edit addon thanks everyone for the answers since the bending of the paper really adds much complexity to the analysis made the plane from firm cardboard as you can see from the following footage the wing is also square now since it is considerably heavier than before it does not glide so far but still the effect is the same now with the wing curvature out of the picture the explanation should lie in what peter suggests that the center of lift is not at the center of the wing but closer to the nose something like this why the lift center is not at the center but at 4th chord is quite unclear to me but ill try and read about it then the last thing that would like to know would be how the wing flies in more or less stable angle of attack or at least in some oscillating mode the explanation would be easy if this 4th rule is not exactly solid and the point of pressure can move forwards and backwards in function of the angle of attack and or velocity then if it moves very close to the the moment will tend to zero if it moves behind the the torque will be ccw the nose will drop and then the pitch oscillations could be explained but is this really the case or the physics are much more complex for such simplification
182688 imagine if you will there exists somewhere out there supermassive planet for some reason this planet is only shell of its former existence and all that is left is crust of substantial size to keep it from collapsing in on itself lets imagine it is stable at thick now this planet was huge how large you ask large enough that the remaining shell is still able to maintain gravity well strong enough to keep you anchored to the surface pretty neat huh well since this is sight to be seen by everyone you stroll along and not looking where you are going you tumble into chasm and straight down into hole that permeates the thickness of the shell as you are falling down and down and down you think at what point do stop falling down and start falling up and would be able to retain the velocity since gravity is conservative force and fall back through another hole on the surface on the opposite side where would the center of gravity even exist mean aaaaahhhhhhh what say you browsers and scientists stretch of the imagination sure but is it physically possible could there exists configuration similar to this where gravity could be concentrated to point but still allow free travel up to the focus
182836 lets say we have sticks both meter long we put both of them on the ground vertically to the top of one of them we attach weight then we tip both of them over and let them fall assume that there is no air resistance and that the lower ends of the sticks do not slide against the floor which one falls first would be correct in guessing that the one with the weight falls slower due to having higher center of gravity edit in case youre wondering where this question came from was pondering whether having passenger on the back of motorcycle would increase or decrease the time it takes to tip over in the case balance is lost at very low speed

183414 the three generators of su2 satisfy the commutation relations pm pm quad 2j the three generators of su11 satisfy the commutation relations pm pm quad 2k now let us define it is apparent that so defined satisfy the su11 algebra does this mean that su11 is actually equivalent to su2 where is the argument wrong
183501 was watching documentary on youtube regarding quantum physics when it introduced the wavelengths of light emitted did bit more research over the internet and believe understand the gist of why each atom gives off different colors heres brief summary of what ive read an atom of particular element has several shells of electrons and each shell is different energy when the atoms are heated up some of the electrons can jump up to shells with higher energy but they dont stay there very long when the electrons fall down again to lower energy shell they give off that energy as photon particle of light the amount of energy of the photon given off is the difference in energy between the two shells and determines the wavelength of the light with all that taken into consideration why is it that molecule isnt combination of its component atoms more precisely how is the color of molecule determined
183527 the question is bit unrealistic with its circumstances but lets assume there is bucket of ice cooled down to about absolute zero and is about km away all around the sun from sun and moving with 1000km sec what will be if that all water with mass of sun reaches the sun update basically have read about this in gizmodo http gizmodo com could the sun be extinguished by bucket of water just but did not agreed thats why have decided to ask about this phenomena here hoping to find out more precise answer
183882 assume particle in 3d euclidean space its kinetic energy frac left dot dot dot right need to change to spherical coordinates and find its kinetic energy frac left dot dot theta sin theta dot phi right its well known that sin theta cos phi sin theta sin phi cos theta way of doing it is taking the time derivatives arriving with different terms with some squares then open it arriving at different terms majority of them with sine or cossine multiplications then to cancel out some terms somehow to arrive in this neat term expression for kinetic energy in spherical coordinates in short lot of work just to arrive in simple expression here is my question is there shorter way or even better is there an effortless way

184186 we know that different poles of magnet attract each other but dont know why this happens why similar poles doesnt attract what is difference between similar poles and different poles
184225 my apologies up front for the naive question and my rudimentary understanding but should be delighted if someone would enlighten me the question has to do with the application of the conservation of momentum when considering time as fourth spacial dimension ill explain my understanding of time first then pose the question in that context time as fourth spacial dimension understand time to be fourth spacial dimension through which we travel in one direction only at constant pace such that in one seconds time we will be 3x108 metres further along the time dimension than we are now momentum vs annihilation it strikes me that although the pace of travel along such time dimension is seemingly fixed at it could also be zero in other words an object that is annihilated will stop travelling through the time dimension in classical physics the kinetic energy released from loss of momentum is given by mv2 as our hypothetical object had previously been travelling at through the time dimension and is now travelling at zero the kinetic energy released would be mc2 however in relativistic physics the energy associated with annihilation is given by mc2 questions couple of questions why isnt the loss of kinetic energy mc2 equal to the energy released on annihilation mc2 am clearly missing something in my rudimentary knowledge but the two equations are intriguingly close does that lend weight to my opening premise that we are travelling at fixed pace along fourth spacial dimension which we perceive as time thank you for listening looked elsewhere on se physics and couldnt find anything similar but apologise if this has been asked before stuart have deliberately avoided the terms speed and velocity as they are with respect to time and hence struggle with applying them in this context
184277 in my gcse physics class today was doing revision for my upcoming gcses and we came to parallax measurements as before my teacher explained that two measurements are taken six months apart as the earth moves around the sun my question is as my teacher couldnt answer how is the movement of the star being measured and that of the backdrop of more distant stars accounted for when taking measurements surely if the star has moved further or closer away during the six month period the measurement would be innacurate
184317 whenever we switch on bulb it takes almost no time to glow up but we know that the atoms of solid are tightly packed and there is very little space between them so how the electrons travel through them irrespective of so much blockages in the conductor
184374 we know that lightning rod or lightning conductor is metal rod or metallic object mounted on top of an elevated structure and if we look closely most of them have sharp point at the top what is the reason for this sharp point
184474 where do the electrons go in alpha decay do electrons follow the alpha particle and make stable helium or does the larger daughter nucleus become an anion also what do the electrons do in the mixture of fission and alpha decay with beryllium it decays into two alpha particles and lonely electrons or do you get two helium atomsif someone could add an entry to holocron it would be greatly appreciated thanks
184659 the difference in using distance vs displacement is demonstrated in this example work force distance if carry an object to and fro metres the work done would be force metres and work force displacement if carry an object to and fro metres the work done would be force metres in this context which should be more accurate representation or formula note that force and displacement are vectors and distance as scalar
184898 everyone who has been interested in modern science has heard explanations certainly simplifications of general relativity mostly that space is curved the analogy with rubber sheet is popular in such an analogy orbiting planets are said to be naturally following straight line in curved space assuming that is not an oversimplification would it mean that orbits are loops generated in space by massive objects also if we consider spacetime as curved structure thus lines are not necessarily straight what would be the meaning of momentum in such frame
184947 when computing partition functions for classical systems with particles with given hamiltonian ive seen some places writing it as dfrac 3n int beta hpq dpdq where the integral is over the available phase space now in my book there is not this factor 3n where this factor comes from why do we need to include it there
185110 have heard virtual particles pop in and out of existence all the time most notable being the pairs that pop out beside black holes and while one gets pulled away but wouldnt this actually violate the conservation of energy
185231 we have seen that rainbows looks so colorful as we are only able to see only the visible light but do they also have ultraviolet bands and infra red bands that we are unable to see know someone has already asked the same question but am concern about the specific ultraviolet and infrared bands only rather than any other wavelength
185298 lets say the earth is hollow and you are in the center of it same mass except all of it is on the outside like beach ball if you move slightly to one side now your distance is closer to that side therefore stronger gravitational force however at the same time you have more mass now on the other side at what rate would you fall which direction also is there scenario where depending on the radius of the sphere you would fall the other direction or towards the empty center
185452 the surface of golf ball has about more surface area than similar sphere due to its dimples so my question is simple given identical radius ideal black body material and temperature would this increased surface area allow black body golf ball to radiate more than its smooth counterpart id like to know if the golf ball will be able to radiate its energy more quickly than the smooth sphere so total power radiated away from the objects is what im interested in by radiated away from the object mean not toward it this is energy lost by the object per unit time there is no coolant medium advection convection or conduction to separate object radiation only
185509 according to energy mass conversion law mass can be converted to energy so is it possible to convert dark matter into dark energy
185519 if there were stable enough mesons similar to protons and neutrons could they capture electrons to form exotic elements if not why is this not possible
185579 my question is simple in ideal situation at constant temperature we know that normal appliances like filament bulb has straight voltage vs current graph meaning its resistance is constant or voltage is directly proportional to current now we also have bulbs of desired power available eg 10w 20w 100w bulbs etc since understand that power current the power for bulb can not be constant if its resistant is assumed constant normal mathematical thinking can confirm that so what does it means when we say the certain bulb is 10w bulb does it simply means that it would consume times energy at given voltage if it replaces 5w bulb
185630 understand that in general homogeneity is the physical attribute of being uniform in composition of the same form at every point but im slightly confused when it is used in cosmology as there seems to be an overlap with the notion of isotropy direction independence ive read that in cosmological terms homogeneous means that the universe looks the same at every point at given instant in time implying that it has uniform density on large scales and is such that the same laws of physics apply universally however isotropy means that at given point at given instant in time the universe looks the same in every direction this seems to overlap somewhat with the concept of homogeneity is the idea that homogeneity means that if an observer observes the universe to look particular way from their vantage point that it has certain physical properties then another observer at any other point in the universe will make the the same observations and conclude that it has the same physical properties the point being that both of them could observe anisotropies and thus the universe could potentially be homogeneous but not isotropic the reverse does not hold however as if both observe the universe to be isotropic the it is necessarily homogeneous sorry for the long windedness of this question its just been bugging me for while
185939 have heard both that planck length is the smallest length that there is in the universe whatever this means and that it is the smallest thing that can be observed because if we wanted to observe something smaller it would require so much energy that would create black hole or our physics break down so what is it if there is difference at all
186034 to be more specific suppose hydrophilic infinite plate is stuck into semi infinite region of water above the water is semi infinite region of air when the plate is stuck into the water vertically the contact angle is alpha as shown in the figure below needless to say the menisci on both sides are symmetric but what will happen when the plate is inclined for an angle beta will the contact angle alpha remain unchanged the meniscus on which side will be higher
186170 in classical mechanics we describe the evolution of particle giving its trajectory this is quite natural because it seems particle must be somewhere and must have some state of motion in quantum mechanics on the other hand we describe the evolution of particle with its wave function psixt which is function such that psixt is probability density function for the position random variable in that case solving the equations of the theory instead of giving the trajectory of the particle gives just statistical information about it up to there it is fine these are just mathematical models the model from classical mechanics has been confirmed with experiments in some situations and the quantum mechanics model has been confirmed with experiments in situations classical mechanics failed what is really troubling me is does the fact that the quantum mechanics model has been so amply confirmed implies particle has no trajectory know some people argue that particle is really nowhere and that observation is what makes it take stand but to be sincere dont swallow that idea it always seemed to me that it just reflects the fact that we dont really know what is going on so quantum mechanics implies that particle has no trajectory whatsoever or particles do have well defined trajectories but the theory is unable to give any more information about then than just probabilities
186199 electric sparks tend to appear blue or purple or white in color why
186323 question what is the physical reason without any maths that the derivative of wavefunction except with infinite potentials has to be continuous other info know that in the classical wave case it is because otherwise an infinitesimal mass would feel an infinite acceleration but since since the wavefunction is not physical dont think direct analogy can be made
186869 was carrying couch with my flatmate yesterday and started thinking about this often when carrying objects like this one person will be taller and has thus lifted his end of the couch higher than the other persons additionally one can intentionally lift his end of the couch higher for comfort my question is in situation is one person carrying more weight than the other
187076 update regarding duplicate this question is not duplicate of another question sure the situation in both the questions is same and yes both questions ultimately provide methodology to solve the problem and finding the correct value of friction but the moderator should realize that here was not asking for method to solve for friction the problem was that did not even realize that will have to solve for friction had solved lot of such problems way back in school and had got into habit of assuming static friction to be the equal and opposite to whatever force is applied against friction upto maximum limit of friction this was blunder made and this is what made it appear like paradox moreover as it turns out asked the same problem to few friends of mine and many of them made the same mistake so essentially the another problem is just asking for general methodology to solve such problems while this problem is like puzzle which presents the user methodology of solving the problem by considering different systems and the contradictions that arise due to them believe user who knows the general methodology presented in the other question is susceptible to the confusion paradox that this problem presents original question this is familiar problem with the setting as given below mu is the coefficient of friction now with the given applied force of 10n and taking 10m we know that the maximum friction force between and can be 30n since 10n is less than the maximum friction force 30n friction force will be 10n and the blocks will therefore move together the acceleration of the combined system will therefore be frac now if we only consider the block and create its free body diagram we see that in the horizontal direction there is only one force force applied by block due to friction and this friction is 10n now if we calculate the acceleration of block we find that frac this is paradoxical how come the value of acceleration comes out to be different when we only consider the second block in our problem
187098 one way that second quantization is motivated in an introductory text qft schwartz is the general solution to lorentz invariant field equation is an integral over plane waves fourier decomposition of the field each term of the plane wave satisfies the harmonic oscillator equation therefore each fourier component is interpreted as harmonic oscillator in ordinary qm the th energy level of each fourier component is now interpreted as particles everything in looks like sensible application of ordinary qm to field but how did come about what is the justification
187254 if the lenses in camera are not set correctly the intended subject will be out of focus in the resulting image there seems to be no loss of information here the photons are just steered to the wrong ccd element if we knew the exact specification and configuration of the lenses would it be possible to apply tranform on the image to see the subject in focus sharpening filters are often used to improve out of focus images but suspect much better result could be possible if the physics of the optics were considered

187508 one of the professors in our department asked the following question on quantum mechanics exam write me quantum mechanics question below if can answer it you will get points and if cannot you will get now wonder whether there is such question or not what mean is are there any open questions in the formalism of quantum mechanics is qm complete theory as it is
187917 ive heard many scientists when giving interviews and the like state that if one were falling into black hole massive enough that the tidal forces at the event horizon werent too extreme that you wouldnt notice or feel anything and so forth thinking about this for few minutes it seems to be quite wrong if youre falling feet first for example as your feet cross the horizon your brain can no longer receive any information from them as the information would have to travel faster than light once you are entirely within the horizon no part of your body closer to the singularity can send any sort of signal to any part of your body that is further away for the same reason even bloodflow would stop as blood that is pumped downward towards your feet could never be pumped back up again in other words inside the event horizon is series of even more event horizons like the layers of an onion infinitely thin am missing something important
188418 im learning about work in my dynamics class right now we have defined the work on particle due to the force field from point to point as the curve integral over the force field from point to from math know that if vector field has potential we only need to evaluate the potential at point minus the potential at point to get the result of the curve integral in the text that im reading its explained that if the integral over force field is path independent then the force field rm grad where is the potential why is it defined as the negative gradient doesnt one determine the potential from mathematically why do we impose the sign on the potential
188650 this is duplicate of this question on space exploration se so why would ask it again here read below the question reads we often say that the planets orbit the sun which is usually reasonable approximation but in reality both sun and the planets orbit the center of mass center of gravity of the whole solar system not the center of the sun suggest that it doesnt make much sense to say that the planets orbit the barycenter of the solar system my question is then am wrong here are some arguments considering only the body problem planet sun we know that the orbits are ellipses with the other body at one focus in that sense we say that the body orbits the sun even though the orbit is elliptical the same problem can be viewed as object whose mass is the reduced mass orbiting the barycenter of the system again it makes sense to say that the small body orbits the big one however as we start considering third body or more as perturbation in the restricted problem the parameters of the ellipse are now time dependent as it is perturbative approach the solution is still close to the initial ellipse my argument derives from this what role does the center of mass of that or more body problem plays the perturbed solution is still based on the initial
188673 always see the label and it says 350gs withstandable what would put this over 350gs is it even possible to hit 350gs of force to hard drive
188796 alright guys so attracted you with the title now to preface the question am fully aware of the work of copernicus as well as the concepts of heliocentrism and barycentric coordinates have masters degree in engineering and have taken many course in dynamics and kinematics it is with this experience that this question arises when studying bodies in motion it is customary to pick stationary reference frame for the basis of your calculations since the sun is extremely massive compared to the rest of the planetary bodies the barycenter of the solar system the stationary origin of choice is extremely close to and often inside the sun hence why we commonly say that the planets all revolve around the sun although this certainly simplifies drawings of the planetary orbits allowing for mostly non intersecting ellipsoids in modeling the base reference frame is for all intents and purposes arbitrary all motion is relative to its observer so whos to say we cannot define the origin to be at the center of earth sure children would no longer be able to make working models out of hangers and styrofoam balls but wouldnt the equations of motion remain the same have been searching online for video or gif that illustrated this principle but was unable to find anyone who took the time to do so id be very interested in seeing what the orbits actually looked like if we re defined the stationary reference frame from the barycenter to the center of the earth im sure the orbits would look pretty rad much like into this solar system orbit video is there something im missing that would theoretically preclude us from doing so edit ah hah finally found video that shows this simulation

189060 was reading book on differential geometry in which it said that problem early physicists such as einstein faced was coordinates and they realized that physics does not obey mans coordinate systems and why not when am walking from school to my house am walking on 2d plane the set of mathbb times mathbb reals the path of plane on the sky can be characterized in 3d parameters point on ball rotates in spherical coordinates current flows through an inductor via cylindrical coordinates why do we need coordinate free description in the first place what things that exist can be better described if we didnt have coordinate system to describe it
189181 was going through fluid dynamics and came upon this section on the shape of liquid surface in rotating cylindrical vessel the working in the book is something like this it considers mass of water on the surface of the rotating liquid at distance from its axis of rotation it takes into account pseudo force cdot cdot omega radially outwards and its weight force mg it then proceeds to calculate the net force and the angle it makes with the vertical from there through basic integration it gets the equation of the surface of liquid dfrac cdot omega 2g get this working but if were to view the same rotation through an inertial framehow would proceed mean there wouldnt be any pseudo force rather centripetal acceleration of same magnitude radially inwards this is where am facing certain doubts the forces on the liquid would be the centripetal force inwards and the weight force downwards the net force would therefore be in different directionand consequently the slope of the surface at that point would be in different direction how is it possible for the same surface to have two different shapes in two different frames would be obliged if someone could help me out by pointing out the flaw in my understanding

189600 why and how does negative velocity exist have read on the internet about negative velocity but still dont understand how it can even exist since time is positive and so is length by doing some math came to the conclusion it cant and should not exist and yet there are so many papers and videos trying to explain it
189653 was reading schutz first course in general relativity on page he argued that the metric tensor is symmetric ds sum alpha beta eta alpha beta dx alpha dx beta text note that we can suppose eta alpha beta eta beta alpha text for all alpha text and beta text since only the sum eta alpha beta eta beta alpha text ever appears in the above equation when alpha neq beta dont understand his argument if someone can explain why would really appreciate it
190308 what do we know about accretion rates of micro black holes suppose relative small black hole mass about kilograms would be thrown into the sun eventually this black hole will swallow all matter into the star but how much time will pass before this happens are there any circumstances where the black hole would trigger gravitational collapse in the core and result in supernova there seems to be some margin for the accretion heating to counter or exceed the heating from fusion so it could throw the star over the temperature threshold for carbon fusion and above the black hole is converting nearly of the rest mass of the accretion matter to heat while fusion is barely getting about bonus question could this be used to estimate bound on primordial micro black holes with the fraction of low mass stars going supernova

190471 given the lagrangian for system we can construct the hamiltonian using the definition sum limits dot where frac partial partial dot therefore to determine we need to know now suppose we are given the hamiltonian can we then reconstruct the lagrangian certainly the relation sum limits dot is not helpful because there is no prescription how to determine without knowing
190558 earth moves around the sun and the sun moves around the galaxy and the galaxy moves with unknown speed and direction we have speed so the mass of us all altered can we know the real rest mass if so can we deduce our speed in the universe
190591 when two components are combined in an electric circuit there is apart from their own resistances contact resistance at their junction this causes sudden voltage drop of drop contact another thing is thermal resistance which is simply measure of materials resistance against heat flow contact resistance in this field is also present as the temperature drops bit extra at the interfaces total resistance in both electric and thermal series combination is contact let us in both the electric and the thermal case assume direct contact of the two conductors clamped together not soldered or alike resistance within material is for an ideal simple model intuitively clear electrons particles etc bumb into lattice ions and exchange energy my question what is an intuitive explanation of the sudden loss because of contact resistance how is contact resistance explained
190983 https www youtube com watchv ifv9fkbhk 10m55s and it ends at minutes have great love for feynmans explanations but right now seem to have failed to understand exactly how his example proved charge is conserved locally the important quotes would be just before and just after the example is shown the total amount of charge in box might stay the same in two ways it may be that the charge moves from one place to another within the box but another possibility is that the charge in one place disappears and simultaneously charge arises in another place instantaneously related and in such manner that the total charge is never changing this second possibility for the conservation is of different kind from the first in which if charge disappears in one place and turns up in another something has to travel through the space inbetween the second form of charge conservation is called local charge conservation and is far more detailed than the simple remark the total charge does not change would now like to describe to you an argument fundamentally due to einstein which indicates that if anything is conserved it must be conserved locally if we are unable by any experiment to see difference in the physical laws whether we are moving or not then if the conservation of charge were not local only certain kind of man would see it work right namely the guy who is standing still in an absolute sense but such thing is impossible according to einsteins relativity principle and therefore it is impossible to have non local conservation of charge understand the process of the experiment and how each person sees two different situations my confusion is the definition of local conservation and the later mentioned antonym non local conservation directly from his explanation in the first quote it seems that local conservation is defined as if charge pops up somewhere it must have disappeared somewhere else what then does it mean to have non local conservation of charge also dont understand how this example hasnt shown the opposite of what he was trying to demonstrate if charge can pop up in one place at the back of the train and disappear in another at the front local conservation then the person in the top trailer sees situation different than the one in the bottom but this is what violates einsteins relativity principle isnt it the ability to create charge in one place and have it disappear in another is my understanding of local conservation wrong
191013 know that the schwarzschild radius is given by frac 2gm tag however if we had the metric ds artdt frac dr brt 2d sin tag where art neq frac 2gm 2r tag and brt neq frac 2gm tag then what is the event horizon
191042 can the uncertainty principle be derived in quantum field theory if yes does is have different interpretation than quantum mechanics because the coordinates are now parameters and not operators
191062 im working on project and need to measure the diameter of thin bare copper wire but dont know how can you please tell me way to measure the diameter of wire is there way to measure it using diffraction
191425 current nuclear power plants are essentially an enhanced version of kettle which seems like stupidity caused by lack of other options we heat the water which turns to steam which rotates the turbine which is total waste of energy due to the several conversions googled bit and found that actually there exists the thermoelectric effect which allows for converting heat to electricity directly yes didnt know about it until today is it possible to turn the heat from the nuclear reactor directly to electricity have there been any attempts to do it am not asking why we do not use it currently my question is about whether its possible in principle and whether anyone has tried it
191451 want to know the theoretical implication if photons have non zero mass what happens to the maxwell equations what happens to qft if the photon have mass it can decade
191777 underground atomic bomb tests are done in deep sealed hole not all underground tests eject material on the surface in this case they are only noticeable as earthquakes according to german wikipedia on nuclear tests there seems to be no bulge above the explosion site afterwards assume the explosion creates cavity also assume that rocks are not very compressible more so for rocks deep under ground without many gas filled pores id like to understand where the volume of the rock goes is it one or more of these rock is compressible and the surrounding rock is just squished little after the explosion the ground is elastic and there is no cavity after the explosion there is bulge on the surface its just too flat to be noticable but has large volume the cavity is so small that the bulge on the surface is so flat that it is not noticeable there are enough pores filled with compressible gas in rocks generally which end up with higher gas pressure after they lost some or most volume with the total lost volume being the same as the cavities volume regarding compressibility geologic materials reduces in volume only when the void spaces are reduced which expel the liquid or gas from the voids wikipedia compressibility earth science the answer of ldc3 hints that it can be assumed that the ground choosen for nuclear tests is most probably not porous to avoid migration of radioactive isotopes from this it could be concluded that compressibility is not an important factor which is certainly counterintuitive there are probably some more options and it may be more than one mechanism but where does that volume mainly come from
191786 at the 109th ucla faculty research lecture seth putterman gave talk on sonoluminescence during the lecture he emphasized that the navier stokes equations cannot be derived from first principles of physics in physics there are lots of first principles and so the first question is what set of first principles would one expect to derive the navier stokes equations and the second and main question is why does derivation fail are we missing some yet to be discovered set of first principles in this area of physics
191942 according to maxwells equations magnetic fields are divergence free nabla cdot mathbf if understand this correctly this means that magnetic field lines do not start or end how can we reconcile this with magnetic reconnection
192125 from my understanding gamma matrices transforms under lorentz transformation lambda as begin equation gamma mu rightarrow lambda gamma mu lambda lambda mu nu gamma nu end equation where lambda is the corresponding lorentz transformation in bispinor representation so my question is when we change from on frame to another are we allowed to write gamma mu lambda mu nu gamma nu where gamma mu is the transformed version of gamma mu if yes then when we write down gamma mu explicitly in some representation as we do in any standard qft textbook like begin equation gamma mu begin pmatrix sigma mu bar sigma mu end pmatrix end equation do we assume any specific frame of reference if so which frame because if apply lorentz transformation such as boost along direction will have begin equation gamma cosh eta gamma sinh eta gamma begin pmatrix cosh eta sigma sinh eta cosh eta sigma sinh eta end pmatrix end equation and similarly for gamma understand that at the end any choice of reference frame does not matter because thats the point of relativistic theory like qft the term like bar psi gamma mu partial mu psi in the theory will remain invariance under lorentz transformation but just like how we have the momentum shell condition mu mu in all frames but mu itself will change from one frame to the other and in particle rest frame we have mu m000 it seems to me that by writing down gamma mu explicitly as above we are picking specific frame could someone please clarify this to me
192185 so was watching final destination and something caught my attention theres part where bridge collapses and everything falls apart so theres this bus that has person inside unaware of what was happening and it falls vertically the front of the bus is now pointing down and the back points to the sky as the bus is falling the person is shown slipping through the seats and finally ending up on the front window at the front of the bus my question is would that actually happen if someone was falling inside vehicle or should they be pushed to the back or should both fall equally heres the clip of the movie http youtu be m01icyfdlsat 1m7s
192318 am just and curious to learn about theory of relativity can any one explain it simple enough for me to understand read that it is bending of time space or space time that causes gravity how can bending of time takes place
192527 in an electromagnetic theory class my professor introduced the concept of action at distance in physics he said that if two charges are at some very large distance and if any one of the charge moves then the force associated with the charges changes instantaneously but according to einstein no information can travel faster than the speed of light so photons the information carriers in electromagnetic force cannot instantaneously deliver information so that we associate field with the two charges and if any charge moves there is deformation in that field and this deformation travels with the speed of light and conveys the information if the field deformation information cannot travel more than the speed of light how does the force instantaneously change at very large distances
192561 as this answer points out any human would first freeze rather than experience the heat death however assuming hypothetically that we could make some robot live at such low temperature or even considering theoretical observer whose perception rate depends on the speed of processes taking place inside its body how the heat death would look like from its perspective for example if we could say that movie characters perceive things playing using half speed is slow for us but from their perspective everything behaves normally we could pause the movie and then make it play again and they wouldnt even notice is the heat death in any way similar or perhaps no such robot is possible because its components would dissolve first hence no in way conscious process is able to observe their own heat death was trying searching here and elsewhere but nothing came up its possible that ive used wrong search terms in which case would appreciate someone pointing me to the correct ones edit for clarification im interested most in what is observed as heat death happens for example just an varepsilon before it after the heat death happens as the name suggest the universe has died so no robot can do anything to use the movie example suppose that we were to put speedometer displays the current playing speed inside the movie world which could be read by the characters then if we were to play movie slower and slower until stop after the movie is paused the characters cannot move or do anything in particular they cannot see the reading of the speedometer similarly the robot cannot do anything interesting after the heat death on the other hand just before the stop their world would not be different from their perspective only that the speedometer would read close to zero
192713 why not four or five or even more intuitively the more leaves the more power so what is the reason
192891 ive often heard that einstein shattered the notion of absolute motion all things move relative to one another and that he established the speed of light as being absolute that sounds paradoxical to me cannot understand how the two concepts can be reconciled before going further id like to say over the years ive seen many laymans explanations on these topics including the nice youtube video by vsauce would headlights work at light speed understand everything thats said or at least think do just nothing ive found seems to address this apparent contradiction more recently ive tried to find the answer on my own that includes searching the posts on this site some come close like this one but nothing ive been able to find seems address specifically what im asking back to the question relativity shows us that there is no universal frame of reference by which to judge motion so object might be reckoned as moving at relative to object or as stationary relative to object this is fine for me can grasp that the universe has no intrinsic coordinate system that we only think that way on earth because we have the ground to move over then theres the speed of light in vacuum the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit its often said but if there is no universal frame of reference how can there be any such speed the very idea only make sense if there is universal frame if one object is moving uniformly at and another object is also moving at but in the exact opposite direct then from the perspective of either one if they could still see each other the other would appear to violate that speed limit all these spacetime bending consequences used to explain why nothing can move past this speed only seems to enshrine the concept that there is some ultimate speed standard if there is only relative speed then the concept of light having specific speed in the vacuum should be nonsensical one since it having speed would only make sense when measured against some other body since was very young it has always sounded to me like motion is only mostly relative that until you get close to the speed of light the effects of an absolute frame of reference are negligible perhaps that there is an actual fabric of space which everything moves relative to which is why there is something to expand between galaxies faster than light can propagate in the metric expansion of space growing up always thought this would just start makes sense with time now im up to first year college level in physics even know basic calculus yet im still hopelessly confused edit thank you to whoever suggested this may be duplicate of what is the speed of light relative to it and others are very much related and at least partially answer my question unfortunately explaining that distances become shorter and time becomes slower as way to stop you from exceeding the speed of light does not explain how that speed is not an absolute by my reckoning if all speed is relative then no matter how fast you go light should always race away from you at the same apparent speed there should be no speed limit for there to be speed which you cannot exceed or you would catch up and make time irrelevant requires the very concept of some external speed by which light can travel and nothing else can reach thus my logical paradox continues unabated
193188 was thinking about this recently and think this is reasonable question to ask sr can handle forces just like newtonian physics can the difference is that the four force is defined bit differently than the classical force so this made me wonder whats the difference between that body is experiencing force of lets say newtons due to electrostatic forces and that the same body is experiencing the same force due to gravity cant we just treat the force due to gravity like any other four force in sr when it comes to gravity why does the origin of the force matter force is still force so what exactly does sr fail at cant we just treat gravity as four force acting on body like any other force in sr
193205 the original question was to prove sigma phi sigma sigma phi 2i sigma phi sigma since left hand side is equal to sigma thought in order for right hand side to be equal to sigma have to show that 2i sigma phi for thisi tried to expand 2i sigma phi cos2 sigma phi sin2 sigma phi and use cos2 sigma phi frac sigma phi frac sigma phi sin2 sigma phi sigma phi frac sigma phi frac sigma phi where sigma is pauli matrix component have tried to expand the exponential in the similar way as above but could not verify the above result dont know whether my question is wrong or there are any other methods to solve this problem
193237 in an alternative to compactification by randall and sundrum they discuss the localization of graviton modes around the planck brane in the randall sundrum model where we have compact fifth interval like dimension an mathbb orbifold to be precise at whose two ends two branes the planck and the tev brane sit taking linearized metric perturbation mn eta mn mn and expanding mu nu sum mu nu psi where mu are the 4d coordinates and is the fifth compact dimension schr dinger like equation is derived for the modes psi using the form from gabellas notes left partial frac frac lvert rvert frac 3k deltay deltay lvert rvert right psi psi this is solved for the psi and it is claimed that the psi are wavefunctions showing by inspection of the solution that gravitons are localized around the planck brane indicating the weakness of gravity at the tev brane the question is why would the psi be the wavefunctions of gravitons either we are in classical theory and we have shown localization of classical metric perturbations around the planck brane or we are in quantum field theory and the psi should be operator valued rather than wavefunctions and should only obey the classical equation of motion as an operator equation in the latter case it is not obvious to me that localization of the solution of the classical equation of motion should imply localization of the quantum states belonging to the field
193364 tried searches and the question has been posed in other fora but no experiment came up track chambers cloud chambers bubble chambers time projection chambers solid state detectors like the vertex detectors at lhc give the track of the particle as it ionizes the medium and could be carried out in geometry after the particle has passed the double slit the straight track should be pointing back to the slit it came from and its record could be used as the points on the screen in the classical double slit experiment the set up as see it would be the classical setup for single electron through the double slits but instead of screen one has detector and detects the track it should be long enough detector to get an accuracy less than the slit difference so it could point back to the slit as the interslit distance is of the order of microns and detectors are giving order of microns accuracies this experiment if possible would resolve the controversy whether the detection of the slit destroys the interference pattern or the detection elements at the slits change the boundary conditions and destroy the interference pattern an experts opinion is necessary whether the experiment is possible whether the energies of the electrons to show interference with specific separation is enough to create an accurate track in solid state detector if not cloud chamber would do but again the energy of the electron would be important because it would have to pass the barrier air chamber it could succeed if the double slits were within cloud bubble chamber the beam count was low to twelve per picture but it was spread in the vertical direction if the beam could be focused on the slits it should be doable
193585 why is the surface of the moon white rather what makes the surface white
193609 read in various places that frequency does not change with medium instead wavelength changes in different mediums due to change in speed understand why speed changes with medium but im not sure why wavelength not frequency changes one website said it was because of conservation of energy but read that the energy of sound wave depends on its amplitude not frequency is that correct if so why does frequency not depend on the medium
193663 am extremely interested in self learning einsteins theory of relativity but dont know where to start can make general relativity my starting point and later look at special relativity as special case of gr is is doable for person with average math skills
193684 so my friend asked me why angles are dimensionless to which replied that its because they can be expressed as the ratio of two quantities lengths ok so far so good then came the question in that sense even length is ratio of length of given thing by length of metre so are lengths dimensionless this confused me bit didnt really have good answer to give to that his argument certainly seems to be valid although im pretty sure im missing something crucial here
193864 do external forces can affect the light can any external force make the light accelerate and if it can will it accumulate mass according to the second newtons law of motion we know that frac 0c sqrt frac mc frac sqrt frac rest mass as you can see as the velocity of body is higher the less mass it has when we exert tremendous force on an object will its mass will change along with the time according to the last equation as slower the body the more mass it has if we could make the light slower will it accumulate mass
193918 am most interested in interpretational differences due to the fact that quantum field theory is relativistic while quantum mechanics is not by copenhagen interpretation mean minimal interpretation that connects mathematical formalism to observations the answer to collapse in quantum field theory says the collapse of wavefunction or its decoherence or splitting off into different branches as it gets entangled with measurement apparatus looks exactly the same but this is odd quantum mechanics has global time variable so it makes sense to talk about quantum state at time being superposition and then being collapsed eigenstate at later time of course it turns out that although qm is non relativistic and collapse is formally instantaneous where physical entities are concerned it happens to be compatible with relativity by happy coincidence but in relativistic qft such description does not work even formally there is no global time or absolute simultaneity so no quantum state at time that can be described as collapsing one could try to relativize this to particular observer but such relative collapses are incoherent because different observers have different simultaneity surfaces so in qft instantaneous collapse would not just be formally non relativistic but meaningless like syntax error so how is the collapse whether actual or apparent interpreted in qft in way consistent with special relativity edit after searching found reality measurement and locality in quantum field theory helpful it analyzes the epr experiment from the qft point of view and discusses collapse explicitly on interpretational issues of qft more broadly against field interpretations of quantum field theory gives nice overview
193954 if black holes have mass but no size does that imply zero uncertainty in position if so what does that imply for uncertainty in momentum
194257 when jupiter formed assume like the other planets it started as tiny clumps of matter that eventually came together became gravitationally bound and then eventually captured lot of gas ive also heard it was capable of collecting lot of solid ice due to its distance from the sun anyway if jupiter were larger we might be living in binary star system so my question then becomes did the sun have similar beginning to jupiter and in what way was it different did the sun form around solid core
194275 is it possible to walk in frictionless world think you wont be able to walk because walking depends on friction acting on your feet think about it like an ice rink because when you try to walk on an ice rink it is incredibly hard as there is less friction acting on your feet can it be shown mathematically using principles of mechanics that it is not possible to walk in frictionless world or is it only by experiment edit do not mean outer space by frictionless world because you are not being pushed on surface by gravity am looking for mechanism that would allow biological specimen to walk on surface without friction assuming that all other laws and effects are in place edit what mean by walking is that you must move your legs in order to walk read the idea about using cleat like shoes to walk the cleats would make holes into the ground allowing something to push off of horizontally allowing you to walk but how would that even work if the world is frictionless making holes in the ground would just turn the material you are standing on into rubble the rubble would then act like the original material that you wanted to put holes into in the first place how does material stay together in frictionless world
194280 for photons their waves are oscillating electromagnetic fields from what ive heard electrons are also some kind of wave so what field is exactly oscillating for electrons which makes them wave it cant be the electromagnetic field think sorry if the question is stupid
194334 ive been told that physicists and computer scientists are working on computers that could use quantum physics to increase significantly computation capabilities and break any cipher so cryptography becomes meaningless is it true
194367 what is the size scale of wood fire that is producing 1kw id like to improve my ability to conceptualize various power scales
194661 we know that the theory of cosmic censorship prevent singularities from existing without an event horizon that hides them from the universe now lets assume that this theory is somehow false and naked singularity appears in the solar system how would we notice it for the first time what would it look like how would it behave and could we use it for someting useful
194733 have followed derivations of the navier stokes equations and can see how the various terms arise in the main equation the momentum conservation equation however dont understand why the mass conservation equation has no diffusion term there is diffusion type term in the conservation of momentum equation so why do we not have one in the conservation of mass equation
194936 the law of thermodynamics says that two bodies will eventually have equal temperatures how is it possible that when you leave your car in the sun it gets hotter in the car than it is outside why isn the car at the same temperature as the outside as it should be according to the law
194986 am trying to learn how to calculate scattering amplitudes in klein gordon theory am getting stuck with the simplest of the examples phi to phi in free scalar field theory if calculate the amplitude for the process phi to phi get two different results depending on whether use feynman rules or the lsz formula lets say that the incoming particle has momentum mathrm in and that the outgoing one has momentum mathrm out then simple feynman diagram gives amplitude propagator that is mathrm in stackrel blacktriangleright mathrm out qquad qquad frac tag where is the momentum of virtual particle connecting the in and out states from momentum conservation mathrm in mathrm out from we get that the amplitude for phi to phi is mathcal frac mathrm in frac mathrm out if on the other hand we calculate the amplitude for the process with the lsz reduction formula we get mathcal a2 pi deltap mathrm in mathrm out int mathrm dx mathrm dy ip mathrm in ip mathrm out square square langle phix phiy rangle where square equiv partial and langle phix phiy rangle is the propagator as the kg derivative when acting on the propagator results in delta square langle phix phiy rangle deltax this integral evaluates to begin align mathcal pi deltap mathrm in mathrm out int mathrm dx mathrm dy ip mathrm in ip mathrm out square deltax pi deltap mathrm in mathrm out mathrm in end align tag from we get mathcal mathrm in mathrm out comparing this to the amplitude from the diagram we find that the results disagree can anybody tell me where is my mistake believe that the right result is the first one so maybe my formula for lsz is wrong or cannot be used in one particle process
195297 the escape velocity of different planets and stars vary if they vary the velocities of bodies escaping from the respective stars or planets should also vary like if want ball to reach meter height should throw with different velocities on earth compared to some other planet as light say photon crosses many stars and planets doesnt its speed vary compared to another photon
195648 assume it could withstand extreme temperatures in either direction im mainly curious what would happen to its circuits as it approached the speed of light
195842 the maxwells equation boldsymbol nabla cdot textbf textbf frac rho textbf epsilon is derived from the gauss law in electrostatics which is in turn derived from coulombs law therefore textbf must be an electrostatic field time independent then how is this equation valid for the electric field textbf textbf which is time dependent for example the electric field of an electromagnetic wave can we prove that boldsymbol nabla cdot textbf textbf frac rho textbf epsilon edit have changed boldsymbol nabla cdot textbf to boldsymbol nabla cdot textbf frac rho epsilon in the question
195915 based on popular accounts of modern physics and black holes articles video lectures have come to understand the following black holes are predicted by general relativity classical theory of gravity we know that the universe is inherently quantum mechanical so we believe general relativity to be somehow incomplete or inaccurate we do not have quantum mechanical theory of gravity we know that on some level general relativity and quantum mechanics are incompatible there is no direct experimental evidence of event horizons if all of these things are true and if they arent please correct me why do we trust black hole physics how can we talk about something like hawking radiation if it uses both general relativity and quantum mechanics and we know that we dont know exactly how to unify them when read about or hear physicists talk about black hole related phenomena they speak with some considerable degree of certainty that these things actually exist and that they behave in the way the known physical laws describe them so id like to understand why in the absence of direct evidence or unified quantum mechanics general relativity framework we can be so confident in black hole physics edit just want to point out in response to some of the answers that am aware of the evidence of very massive objects which are very compact and are believed to be black holes do not doubt that there exist very massive objects which have great effect on the propagation of light and distort space and so on when talk about black hole physics specifically mean physics which is derived by combining quantum mechanics and gr such as hawking radiation things relating to the information paradox etc thats also why specifically mentioned event horizons
195951 neutrons which constitute neutron star have rest mass that is greater when separated from the star because they are bound with certain potential energy this potential energy causes the system to have less mass so my question is how much less is it significant do we measure it
196006 for while now ive noticed that if take cup of hot tea and pour it into two cups and leave it then both cups will cool faster than the single cup how is it that nature cools two cups of tea in parallel more quickly its still the same amount of tea but it gets cooled quicker if have two cups
196100 we have images of stars orbiting black holes or black holes destroying near stars but why do we see the stars moving normally mean if time dilation does exist shouldnt we see that stars slow down and speed up why do we see stars orbiting at normal rate
196127 imagine there are two rooms kept at the same temperature but with different humidity levels person is asked to stay in each room for minutes at the end of experiment if we ask them which room was hotter they will point to the room with the higher humidity correct right how does humidity cause this feeling of hotness
196136 note for the purposes of my question when refer to free fall assume it takes place in vacuum from my admittedly weak understanding of the equivalence principle falling in gravitational field is physically indistinguishable from floating in interstellar space this would make sense to me if gravity simply caused an object to move at constant velocity moving at constant speed or floating in space are just two different ways of describing an inertial frame and are fundamentally no different but free falling in gravitational field means accelerating continuously and doesnt an accelerating body experience force then isnt free falling fundamentally different from floating in space
196153 the usual maxwell equations are for spatial dimensions right is it possible to generalize them to spatial dimensions or spatial dimensions
196383 ive written simple non scientific body simulation for fun http magwo github io fullofstars expected to create something looking like spinning galaxies there are two invisible very heavy objects in that simulation however as learned for it to resemble galaxies there needs to be something more than just body simulation http en wikipedia org wiki galaxy rotation curve so my question is this for my simulation to look like spinning galaxies how should the dark matter be positioned moving and how should it interact with the visible particles should the dark matter be at all affected by the gravity of the visible particles or should it be one way interaction what makes the dark matter stay in place to preserve its compressing effect on the particle cloud is the gravity interaction from the dark matter an attraction force just like normal gravity or is it repelling force
196564 this evening my six year old asked me would piece of paper look as big as this room to an atom or bigger this room being small sized bedroom friend suggested it would probably look as big as the state of connecticut then figured well really the question is not defined enough because really piece of paper would look as big as piece of paper let us instead ask if you blew up an atom to the size of human and you expanded piece of paper by the same amount how big would the piece of paper be found someones estimate of the number of molecules in piece of paper times text molecules text sheet of paper guess all need do now is multiply an sheet of paper by that number only think is dont have clue how to work with that number
196726 ive been reading about how the conical shape of train wheels helps trains round turns without differential for those who are unfamiliar with the idea the conical shape allows the wheels to shift and slide across the tracks thus effectively varying their radii and allowing them to cover different distances while rotating at the same angular velocity cross sectional view of the tracks and wheels generally looks something like but what about configuration like the following read in an online article that wheels in the second configuration may more easily slip and derail from the tracks assuming there are no flanges to prevent them from doing so but cant convince myself using physics why that might be is one of these two configurations actually more reliable than the other
196848 lets denote by psit rangle some wavefunction at time then lets define the time evolution operator ut 1t through ut 2t psit rangle psit rangle tag and hamiltonian through psit rangle frac partial partial psit rangle tag we have set hbar question what is the relation between and given that doesnt depend explicitly on attempts it is well known that the answer is ut 2t cdot it 1h for some scalar some sources postulate it follows from operator equation hu frac partial partial but we cannot integrate it like we could an ordinary differential equation fxgx frac partial partial gx at least dont know how to integrate operators then we could also guess the solution ut 2t cdot it 1h and verify by inserting into but then we still need to show that this is the general solution it 1h spans the set of all solutions also this approach doesnt enlighten as to why we chose that particular guess
197110 if two stars of any type were to form near each other how closely can they form before something prevents them from being two distinct stars
197292 im currently studying action ive been reading about how particle has particular probabilities of ending at an infinite number of events say have free particle that isnt experiencing any external forces no potential or friction give it particular kinetic energy whilst it is at some arbitrary event why doesnt the particle stay at position lose its kinetic energy and reduce the action to minimum why does it travel in particular straight line you cant argue from conservation laws since they are dependent on the idea of the stationary action principle im curious to know the answer cheers
197487 like many others have marveled at the images made available from the hubble space telescope over the years but have always had curiosity about the color shown in these images an example is shown below are the colors we see such as the yellows blues and so on the true colors or are they applied by some kind of colorization method to enhance the image quality for realism
197595 can somebody explain to me how much mass neutrinos have according to my understanding neutrinos oscillate therefore they should have some mass if this is right then how much mass do they have
197713 if two photons were to collide directly head on and are of the same energy what happens are new particles created is energy released or do they just pass through one another
197848 why is the reynolds number the way it is why is its order the way it is im not sure if this is an appropriate question for this context but would like more intuition on this matter and so im using naive approach what goes on in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow
197973 is every electron in the universe in different quantum state is this what the pauli exclusion principle tells us
199352 this goes for every problem either in electromagnetism or fluid dynamics that has to do with vector fields say we have fluid flowing in closed circular pipe or an electromagnetic field the concept does not matter if its mixed second partial derivatives are not equivalent frac partial mathbf partial partial neq frac partial mathbf partial partial where mathbf is the flow velocity vector then what does this mean physical not mathematical meaning want an intuitivephysicalnot plain mathematics understanding of what changes for the fluid or em field from the situation in which they where equal give your own example if you think that this is the ideal way of explaining the stuff you have in mind note for those who dont know elementary mathematics tell us that those second mixed partial derivatives should be equal in most cases so my question has to do with an exception of this rule especially in physics where we dont see this kind of behavior everyday
199606 referring to this article where we see there are three flavors of neutrinos got me thinking of simple binary based communication but more like the udp protocol where we can live with dropped packets the dropped packets in this case would be when the neutrino changes types or flavors or not detected im not sure if the loss or change would be within an acceptable range but it got me thinking if they can detect transmitted neutrino hundreds of miles away without an actual conduit cables wires em tunnel could communication system not be derived out of this it is understood that with todays technology detectors are large expensive and only detect some of the neutrinos but in theory is this not possible and if so how
199632 in the case of supernova explosion it is possible to create heavy elements through fusion supernovae have tremendous amount of energy in very small volume but not as much energy per volume as there was in our early universe so what is the major difference why didnt the big bang create heavy elements
199995 have tried to compute lights lateral shift after passing through glass slab in terms of the incidence angle theta the slab thickness and the refraction index have found that the lateral shift is given by frac sin theta left sqrt sin theta right left sqrt sin theta cos theta right in order to test this formula have considered two extreme cases when the light is perpendicular to the slab theta and when it is almost parallel theta approx pi the first case works ok since if theta then sin theta and this is physically plausible for if the light ray is perpendicular then it does not change direction im having trouble assessing the second case if theta approx pi then the formula can be written as frac sqrt is this physically plausible my guess has been that if can say that gg obtain approx this sounds correct to me since if the light ray approaches the slab almost parallel then after refracting back to air it should come out almost parallel causing lateral shift of exactly am not sure however in saying gg have checked glasss refraction index and it lies in the range am correct
200078 how do lenses produce dimensional images if lens bends all incoming rays of light to intersect at the focal point shouldnt this produce single dot of light on screen placed at the focal length this is basically the standard diagram that always shows up in textbooks know this doesnt happen in real life used to use telescopes pretty frequently for work the most in focus image would be the one with the smallest diameters for the stars which of course we think of point sources at infinity but the light from all stars despite being at infinity is not all focused at single point instead each stars light is focused at its own xy point on 2d image cant reconcile the theory as understand it with any of my real life experience with optics what am missing

200173 the question stated by what percentage does your rest mass increase when you climb 30m to the top of ten story building new to the concept of relativistic energy was bit confused with figuring out how to approach this question the relativistic energy of particle its normal total energy but incorporating relativity effects due to its high speeds is equal to mc frac mc sqrt frac gamma since the equation is only the sum of the particles kinetic energy and rest mass am uncertain in how to find the rest mass increase knowing only the change in height potential energy increase since am not moving at relativistic speeds can just use the normal conservation of energy formula initial final assuming started at height 0m and all energy was conserved while climbing frac mgh which when simplified and rearranged for speed equals to sqrt 2gh the formula for relativistic mass is rel frac rest sqrt frac since the question asked me by what percentage does your rest mass increase am assuming have to find frac rel rest times rearranging the formula for relativistic mass and substituting in the equation for speed from above frac rel rest frac sqrt frac 2gh however this gives me an answer of which is clearly incorrect the answer stated in the text is times have checked over my work but dont know whether have made an error in my reasoning or my calculations all help is greatly appreciated
200198 please forgive my lack of artistic ability but heres my question consider that skydiver without using his parachute were to fall exactly parallel to giant curved slide that starts at circ perpendicular to the ground and gradually curves until it is parallel to the ground can he survive my thinking tells me that if stood at the top of the slide and slid down making sure to keep contact with the slide would if the top of the slide was high enough eventually get to almost terminal velocity yet when the slide starts to curve would begin to feel an increase in force and friction but no impact and thus would survive so then if were to jump directly above the slide given that had enough time to adjust myself to be perfectly aligned with the slide as it started to shallow or even better if was able to have my body or part of my body scraping the slide the impact when the slide moves from degrees to degrees would be soft enough for me to survive and so forth until im actually sliding and no longer falling with the slide

200752 know that fire is chemical reaction and for that reason it has no mass but im not sure that this fact is enough to conclude that it has no effect on the weight of burning object consider the case of balloon obviously in this case fire has an effect because of the well know fact that balloon achieves buoyancy by heating the air inside but really want to know if it has an effect on burning building for instance does it weigh more or less
200868 read somewhere that most things1 emits all kinds of radiation just very few of some kinds so that made me wondering whether there is formula to calculate how many rays an 100w incandescent light bulb would emit for example in photons per second for example we already know that it emits infrared and visible light find it hard to describe what have tried searched on the internet for formula but couldnt find it yet thought this was an interesting question so posted it here black holes dont emit any radiation excepted for hawking radiation if get it right
200932 why are golden mirrors yellow do they add yellow component to the spectrum or absorb non yellow components if they absorb then why are they used in telescopes being imperfect if they add yellow component then where do they take energy for it from jwst mirrors are coated with gold do they add some corrections in the on board computer to compensate for the color of gold

201393 the existence of band structure of crystalline solid comes from the bloch theorem which relies on the independent electron approximation why do people still talk about the band structure for strongly correlated system superconductors and topological insulators in such strongly correlated systems shouldnt the independent electron approximation becomes entirely invalid rendering the band structure of solid meaningless thanks for the help
201482 in literature usually two types of definition exist for greens function hat deltax this equation states that greens function is solution to an ode assuming the source is delta function langle psix 1t psi daggerx 2t rangle this definition states that greens function is something like propagator want to know the internal relationship between the two definitions
201492 refer the classical theory of fields by landau lifshitz chap consider disk of radius then circumference is pi now make this disk rotate at velocity of the order of cspeed of light since velocity is perpendicular to radius vector radius does not change according to the observer at rest but the length vector at boundary of disk parallel to velocity vector will experience length contraction thus dfrac text radius text circumference dfrac pi when disc is rotating but this violates rules of euclidean geometry what is wrong here
201786 the casimir operator textbf commutates with the elements of the angular momentum operator textbf textbf however the do not commute among themselves hbar epsilon ijk this makes sense so far but it leaves me wondering how their eigenspaces relate to each other remember some theorem that diagonalizable commuting matrices share their eigenspaces if those operators could be expressed as complex matrices in the finite dimensional case they surely are diagonalizable so it follows that textbf has the same eigenspaces as the three but that would imply that they commute among themselves which is not the case what am missing what is the relation between the eigenspaces of these operators
201835 the higgs field as understand it reading laymans articles permeated the entire universe only fraction of second after the big bang are there any other fields that they know about or theorize about am wrong in thinking based on some light reading that field that permeates the entire universe as opposed to localized field that can be property of gravitational attraction or electromagnetism is property of the space itself or property of vacuum energy might be another way to put it apologies if this is too vague it sounds kinda vague as write it in nutshell the question is is the higgs field unique or are there other fields that can be compared to it
201877 having defined the expectation value of position as follows langle rangle int lvert psixt rvert 2dx the time derivative of the expectation value is derived in my literature in the following way frac langle rangle dt int partial lvert psi rvert 2dx ldots from here it is straightforward algebra and calculus to the answer frac langle rangle dt frac hbar 2m int overline psi partial psi dx what strikes me as odd is the fact that the author didnt write frac langle rangle dt int partial leftx lvert psi rvert 2dx right somehow the position is treated as constant there is no explanation to why this is the case from above is somehow unchanging in time and the only thing that alters the expectation value is the wave function this might be the case but then what is the interpretation of why doesnt vary in time

202823 in this video an airport worker in blue tries to prevent boeing from sliding on ice in heavy winds did he even have chance on one side of the argument the airplane is sliding due to the force of the wind being stronger than the force of friction against the ice if the worker can counter that force to prevent it from rising above the static coefficient of friction with the ice then he could prevent the plane from sliding further even if the wind could apply newton of force over the static coefficient of friction of the tires the plane would slide the worker should be able to apply few tens of newtons to counteract that force of that magnitude on the other hand how much force could he reasonably apply certainly no more than his own static friction with the ice would allow maybe the fact that he could dig heels into the ice would make his contribution significant of course dont expect the worker to stop the sliding plane but could he reasonably have prevented the plane from sliding further
203003 have rm gas molecules in sealed electrically insulated container what equation can use to accurately calculate the pressure of the gas it seems to me that pv nrt will not apply to this scenario as the electrical forces between the molecules are significant especially as the density of the gas increases additional thoughts it is complicated problem because there are lot of interactions between energies and forces lots of questions that need to be considered for example is the pressure at every point in the container the same or does the shape of the container affect the pressure as the molecules attempt to be distant from each other does the repulsive force of the gas cause the molecules to stay more or less stationary how much energy is stored in the electric fields between the molecules why this is interesting am trying to determine how effective this device would be as capacitor battery how does this device compare to li ion batteries in storage capacity could this be practically used as piezoelectric or linear actuator see http imgur com yb5fz2x http imgur com uzbjjkb any insight would be appreciated
203067 photon could spontaneously split up into two or more versions of itself and all the conservation laws im aware of would not be violated by this process think ive given this some thought and system consisting of multiple lower energy photons would have significantly higher number of micro states and consequentially higher entropy than one consisting of single photon with that much energy this would make the process more favorable why does this not happen
203493 few months ago was telling high school students about fermats principle you can use it to show that light reflects off surface at equal angles to set it up you put in boundary conditions like the light starts at and ends at but these conditions by themselves are insufficient to determine what the path is because theres an extra irrelevant stationary time path which is the light going directly from to without ever bouncing off the surface we get rid of this by adding in another boundary condition that we only care about paths that actually do bounce then the solution is unique of course the second finished saying this one of the students asked what if youre inside an elliptical mirror and and are the two foci in this case you can impose the condition we only care about paths that hit the mirror but this doesnt nail down the path at all because any path that consists of straight line from to the mirror followed by straight line to will take equal time so in this case the principle tells us nothing at all the fact that we can get no information whatsoever from an action principle feels disturbing thought the standard model was based on one of those my questions are is this anything more than mathematical curiosity does this come up as problem obstacle in higher physics is there nicer mathematically natural way to state the only count bouncing paths condition also is there nice condition that specifies path in the ellipse case what should have told that student
203697 in many places in statistical physics we use the partition function to me the explanations of their use are clear but wonder what their physical significance is can anyone please explain with good example without too many mathematical complications
203746 if we pick reference frame where for example our planet is standing still although it should be irrelevant what would the speed distribution of all objects in the universe look like for the sake of simplification we can limit ourselves to macroscopic objects planets stars black holes etc and not consider particles especially those rotating with great speeds which mess with the distribution or nebulae the first idea that popped in mind was the maxwell boltzmann distribution similar to gas particles but it doesnt account for gravity which is analogous to intermolecular forces in the kinetic theory of gasses and all the motion resulting from it among other things so its out of the game moreover does it even make sense to talk about speed distribution in our universe which is expanding note found similar question on pse where the author initially asked similar thing but finally resorted to answering different problem so the question is still open edit since its likely that the expansion of the universe makes the problem much more complicated and in fact makes the speed distribution innormalizable we may give further constraint in terms of locality of the solution limit ourselves to observing motion only within our own galaxy
204029 this question addresses the scope of general relativity scientists and engineers solve all sorts of physical problems in all sorts of fields and often to solve these problems system is defined including inputs outputs inter relationships of variables and constraints and from this definition the equations of motion are written specific to that system so my question is can the einstein field equations efe of general relativity lead to the same equations of motion for these specific systems in all cases discounting for the moment quantum mechanical systems in other words are the efe of general relativity the mother of all equations of motion in the universe outside of quantum mechanical systems and therefore more generalized way of writing equations of motion for all systems if this is true then from the field equations can one derive maxwells equations
204090 it is usually said that the points on the surface of the bloch sphere represent the pure states of single level quantum system pure state being of the form psi rangle rangle rangle and typically the north and south poles of this sphere correspond to the rangle and rangle states image bloch sphere by glosser ca own work licensed under cc by sa via commons https commons wikimedia org wiki file bloch sphere svg media file bloch sphere svg but isnt this very confusing if the north and south poles are chosen then both states are on the same line and not orthogonal anymore so how can one choose an arbitrary point on the surface of the sphere and possibly decompose it in terms of states in order to find and does this mean that one shouldnt regard the bloch sphere as valid basis for our system and that its just visualization aid have seen decompositions in terms of the internal angles of the sphere in the form of cos theta and phi sin theta with theta the polar angle and phi the azimuthal angle but am clueless as to how these are obtained when states are on the same line
204094 the state of quantum system is represented by wavefunction usually in some specific hilbert space of position spin momentum etc but before deciding in which of these bases to decompose the wavefunction in what form does the wavefunction have of course not having decomposed it yet it does not yet have component wise definition to clarify with example we write psix rangle langle psi rangle rangle but what form does this mysterious psi have before the basis representation how is the inner product above even allowed if psi is not yet defined in some other basis on related note does the schrodinger equation have other representations other than its position and momentum forms mean can one obtain the spin wavefunction psi of system directly from the schrodinger equation or first psi is obtained and then decomposed in spin basis last question regarding the wavefunction for more than dimension when one writes psixy do and correspond to different hilbert spaces rangle and rangle in which case wed write psixy in rangle otimes rangle does this mean that single particle in dimensions looks very much like particles each in one dimension or one should never mix multidimensionality with multi body systems in qm
204100 have come across wonderful review of entanglement by chris drost in his answer to this post one part that left me puzzled was this post is merely an attempt to understand portion of chris answer unfortunately do not have enough reputation to ask this as comment in his post so figured new post wouldnt be terrible idea as this is rather important conceptual question for all beginners obviously the product states have quantum coherence to both qubits doing our double slit experiment means that we see an interference pattern shockingly entanglement weakens and sometimes eliminates this interference pattern for example the state sqrt frac rangle sqrt frac rangle describes an entangled state if you pass the first qubit of this through the double slit experiment normal rules of quantum mechanics give the distribution frac 0x frac 1x classically overlapping bell curves unfortunately fail to see how by entangling two particles they lose their coherence but when have particle in superposition state psi rangle rangle and entangle it to another system in state psi my first particle still remains in superposition and its measurement is still random is it not so why do we say that entanglement destroys coherence it would be great if one could elaborately show this for the simplest entangled pairs is the point maybe that if is measured first only then loses its coherence assume here complete correlation small digression if may if it is true that entangelemnt destroys coherence does the converse mean that the concept of decoherence is tightly related to entanglement of small system with its environment or in other words would decoherence happen at all without entanglement
205186 heard the standard interpretation of heisenberg uncertainty principle just the measurement affects the position of the body because always you want to see body to measure the position you need light and only the fact that photons that strike the surface of that radiating body have momentum mean that the position of the radiating body isnt certain even theoretically only because of your measuring and therefore the uncertainty in position will always be non zero is there some possible way to modify this model to apply always in quantum mechanics if no is there some good model what describes the origin of the uncertainty
205222 am looking for an answer that does not rely on special or general relativity and without recourse to the fact that the speed of light is frame invariant is there another way of showing this universal speed limit to be necessary one that it would have been possible to find before einstein made his theories for myself think there should be universal speed limit because there is law of diminishing returns when we look for ways to accelerate an object we have to mine further and further regions of the universe which means that even an infinite universe would only have finite amount of accessible energy however following my reasoning it does not follow that this limit would be the same as the speed of light in vacuum dont deny that it is identical just that my method does not show this
205370 we can make objects invisible in the realm of radio and infrared wavelength we can for example hide plane radar and heat signature from being detected however it seem even after years of research very challenging to mask the visible light signature of an object it would be the coolest thing to make stuff invisible to human eyes but we still cant do it yet why is it so hard to do so
205513 my bedford and fowler textbook 4th edition has chapter on numerical solutions im having trouble understanding how the textbook splits up the components of force in the and directions to model the drag on projectile the aerodynamic frag force on the projectile is of magnitude where is constant we must determine the and components of the total force on the projectile let be the drag force because is unit vector in the direction of we can write the drag force as frac the external forces on the projectile are its weight and the drag so we have sum mgj and the total components of the force are sum sqrt quad sum mg sqrt quad dont understand how the individual components of the drag force acting in opposition to the projectiles movement becomes something like this sqrt understand that the absolute value of something can be represented as sqrt and the magnitude of velocity from its and components can be calculated as sqrt but dont get how the non absolute term magically becomes or while the absolute term doesnt become or too what about equations without absolute values in them like the drag force equation frac pv 2ac where pa are constants would the horizontal and vertical components of forces then be frac pv 2ac and mg frac pv 2ac

205553 it is said fact that the speed of light is insurmountable but can the validity of this fact be questioned in another medium if pass beam of light in say water here the light speed is reduced and travel alongside it then my dynamic mass will not become infinite and will be able to notice some effects right so can somebody please explain if this is correct or not and what will be experiencing while travelling at intermediate speedbetween and and the same in an optically denser medium please do consider my ideas of visual boom in analogy to sonic boom also will there be any imposable physical restrictions barring such ftl motion in non vacuum mediumsuch as disintegration at the atomic scale due to high speed collisions or friction holding me back
205555 on wikipedia they say that the evanescent wave has magnitude of alpha beta where sqrt but what direction does this vector point in and why let us say the boundary lies in the zy plane edit am not sure if my original question was clear the electric field is vector and hence can be written as vec alpha beta hat where hat is some unit vector my question is what direction is hat pointing in
205810 the clips that have seen of rockets launching all seem to be carried out during daytime however we learnt at school that rockets are fired closer to the equator and towards the east to take maximum advantage of earths rotational motion getting boost in speed of roughly 460m at the equator if we would go to such lengths to gain boost of speed of 460m why dont we take advantage of the fact that the earth orbits the sun at the massive speed of 30km to get an extra boost in velocity relative to other stellar objects but to take advantage of both the rotational speed of the earth about its own axis and the rotational speed of the earth about the sun the rocket would have to be launched at nighttime as the only times when the boost from the purple rotation was in line with the boost from the red rotation is during the night time it seems that this would greatly reduce the fuel needed to reach distant objects for instance pluto new horizons seems to have launched during the daytime
205881 we have spin state begin align psi rangle rangle rangle end align where rangle and rangle are up and down basis vectors and are their complex coefficients begin align yi end align begin align zi end align are the real parameters im asking about since ua da we can ignore one of these lets say and still calculate the state of the system so now we have three needed parameters now according to my book ignoring the overall phase factor makes it possible to specify the spin state using only two parameters know what the phase factor is and that we can ignore it in the calculations but dont see how it relates to the number of parameters needed how to do it with more basis vectors for example in situation like this this should have parameters but dont know what to do since cant use the sine cosine trick now begin align psi rangle rangle rangle rangle rangle end align

206048 pluto and charon photo taken by new horizons on july from distance of gigameters its hard for me to believe there were no stars behind the twin dwarf planets in the field of vision also would not expect the planets to be illuminated so brightly how many zillion of kilometers are they away from the sun that it washes out the stars is it because of time exposure and movement of the spacecraft but then why is the detail on pluto not smeared away
206440 my question is set in the following situation you have completely empty universe without boundaries in this universe is single gun which holds one bullet the gun fires the bullet and the recoil sends both flying in opposite directions for simplicity ill take the inertial frame of reference of the gun the gun fired the bullet from its center of mass so it does not rotate we now have bullet speeding away from the gun there is no friction the only thing in this universe to exert gravity is the gun and the bullet would given large enough amount of time the bullet fall back to the gun or is there limit to the distance gravity can reach
206579 came across this video of taylor couette flow on youtube originally was looking for visualization of the wavy taylor vortices induced by the angular motion of the inner cylinder however found something strange as you can see at the end of the video the experimenter at the beginning injects three different dyes in viscous liquid and then he begins to stir slowly in specific direction until the three dyes are fully diffused into the main liquid finally he stopped the stirring and began to stir in the opposite direction returning the three dyes to its original spots well sort of so how is this reversibility even possible shouldnt the diffusion of dyes into the liquid be irreversible
206669 often times you pass by an electrical box on an electrical pole and you hear distinct hum emanating from it what causes that tone does the flow of electricity itself have sound or does the flow rattle the metal parts at certain frequency causing the sound
206790 am just trying to understand the fundamental difference between these two concepts in physics from discreteness of some quantity one usually interprets it as quantity being only able to take on distinct set of values and not all the possible values as would be possible for quantity with continuous spectrum the position on the other hand all computational problems in physics numerical ones are performed via discretization process where the continuous spectrum of values is mapped to discrete one by choosing spacing in integration techniques but on the other hand one also uses the term discrete when referring to the values spin frac frac that the system can take namely spin up and down but we do not say that spin is quantized or do we from quantization most common is the idea of quanta of energy that comes in discrete packets of energy hbar omega when solving the set of possible eigenvalues for the hydrogen atom and hence discovering discrete set of energy values that difference always by an integral amount of certain quanta so one refers to the energy here as being quantized on the other hand quantization is also term used in qft when describing on fundamental level what defines the particle picture first quantization and the wave description second quantization my questions are is it true to say that quantization or more specifically quantity in physics being quantized implies discreteness or is this conceptually completely nonsensical comparison formulated differently why would it be wrong to call the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom say as discretized instead of quantized do these concepts ever become interchangeable or are always fundamentally different in nutshell the question would be why call it quantum mechanics and not discrete mechanics apologize for the vague character of this post my aim is solely to understand the fundamental difference of these two concepts in physics
206822 imagine large diameter piston filled with water connected to small funnel when you press on the piston slowly but with considerable force the water will move very quickly from the funnel in form of jet but how is it possible on molecular level water molecules are constantly moving about in the piston with various speeds and directions bumping into each other and exchanging momentum like billiard balls however water molecules from the funnel are moving uniformly at great speed want to know how it is possible for slow molecules to be adding momentum to the ones that are already moving faster than the average in billiard ball analogy slow moving ball moving in the same direction would never catch up with the faster one to further increase its momentum and if it was moving in the opposite direction then it could only receive momentum from the faster one and therefore only slow it down now imagine that this question probably sounds silly but cant find any answer after searching for it so decided to ask here
207201 the boiling point of liquid is defined as the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the external atmospheric pressure that being the case why in pot of boiling water does the water have pretty stable liquid air interface why are bubbles seen as coming from inside the body of water if boiling is essentially defined as surface phenomenon
207295 while making cup of tea in the office kitchen colleague asked me this question and neither of us could answer with any certainty were guessing it has something to do with the pressure of the column of water or temperature differences between the top and bottom but does anyone know the real reason

207421 theres not so recent video by user named quirkology here where he shows bets that usually work from he puts wine bottle cap at the center of glass filled halfway with water and this cap eventually moves to the sides qquad qquad and the trick he shows to make the cap rest at the center without touching it is to add water until the glass if entirely filled then the cap rests in the center qquad qquad does anyone have an explanation of that phenomenon
207644 we know that the sum of the masses of the quarks in proton is approximately text mev whereas the mass of proton is approx931 text mev this extra mass is attributed to the kinetic energy of the confined quarks and the confining field of the strong force now when we talk about energetically favourably bound systems they have total mass energy less than the sum of the mass energies of the constituent entities how does proton bound system of quarks with its mass energy so much more than its constituent entities remain stable the strong force and other energetic interactions supposedly contribute this mass energy by the mass energy equivalence principle but how exactly does this occur
207816 for practical purposes im considering non rotating black hole or neutron star because find kerr black holes little confusing the ratio between orbital velocity and escape velocity in newtonian physics is frac text escape text orbit sqrt ive read several times that the escape velocity at the event horizon is exactly the speed of light mentioned here among other places at the photon sphere at times the schwarzschild radius the orbital speed is so photon can orbit the black hole but this is weird because it seems to be the case that near black hole orbital speed is greater than the escape velocity can this be explained in layman terms is there an error in my train of thought if somebody wants to do the math thats cool but im not sure id understand it assuming the premise of the first question isnt flawed does this happen around dense neutron star as well dense neutron stars may also have photon spheres wiki says its possible andrew says its not whether neutron stars can or cant make photons fly in circles isnt strictly relevant to this question but they are dense enough to not be far off and perhaps get relativistic effects and perhaps that funky relation where orbital velocity approaches and even surpasses escape velocity which makes absolutely no sense is there neat and tidy mathematical relation between orbital speed and escape velocity for these ultra high gravity situations
207906 looking at the second paragraph of page here is the half life given measured in the rest frame of the muon then the calculation shows that the time to reach sea level from the muons perspective is less than its half life measured in its rest frame this explains why so many reach sea level but could we have drawn the same conclusion by instead working out the half life of the muon in our frame then tau would be multiplied by factor of gamma in our frame to give value more than times10 equally explaining why so many reach sea level am right in thinking it would be clearer if tau was labelled tau in the text instead since my understanding is that its the half life measured in the muons frame
208014 this morning it was particularly foggy and my son was excitedly looking at the sun through the fog since of course he normally cant look directly at it and see the disk told him to stop looking directly at it and said that the fog blocked some wavelengths but not others and so it could still be dangerous given that hes years old im sure it was the right advice from parenting perspective we can worry about nuance when hes older and fogs can shift quickly but was it correct from physics perspective does dense fog allow through invisible wavelengths which might be harmful to the retina or does it block other wavelengths the same as visible light
208516 this is joked about all the time but can tin foil hats actually block anything if they can what frequencies is there any research into tin or aluminum foil and radio blocking or amplifying abilities when shaped into hat if they really dont do anything what would be better radio blocking in hat design that is not faraday cage suit with matching tie edit people seem to be missing the tags so ll clarify the questions what frequencies mainly on the radio range can tin foil when shaped into hat block or at least attenuate if not are there any frequencies that resonate amplify within the hat what would work better for signal blocking in this regard to the head that is yes this is funny subject but lets actually take look at the physics there are related questions to the hat but believe they fall outside the scope here if someone wants to ask those on the exchange sites go ahead
209522 in kick boxing when fighters leg hits an opponents leg the outcome based on newtons 3rd law should be the same for each fighter its not even important who kicked who as in the moment of contact the attacker should feel more less the same as the defender here is catch in most of situations different parts of the fighters bodies collide the attacker typically contacts the front of his leg with the defenders side the front is harder is it hardness that makes the difference some web pages inform me that because of the 3rd law fighter should make powerful but very brief hits retracting kicking leg before it receives reaction but from what know if you dont feel reaction there was no action in the first place how is it ever possible to take advantage in martial arts hit and win
209828 this question goes to very basic non understanding of mine that have had in the back of my mind for ages just read the following here ion thrusters are capable of propelling spacecraft up to meters per second over miles per hour mph to put that into perspective the space shuttle is capable of top speed of around mph the tradeoff for this high top speed is low thrust or low acceleration thrust is the force that the thruster applies to the spacecraft modern ion thrusters can deliver up to newtons pounds of thrust which is equivalent to the force you would feel by holding nine quarters in your hand so when it hits the top speed what is the bottle neck the logical thing to me is that it takes more and more electricity to maintain the pounds of thrust but if this is the case does this not violate the premise that you cannot tell how fast you are going without something to compare to in other words if turn the engine on and then off again repeatedly should expect different results from one time to the next know im confused about something very basic here thats why im asking
209854 while explaining to my nephew about the physics of light told him we cannot see infrared color and he kicked back with very simple question why cant we see it could not tell him is the human eye unable to sense such light or can it indeed but the brain cant understand the signal any other reason
210087 in the following online article http www star le ac uk sav2 stats html see the word bin used in relation to ray spectroscopy both as verb and as noun people both bin things and talk about each bin ive also heard it batted about in other places there seems to be very good explanation of why we would bin but the article doesnt seem to say what this process actually means on searching up the term see all sorts of definitions but mostly to do with photometrics rather than quote the areas of the article which dont understand simply ask that given the context of spectroscopy what bin means
210552 yesterday friend asked me what dirac delta function really is tried to explain it but eventually confused myself it seems that dirac delta is defined as function that satisfies these constraints delta quad text if quad neq delta infty quad text if quad int infty infty deltax dx have seen approximation of the dirac delta function as an infinitely peaked gaussian have also seen interpretation of dirac delta function as fourier transform which is widely adopted in study of quantum theory so what really is dirac delta function is it function or is it some kind of limit for large class of functions am really confused
211246 is there physical reason behind the frequency and voltage in the mains electricity do not want to know why exactly certain value was chosen am rather interested to know why that range order of magnitude was selected why hz and not hz or hz for example is hz the actual frequency at which turbine rotates and is it not practical to build one that rotates much faster or slower
211293 does collapsing and re establishing magnetic field impart force on stationary charged particle does the charge particle get repelled and or attracted does it move or spin
211444 as einstein was seeking relativistic theory of gravity he thought that special relativity should be upgraded to general relativity thus promoting the minkowski space to curved pseudo riemannian lorentzian one does this mean that special relativity as theory never discussed gravity from any perspective
211706 the frictional force acting on body placed on horizontal plane is mu where is the normal reaction and is equal to weight of body in this case and mu is the coefficient of friction but if gravity is zero then is the frictional force zero ignoring all other friction due to atmosphere etc if friction is zero then how do astronauts in spaceship experiencing zero gravity move saw so many question related to this on this site but they give explanations on cosmological effects on it but here avoid all such effects and want answer to only this specific question

211773 what is the physical significance of curl nabla times boldsymbol mean read curl represents the rotation of the vector my question what is it about the term nabla times boldsymbol that it represents the rotation of the vector
211857 in chapter of david tongs qft notes he uses the term number without ever defining it here is the first place however its easy to check by direct substitution that the left hand side is simply number function with the integral expression deltax int 3p over pi over 2e vec ip cdot ip cdot here is the second place on the same page page should mention however that the fact that phix phiy is number function rather than an operator is property of free fields only my question is what does number function mean
211908 my book says the point of application of the buoyancy force is the geometric centercentroid of the submerged part of the body whereas the specific gravity of the fluid is constant but why buoyancy is applied on centroid
212142 the word mode pops up in many fields of physics yet cant remember ever encountering simple but precise definition after having searched fruitlessly on this site as well feel that even though it seems like trivial question an easy to find place with one or more good answers is in order objective ideally answers should give graspable intuitive and easy to remember definition of what mode is preferably in general context if limitation is necessary for more detailed answer assume context of theoretical physics mode expansions in quantum field theory
212287 our value for the planck constant can be found on experiments on earth but how do we know that the planck constant doesnt change throughout space for instance it depends weakly upon the curvature of spacetime as far as know we have only done experiments to determine the value of close to the earths surface so dont think theres any direct evidence to suggest it should be constant throughout all space so proposed the idea to my friends one called me nut and said that the value for planck constant has to be the same throughout all space otherwise the conservation of energy would be violated he put forward the following situation suppose that in one region of space the planck constant is found to be in si units call this space and you have photon of frequency hertz this photon then traveled to different region in space where the value for the planck constant is now in si unitscall this space hence the photon has gone from having joule of energy to joules of energy by the relation hf in his own words twitch of finger here can cause an explosion in different region in space to this replied so what as far as know the conservation of energy argument derives from the fact that space looks the same everywhere we look and if the planck constant was really different in different areas of space then that argument shouldnt hold and conservation of energy shouldnt hold either even if did want to abuse this system by creating feedback loop where the energy got larger and larger the point was if ever tried to extract energy from space back to space it would become small amount of energy again since the value for decreases another friend called me nut because he believed that in sending the photon from space to space would violate the second law of thermodynamics by decreasing the overall entropy he didnt really expand on it and believe neither of us have the abilities to calculate the actual entropy change so this point remains unresolved finally another friend called me nut because he believed that if the value for was different in different regions of space then all our calculations ever done in physics dealing with the stars and their brightness and so on and so forth were all incorrect and that would be troubling to this replied that firstly the changes in the value for could possibly be very small for normal regions of space and secondly that there was nothing inherently wrong about all these other calculations weve done being wrong in fact we know they are wrong already because we cant account for either dark matter or dark energy so in my mind this wasnt really good argument as to why the planck constant couldnt be variable over space with all that being said im still fairly certain that the planck constant is constant over space because it is called constant so is there an error in my previous arguments or what is the conclusive reason that the planck constant cannot be variable over space
212421 so was chatting with friend and we noticed something that might be very very very stupid but found it at least intriguing consider minkowski spacetime the trace of matrix can be written in terms of the minkowski metric as eta mu nu mu nu eta mu nu mu nu mu mu what about the trace of the metric notice that eta mu mu cannot be written as eta mu nu eta mu nu because this is equal to not it seemed to us that there is some kind of divine rule that says you shall not lower nor raise indexes of the metric because eta mu nu eta nu alpha delta mu alpha neq eta mu alpha is the metric immune to index manipulations is this notation flaw or am being ultra dumb
212494 lets say youd put whooping big rocket engine on the surface of the moon and slow down its orbital velocity not to complete stop mind you just bit slower than it was going before couple of intuitively without doing the maths or even knowing the maths involved id say it would start spiralling towards earth eventually crashing into it was wondering about this due to this yt video about kerbal space program that talks about how much it would take to stop moon figured that you dont need that much delta that much smaller amount of slow down would already eventually de orbit moon already is that correct
212546 the minimum energy required to excite hydrogen electron is ev when photons of energy spread over continuous range of wavelengths fall on sample of hydrogen why are only those photons absorbed which have energies corresponding to exact energy differences between the allowed states for transition requiring energy nu photon with frequency nu nu can be absorbed with the remaining energy delta nu nu appearing as kinetic energy of the atom this would result in continuous spectrum however with no missing frequencies
212895 from an hydrostatic point of view the pressure in fluid should be the same at the same depth altitude obviously in our atmosphere that does not happen am guessing that the main reason is the fact that the atmosphere cannot be regarded as hydrostatic is this the reason how exactly can we explain these pressure differences understand that higher pressure region must have higher density and therefore it would take time for reducing such density gradient but how fast is this in the order of the speed of sound or it has nothing to do with it
212962 have these questions related to my question title do we other species and things have our own gravity how much gs human have are we effecting earth nearby moons and planets with our gravity
213279 while playing kerbal space program wondered where my chemical energy would go when fired at to the motion it would do no work on the rocket but all that energy has to go somewhere right anyway my question is where does the energy go
213337 here is man in box with wheels on frictionless surface case the person constantly pushes the box while standing near its wall why doesn it move know it is because of the 3rd law but am not able to understand the why here please explain case if he runs inside the box will it move backwards due to the force of his feet case if he runs from the right side to the left one and just before colliding with the left side of the box he jumps and while he is in the air he collides with the box will it move
213886 many people have been using very confusing and sometimes contradictory language when describing electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation its going to be hard to word this question so everyone understands so im going to use some examples want to know if there is simply one large electromagnetic field that is affected by magnets electricity and electromagnetic radiation if not does that mean that each magnet each electric flow and each photon of electromagnetic radiation creates separate electromagnetic field all of which overlap but do not interfere with each other my understanding is that if electromagnetic fields or waves can interfere with each other then they are really all just manipulations of one large electromagnetic field that fills all of space much like the higgs field or spacetime does in that understanding would photons electromagnetic waves simply be waves in that field here is an experiment example say did variation of the double slit experiment in this variation instead of having one source that emits electromagnetic radiation from behind the two slits there are two sources one at each slit in essence im performing two single slit experiments right next to each other projecting onto the same surface instead of firing only one photon at time each source fires single photon at time both sources firing at the same time have two predictions for what would happen one for if there is one large electromagnetic field that fills all of space and one for if each electromagnetic field is separate the top image is my prediction of what the result would look like if each field is separate and by implication the waves do not interfere the bottom image is my prediction if there is single electromagnetic field and the waves in the field can interfere with each other guess good change in vocabulary could help imagine an electromagnetic continuum much like the spacetime continuum in the spacetime continuum gravitational field would simply be bending warping of the spacetime continuum in that sense an electromagnetic field would be bending or warping of the electromagnetic continuum and oscillations of the electromagnetic continuum would be electromagnetic waves radiation good way of phrasing my question with that use of vocabulary would be does an electromagnetic continuum exist or is it all just separate electromagnetic fields and oscillations hope these examples give enough information for you to understand my questions and correct any misconceptions may have thanks
214552 update to make my question more precise ill define what mean by an operator theory an operator theory is theory in which the dynamical objects are operators the equations of motion are imposed on operators wave function theory on the other hand is theory in which the dynamical objects are functions of space time the equations of motion are imposed on functions in wave function theories we have differential operators nabla but these arent dynamical so there is clear distinction between an operator and differential operator to make the distinction more evident ill place hats hat square over dynamical operators at the first stages of the old non relativistic quantum theory heisenberg developed theory in which the fundamental objects were operators namely the position and momentum operators begin align frac mathrm mathrm dt hat xt hat hat frac mathrm mathrm dt hat pt hat hat end align tag qm more or less one year later schr dinger published new theory in which the fundamental object is just function of space time partial psix frac 2m delta psix vx psix tag qm later on schr dinger proved that the two formulations are actually equivalent nowadays we have qft which is an operator theory because the equations of motion are imposed on fields operators for example scalar field hat phi evolves through begin align frac mathrm mathrm dt hat phix hat phi hat frac mathrm mathrm dt hat pix hat pi hat end align tag qft where hat pi is the field conjugate to hat phi to me it seems more or less natural to ask about possible mathrm qft formulation of qft as wave function theory begin array text non relativistic text relativistic text operator theory mathrm qm mathrm qft text wave function theory mathrm qm quad end array imho functional methods path integrals belong to an operator point of view believe it is not possible to use path integrals to calculate for example scattering amplitudes without using operators sooner or later which means that path integrals dont actually fit in the slot my questions has someone done anything similar to schr dinger in the sense of reformulating qft using solely functions of space time and differential operators is there any theory of relativistic quantum mechanics in which the formalisms consists of pdes if the answer to the first question is that no wave function theory exists as for today then is there any reason to expect that there will never be mean is there no go theorem or an argument that suggests that it is impossible to formulate qft as wave function theory my thoughts on this any relativistic theory of interactions must be able to describe creation annihilation phenomena which operators easily do through aa dagger but single wave function must have fixed number of space time arguments so the number of particles must be fixed this means that one wave function will not suffice wave function theory of interactions must therefore consist in an infinite number of wave functions each with different number of space time arguments begin align psix psix 1x psix 1x 2x cdots end align which means that we must have an infinite number of pdes one for each psi and the solutions must be consistent with the operator formulation of qft we must prove that the new formulation is equivalent to the old one believe that the easier way to archive this is to use the correlation functions of qft or point functions begin align psix langle hat phix rangle psix 1x langle hat phix hat phix rangle psix 1x 2x langle hat phix hat phix hat phix rangle cdots end align with this it should be possible in principle to find the pdes for the psi in terms of the pdes for hat phi this means we should use partial hat phi hat to get begin align mathcal psix mathcal jx mathcal psix 1x mathcal jx 1x mathcal psix 1x 2x mathcal jx 1x 2x cdots end align for some differential operators mathcal and some sources mathcal once we find the appropriate mathcal mathcal there will be no explicit reference to any operator and we only use wave functions of course these wave functions dont have the same probabilistic interpretation of non relativistic qm but this is irrelevant the point is to find an equivalent formulation of qft using just functions of spacetime dont know if this makes much sense or whether there is better approach any comment will be appreciated
214674 is there mathematical and physical reason believe it follows from the jacobian of the lorentz transformation but if that is so dont see why it would be obvious unless you can do such calculations instantly in your head what is the physical meaning of the invariance of lorentz measure is it just conservation of momentum
214950 im complete layperson as understand dark matter theoretically only interacts with the gravitational force and doesnt interact with the other three fundamental forces weak nuclear force strong nuclear force and electromagnetism those are my understandings going in if im wrong please correct me ive done some googling and havent found anything confirming or denying that dark matter is affected by either of the fundamental nuclear forces so since dark matter only interacts with gravity what causes any dark matter particle to be repelled from another if they can pass freely through each other and they are gravitationaly attracted to each other why dont such particles clump together in single point in space it seems to me that particles occupying single space are philosophically not distinct particles but dont know how actual physics would play into this edit this article authors credentials unknown but implicitly claims to be physicist or astronomer says hysicists generally take all dark matter to be composed of single type of particle that essentially interacts only through gravity edit the author is this lisa randall professor of science on the physics faculty of harvard university
215047 watched video on youtube and read few articles which say that human beings see 3d because we have two eyes but does that mean when close one of my eyes should see 2d it doesnt happen so why am still able to be understand depth would person with one eye not be able to perceive depths
215220 background recently read that group had managed to overcome both the communication loophole and the detection loophole for bells theorem in reading the article started to think about another issue which had not realized upon first learning about quantum entanglement am aware that entanglement does not necessarily mean one can communicate faster than the speed of light in vacuum1 am also aware2 that entanglement shows the wave function need not be local what thought about after reading the article was that regardless of these issues one could never physically separate two particles faster than the speed of light so even if we did manage to use entanglement as near instantaneous communication method we would not necessarily violate relativity because the entangled particles cannot be separated faster than question assume someone has already thought of this but am curious if am thinking about this correctly3 have misunderstood fundamental aspect of entanglement am focusing on trivial non issue and missing the bigger picture or am understanding at least part of the issue correctly footnotes well actually two different quantum professors told me two different things one said it was possible to use entanglement for communication the other said it was not possible aware at mathematical level not really an intuitive level used the soft question tag because doubt my formulation of this question is rigorous however my lack of knowledge experience with the deeper parts of quantum like entanglement make it very difficult to constrain question as well as would like
215353 am trying to figure out how undefined formulas in mathematics relates to physics take the following formula for terminal velocity text terminal sqrt mg over rho say we have an air density of rho vacuum logic tells me the particle would continue to accelerate and never reach terminal velocity but in mathematics this formula would be undefined obviously this is one of many examples of what can happen in physics problems but what does undefined actually mean in terms of physics hope am explaining myself clearly
215747 am student of class when was going through magnetism and read that an earth is magnet got some doubts my question is is earth really magnet doesn anyone have any proof that earth is magnet is there magnetic core at the center of the earth has anyone reached the core of the earth
215788 in one of my physics classes we are using slow motion video to analyze the falling motion of an object and then find out the drag coefficient of that object etc noticed while doing this that if dropped our object styrofoam bowl with cone of sorts attached to the top from any position it would always flip and fall tip down if dropped from high enough there was of course certain height when it would not flip and would fall slowly to the floor asked my question to the professor and he said he wasnt completely sure and that the only relevant knowledge he had was that some high atmosphere ice crystals which are basically square shaped fall with the square side down rather than sideways no doubt there are many examples of objects not falling in their most aerodynamic position so heres the way im picturing this imagine it is something like each object which falls in particular orientation has reached minimum or maximum on potential energy curve except that guess this curve would represent minimums in the drag force and the reason then that many objects would not fall in their most aerodynamic position is because the energy barriers between that position and the next minimum are very small im picturing piece of paper falling for instance paper would fall fastest with its edge to the ground yet it often teeters back and forth between that position and falling with its full area facing downwards so any thoughts on this idea and just general answers to what determines which direction an object will face while falling
215809 in my sophomore year of high school my teachers kept on complaining about how phones didnt have network connection in our gym regardless of model service provider etc couple of feet outside the gym cellular reception was crystal clear however as you moved your phone towards the gym wall it rapidly diminished in strength couple of months after taking ap physics my mind randomly drifted back to this event and it came to me that this is what one would expect to happen if the gym were giant faraday cage is this even possible or likely considering usage of fairly standard building materials and structural design heres an image of the building its the one in the foreground if that helps
216276 if blackbody has temperature such that its peak frequency was well within our audible range for example mathrm khz what would that sound like if we used plancks law to plot its spectral curve in the frequency domain and performed transformation like an inverse fft to obtain waveform plancks law tells us the peak wavelength and electromagnetic spectral emission curve of an ideal radiator an some temperature if we know the peak frequency then we can work backwards to figure its peak wavelength lambda for our example if mathrm khz then lambda approx170 mathrm so approx17 mathrm nk if we plot the power spectral density of nanokelvin blackbody as function of frequency and performed an inverse fft on that curve what would the resulting waveform sound like according to this wikipedia article blackbody radiation is just thermal noise johnson nyquist noise if thats what im looking for what does it sound like just to clarify im looking for waveform maybe wav file rather than verbal description
216342 while deriving bernoullis theorem our teacher said that the sum of ke pe and pressure energy per unit volume remains constant at any two points rho frac rho text constant in this he stated that the first term is pressure energy per unit volume what exactly is meant by pressure energy know we can write dfrac dfrac cdot cdot dfrac dfrac text energy what is physical significance and expression of pressure energy
216479 when the capacitor is fully charged there is potential difference between its poles and that creates current this current would create magnetic field that is changing in the inductor because the current changes due to the capacitor creating an emf in the circuit wouldnt this inductors emf counteract the discharging capacitor and actually charge it stop the capacitor from fully discharging from what understand as the current from the capacitor decreases exponentially the emf created by the inductor would increase exponentially at some point the emf of the inductor should be bigger than the voltage difference between the poles of the capacitor and that may not be when the capacitor is fully discharged can someone explain why then the capacitor does fully discharge before the inductor starts creating current in the opposite direction
216495 according to this article the rogue planet meaning planet which does not orbit star pso j318 has surface temperature of and weather that features molten iron rain without star pumping energy into its atmosphere how does it maintain these temperatures the linked article doesnt explain nor does its wikipedia page is this typical for rogue planets had always assumed planet with no star would be more cold and barren than pluto
216577 could you clarify to me what is gaussian state know what is gaussian function and gaussian distribution but dont know how to respond to other when they ask me to provide the definition of gaussian state thank you
216629 if stars are formed by the collapse of dust clouds under gravity how is the pressure of the dust cloud overcome as more material gathers together gravity will increase but pressure will also increase if am not mistaken both will increase as the volume shrinks but gravity as function of the square of the radius of the gas cloud and pressure as function of the cube of its radius by this reasoning we would not expect gravity to be able to overcome the hydrostatic pressure and compress material together sufficiently to form star what then is the accepted explanation that allows stars to form under gravity from dust clouds
217025 was playing with small ruler by repeatedly toppling it see diagram below the ruler standing tall and approximately regular bar is prevented from free rotating by fixed ridge book usually in point and then allowed to topple until it hits the xz plane my desk and the ruler both have quite smooth hard surfaces and cant help noticing that after impact the ruler slides along the surface in the direction for bit until it is halted by friction this suggests the ruler had momentum in the direction after impact with the desks surface but cant work out where it comes from is some of the rotational kinetic energy the ruler acquired during toppling converted to translational kinetic energy on impact if so how the forces acting on the centor of gravity of the ruler are shown in the right hand top corner of the diagram obviously its the moment frac th thats causing rotation around and the equation of motion is frac th ddot theta with mg sin theta and ddot theta omega frac mathrm omega mathrm theta so frac mgh sin theta mathrm theta omega mathrm omega integrated between and frac pi omega we get frac omega frac mgh frac mgh is of course simply the amount of potential energy that has been converted to kinetic energy by lowering the cog from to now lets look at point in mg cos theta has to be countered to prevent the ruler from moving radially from to the cog or vice versa decomposing we get mg cos theta sin theta but at theta pi vanishes so it cant be that force thats responsible for any horizontal motion clearly im missing something here but what is it
217034 have always had hard time accepting the concept of superposition from quantum mechanics know that the leading physicists say that the cat is both alive and dead until it is observed and that an electron is in multiple places at once is wave until it is observed but sadly have never been convinced ive taken basic course on the subject and watched countless documentaries that explain this but have hard time accepting that we can change the state of the world just by observing questions that have popped into my head are things like what if brain dead person looks and doesnt comprehend what if take picture and dont look at that picture for years later is the cat both alive and dead for years all because didnt look at the picture what if friend and flip coin and only look when asked which came up would say heads and he would say both are we both right doesnt my absolute knowledge make him wrong it seems like the trend in science has always been to show us how small and irreverent we are from finding out that we are not at the center the universe to finding out that we are just one planet of many in one solar system of many in one galaxy of many and possibly even in one universe of many to finding out that all life on earth came from the same place making us less special then we thought to finding out that our genetic code is filled with genetic bloat and the little left over is nearly identical to banana after all that find out that am in fact so special that all matter in the universe ceases to exist when close my eyes currently am one of those people that think that moon is there even when im not looking can someone point me convincing argument for all this so that can finally be convinced edit what gathered from the replies so far is that superposition is way of representing our uncertainty of an answer by saying that cat is in state between life and death we are actually saying that we dont know in mathematically describable way this would imply that our observation does not change reality it only changes our certainty but what about electrons acting like waves going through slits at once when were not observing and like particles being visible electrons when we are observing in the double slit experiment this seems to show that they are both in reality and indicates that our observation does change reality which of the two it is at the moment this is the contradiction that struggle with and if am wrong about my interpenetration please correct me re edit think im understanding this now the only remaining issue is this the electrons in the double slit experiment that act like waves before we look and like particles after we look are exposed to the environment gas photons etc the whole time shouldnt it be one or the other the whole time due to this exposure
217545 read about joules experiment proving the transformation of mechanical work into heat but say have bowl with some water and start turning spoon in it very fast thus doing work the water wont get hotter what am missing think maybe the work put is simply kinetic and wont turn into heat but then how do you explain joules experiment
217567 why is it that in non equilibrium hydrodynamic modelling when the solution is time dependent people use equations of state that are derived from equilibrium considerations the ideal gas law or an ideal fermi gas eos etc
217589 wont pretend understand even the basics of qft but from what ive heard about electrons there are really two main ways of thinking about them quantum mechanics describes an electron by wave function whos squared magnitude gives the probability of finding the electron in certain position or with certain momentum qft from what understand describes the electron as an excitation of the electron field both of these models describe the electron as some excitation of mathematical field permeating space and time my question is this if an electron really is described in this way either using wave function or field what properties of the field or of space time itself make it so the electron is stable the excitation does not spontaneously decay stop existing or change what causes the electron to continuously remain the same from one moment to the next
217821 when incident light passes through hydrogen gas for example does it have chance since its ratio of protons to electrons of getting absorbed by the proton any chance at all if no why not does proton have bandgap if yes what happens when photon is absorbed by proton
218051 gravity causes anything with energy to accelerate toward the source black holes for example have such strong gravity that they pull in light and dont let any escape but can acceleration still apply to light the speed of light is constant of course but why are photons affected by gravity yet arent accelerated by it edit my main question is why photons arent affected in the same way as most other particles im perfectly aware that it cannot surpass lightspeed but want to know what makes it unaffected by acceleration while other particles are affected
218370 schwartzs quantum field theory text has an interesting question havent figured out consider spinor interaction of the form overline psi psi overline psi psi in the path integral formulation spinors are grassmann numbers so this interaction would be represented as some product of grassmann numbers theta theta theta theta however since grassmann numbers anticommute this quantity is zero thus the interaction does nothing at all is this argument correct the conclusion sounds wild do these interactions really automatically vanish whats going on
218614 my teacher explained to me that we volume is an extensive property because it is additive in nature but he also told us that pressure is an intensive property now according to the gas law equation pv nrt pressure is dependent on volume increasing pressure should increase volume so shouldnt pressure be extensive as well
218668 know that for an object to be transparent visible light must go through it undisturbed in other words if the light energy is sufficiently high to excite one of the electrons in the material then it will be absorbed and thus the object will not be transparent on the other hand if the energy of the light is not sufficient to excite one of the electrons in the material then it will pass through the material without being absorbed and thus the object will appear transparent my question is for non transparent object like brick when the light is absorbed by an electron it will eventually be re emitted when the light is re emitted wont the object appear transparent since the light will have essentially gone through the object
218983 noticed long time ago the similarity between schrodinger equation and euler bernoulli beam equation namely euler bernoulli equation is equivalent to the system of schrodinger equation for free particle and its complex conjugate euler bernoulli equation for vibrations of beams psi here amplitude of bending young modulus etc frac yi rho frac partial psi partial frac partial psi partial if we transform the beam parameters to particle parameters appropriately frac hbar 4m frac partial psi partial frac partial psi partial left frac hbar 2m frac partial partial frac partial partial right left frac hbar 2m frac partial partial frac partial partial right psi which is obviously system of two schrodinger equations psi becomes wavefunction frac hbar 2m frac partial psi partial frac partial psi partial frac hbar 2m frac partial psi partial frac partial psi partial the main mathematical difference between the solution of this system and single schrodinger equation is of course that here psi psi which is not true in quantum mechanics since complex conjugation is equivalent to time reversal and momentum reversal for free particle also the general solution of contains cosh and sinh as well as cos and sin and thus requires four boundary conditions instead of two but the omegak spectrum is the same for both equations so do you think there is any physical meaning for this mathematical similarity or can it prove to be in any way useful like in modeling the behavior of particles with acoustic experiments
219133 came across this article new derivation of pi links quantum physics and pure math in which they discuss about recent discovery of deriving pi from physics am not physicist or mathematician and able to grasp only little can you explain the discovery and its significance for simpleton like me please forgive me if am wrong but pi can be derived from sphere volume also frac pi so why this discovery is different
219282 when discussing the vibrating string problem with one end or both free to move in the vertical direction but constrained in the longitudinal direction achieved by placing the free end in frictionless sleeve for example it is generally accepted that the proper boundary condition to impose at that end is the homogeneous neumann condition that is frac partial partial where is the vertical displacement and is the longitudinal space coordinate have looked in few books and couldnt find rigorous explanation of why this boundary condition should be enforced the authors usually vaguely stating that this is due to the lack of force at the open end has someone encountered more detailed explanation of this
219582 as many books say temperature is proportional almost etc average kinetic energy of particles my question is this suppose there is body somewhere in empty space which moves at velocity thus possessing ke not equal to joules but has temperature equal to 0k can this be possible in theoretical sense in my view it is possible since think is measure of ke only for non coherently moving particles and if all particles of the body move coherently in one direction ke will not be equal to joules but will be kelvin since in the case of classical thermodynamics the engine carnot engine does not move as whole it does not possess any coherent ke only random ke and thus the heuristic temperature is average ke works just fine but this rule of thumb breaks down if the body moves as whole am right
219681 since they are postulate of general relativity it is not really possible to derive the einstein field equations ab left lambda frac rightg ab pi ab in any very meaningful way it is however possible to come up with derivation like constructions that yield some insight what are some of these
219710 why do quarks tend to bond in groups of three understand why they might in bond in groups of three to create net charge of zero neutrons but dont understand why they form protons and not for example commonly form in groups of four have done background research on this question and did not find any information the wikipedia article on baryons https en wikipedia org wiki baryon was not helpful either to summarize why are mesons and baryons more common than other hadrons
219806 why are there different official definitions for kilogram and for meter when meter can be defined by the volume of kilogram of water for instance using the triple point or some other state where the volume is well defined
219897 the idea that as you move through the earth you get symmetric cancelling of gravitational acceleration which approaches zero acceleration due to gravity at the center of the earth makes lot of sense think also think that is pretty easy idea to understand physically on the other hand am just beginning to study and understand the general relativistic explanation for gravity and im wondering how this same idea is explained using general relativity that is what is the explanation for why gravitational acceleration decreases linearly if im not mistaken as you approach the center of the earth using general relativity specifically would like to understand what is going on with the curvature of spacetime in this scenario is it becoming less curved some math would be appreciated in answers
220112 know this sounds like and probably is stupid question but cant figure it out as far as know the crescent shape of the moon is when the moon is on the sunny side of the earth but that wouldnt explain how it can be seen from the night horrible not to scale and probably completely wrong diagram of what think here how is it that we can see clear to the other side of the earth
220329 have question on kinematics say the path traced by particle is given by koch curve or koch snowflake now consider the particle starts from some arbitrary point on the curve and continues moving with some acceleration it moves finite distance on the curve and reaches another point which is different from and the particle has not crossed the same point twice so there is net finite displacement covered in finite time hence the particle has finite average velocity but the curve is not differentiable at any point by definition of the curve so the particle has no instantaneous velocity at all points of the path taken question can particle have no instantaneous velocity at all points of the path taken but still finite average velocity is this possible can anyone explain this
221027 im making examples of wave functions to incorporate in qm exam came up with the following wave function which gives me some troubles psix0 begin cases aa leq leq text otherwise end cases this is basically quick modification of problem of griffiths 2nd edition which thought would make things easier for the first problem of the exam after the usual normalization of which give sqrt frac 8a want to then have the students compute the expectation values of and and then verify the uncertainty principle this is where it gets tricky get langle rangle frac and langle rangle frac 2a easily for the momentum though get langle rangle frac 3i hbar 4a in mathbb an imaginary number how is that possible what does that mean am doing something wrong in the calculation am wondering if it is because of the form of the function in and
221339 the iconic cooling towers at most nuclear power plants are shaped like hyperboloids wikipedia mentions that this is because the wide base promotes thin film evaporation and the narrow point accelerates the laminar flow out of all the shapes with wide base and narrow middle why are hyperboloids the preferred structure for cooling tower also most cooling towers ive seen have the hyperboloid shape extend past the narrowest point by what appears to be roughly the same amount is there reason for this
221395 while was making morning coffee at work some sugar from the spoon started to fly away seemingly towards some foam cups can this be explained by magnetism
221851 for the hermitian and traceless generators of the fundamental representation of the sun algebra the anticommutator can be written as at frac delta ab cdot1 abc where delta ab text tr at is the normalization chosen for the generators note that they are also chosen orthogonal for the fundamental representation and is the dimensional identity matrix for the fundamental representation it seems possible to deduce this expression by arguing that the anticommutator is hermitian and hence can be written in terms of the traceless generators and one matrix with non vanishing trace does this expression hold for general representation of the generators if yes please explain why and or provide reference the relevance in the above equation appears in trying to express general product at frac frac where the commutator is already known as consequence of the closure of sun
222014 try to make this as short and concise as possible for equilibrium systems in statistical mechanics we have the liouvilles theorem which says that the volume in phase space is conserved when the system evolves in time thus formally one could rephrase this as time evolution of equilibrium stationary systems is measure invariant transformation where the measure here is the volume in phase space now for stationary systems we have density function mathbf mathbf that fulfils liouvilles theorem using which we can write an ensemble average of some phase space function as follows langle rangle int mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf tag similarly the time average of the same function is defined by langle rangle rm time lim to infty frac int atdt tag the most important physically relevant statement of the ergodic theorem is that and are equal the ensemble average and time average of phase space functions are the same this leads to an important interpretation regarding the time evolution of an ergodic system which is that all the regions of the accessible part of phase space consistent with the systems energy are visited by the system regardless of the initial condition at and that the system spends an equal amount of time in all of them this also intuitively explains why the averages and ought to be equal from mathematical point of view we know that the time average converges for all trajectories taken by the system since we started with the equilibrium assumption which allowed us to treat the time evolution as measure preserving transformation the question is how is the ergodic theorem generalized to also account for non equilibrium systems systems with dissipative dynamics and with sources sinks of particles for one thing we no longer have the volume preserving transformation thus liouvilles theorem is violated and the phase space volume is no longer incompressible under time transformations thus evaluating the convergence of and becomes non trivial admittedly the mathematical challenges aside am more interested in the physical aspect of the generalization of the ergodic theory does this concept even extend to non equilibrium if yes how is it interpreted
222284 to start off im not physicist but programmer and only had few years of physics education in high school so im sorry if im asking stupid question just finished watching the movie gravity and found online already whole list of things wrong with the movie but there are two things that think is wrong that couldnt find the premise of the movie is that satellite is hit by missle which causes debris setting off chain reaction leading to the catastrophic destruction of space stations and space shuttles is it true that debris can stay in orbit at the same height as space stations while having very large relative speed to the space stations it was my understanding that if the velocity of objects change then also its orbit altitude given circular orbit right in the end the main character gets to the chinese space station which is already deorbiting although it seems structurally intact is it possible for the intact station to deorbit simply by getting little bit hit it couldnt have been much since it was still mostly intact
222390 they say that gravity is technically not real force and that its caused by objects traveling straight path through curved space and that space becomes curved by mass giving the illusion of force of gravity that makes perfect sense for planetary orbits but lot less sense for the expression of gravity that we are the most familiar with in our day to day lives what goes up must come down imagine that hold ball in my hand several feet off the ground with my fingers curled around it and my hand is above the ball then open my fingers releasing my grip on it being very careful to not impart any momentum to the ball from my hand as do so an object at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by an outside force if the ball is not moving relative to my inertial reference frame it has no path to travel thats any different from the earths path through space it should remain at rest hanging there in the air and yet it falls demonstrating that an outside force gravity did indeed act upon it how does curved space explain this
222622 as the title states see psi written as psi psi instead of psi psi are both correct or is there reason behind it as far as im aware the only time see this sort of ordering being important is when ordering two operators
222736 can we create an amount of energy at point in space and destroy an equal amount of energy at another point in space with both the processes occurring simultaneously this will not violate energy conservation as the total energy in the universe is constant so is it possible
223002 was just thinking today that usually see red flame and have seen plenty of blue flame but not green my naive presumption for coloration of flames would suggest that would see more green so im trying to figure out if there is flaw in my naive understanding my understanding presumption was that the color of the fire was due to the heat something warm would produce inferred waves as result of thermal radiation if you heat an object up enough if will get red hot because its heat is so high that the object is more energetic and ultimately causes the thermal radiation to also produce higher energy waves due to electrons getting excited to higher levels of the valent shell before the degrade back down to their normal levels and thus releasing higher energy with the larger jump back to base energy state further assumed the reason fire is usually red was that the temperature of typical fires we produce is at the right temperature to be emitting light in the red spectrum and the blue flames we see on really hot fires is sign that their temperature is high enough to cause the heated objects air to emit thermal radiation in the blue spectrum etc however green is midway through red and blue on the light spectrum if my naive assumption was right would expect to see hot flames turn green before they turn blue however while blue flames arent that uncommon to me can barely recall seeing green flames which would have thought would require lower heat and thus be easier to produce assume ive over simplified the process with which light is being emitted but im trying to figure out where my error is can anyone better explain to me why green flame seems so much less common assuming the very premise is right
223564 what is state in physics while reading physics have heard many times system is in state but the definition of state was never provided and googling brings me totally unrelated topic of solid state physics but was loosely told that it has every information of the system you desire to know on reading further have found people talking of thermodynamic state lagrangian hamiltonian wave function etc etc which think are different from one another so in general want to know what do we mean by state in physics and is there unique way to describe it
223565 original question the electric pickle is often used as an example of non ohmic resistor in the experiment electric current excites the sodium ions inside pickle producing very bright and intense light effect what am wondering here is that why in many experiments only one end of the pickle glows bounty starters comments recently saw this periodic video the professor martin polyakoff notes that the gherkin normally glows only at one end due to excitation of na ions the end which glows can either be the neutral end or the live end it is impossible to predict which one will glow during the video both ends glowed together only for few seconds even the professor admitted that probably glowing at one end happens due to pure chance why should the gherkin glow only at one end is there any reason normally one would expect it to glow symmetrically around the center that is at both ends the question has been quite well received however no one has commented or answered does the question need to be re worded or better explained do let me know in the comments
223610 the kids way of understanding the expanding universe is that space is totally ordinary and all the galaxies are expanding through it like an explosion of course thats wrong the usual better explanation is that space itself is expanding of course on scales below clusters gravity pulls smaller structures together an even more up to date explanation is that the conceptual metric of space is expanding heres typical pedagogic example which can perhaps be summarized as the scale is changing so distant objects are redshifted but why everythings just expanding the very metric of spacetime is expanding indeed it would seem to me that you would only see redshift or if you prefer time dilation of far away things strictly in the case of everyday motion within the metric of space the very idea of the actual metric of space changing would seem to be that those of us internal to that metric of space would have no clue that any such expansion is happening the scale is just changing for everything whats the best way to understand this imagine simply meter cube in video game with few things in it there is no exterior it is the universe expand the entire thing note of course obviously the outside shadows etc added by the 3d presentation software to clarify the png here have utterly no meaning and do not exist in any way to all the beings inside believe absolutely nothing has changed thered be no redshift between the objects there whats the deal note too this somewhat similar related question which came up with the recent gravitational wave discovery how is it that distortions in space can be measured as distances
223824 was thinking about why the poles are colder and came out with three possible explanations the atmosphere blocks light beams coming to poles the sun is seen only slightly over the horizon at the poles so the light beams have longer way to the poles if only this case were true then the total difference between the poles and the equator would be the same as the energy that was absorbed by the atmosphere sun is only slightly over the horizon at the poles poles are often in shadow of the parts of the earth which are closer to the equator poles are farther from the sun the longer is the way to sun the lower is the chance to catch light from the sun please correct me wherever im wrong id like to know which of these three is most correct how significant are the described effects of the other explanations
223935 suppose want to transport some logs from the ground to the roof of tower originally can use lift or some cables or even move the logs upwards manually then the energy is converted to the potential energy of logs now if build tall water tank from ground to the roof of the tower and fill it with water and suppose that can push the logs from the bottom of the tank with well shaped door then let the logs float to the roof of the tower what is the energy source that used to convert to the potential energy of logs
223991 the zilch of an electromagnetic field is the tensor mu nu rho mu lambda lambda nu rho mu lambda lambda nu rho tag1 given in terms of the electromagnetic field tensor mu nu and therefore in terms of the electric and magnetic fields 0i and tfrac12 epsilon ijk jk and its dual mu nu tfrac12 epsilon mu nu rho sigma rho sigma with commas denoting partial derivatives this tensor is conserved on shell in vacuum in the sense that partial mu mu nu rho partial nu mu nu rho partial rho mu nu rho whenever mu nu satisfies the vacuum maxwell equations partial mu mu nu quad text and quad partial mu mu nu this conservation law which gives in total ten conserved charges was found by lipkin math phys though the form was first given by kibble math phys since its discovery the zilch has apparently been bit of an odd child with its physical interpretation bit out in lurch but it is definitely an integral part of the bigger framework of the conservation laws of the em field to give it bit of more concrete feeling the most accessible component of the zilch is which has been called the optical chirality mathbf cdot frac partial mathbf partial mathbf cdot frac partial mathbf partial this is pseudoscalar odd under parity but otherwise quite similar to the electromagnetic energy density so theres definitely lot of involvement of the lorentz group action in this quantity in general conservation laws tend to have tight association with the symmetry properties of the system noethers theorem provides conservation law for every appropriate symmetry and it has converse which guarantees the existence of symmetries given suitable conservation laws though it seems that the situation is more complicated for gauge theories would like to know how this principle applies to the lipkin zilch tensor in particular if there is no such symmetry would like clear and compelling argument of why this is the case the literature is not particularly clear or for me easy to decode so think its worthwhile asking this outright so that theres clear answer on the record what symmetry of the electromagnetic field is associated with the conservation of lipkins zilch tensor moreover how exactly does this symmetry relate to the conservation law through direct application of noethers theorem or are there more subtleties in play have made some inroads into the literature and im happy to discuss what have read already and what havent found yet but think its probably for the best if just leave this question clean for now
223995 this is question that has been bugging me for while now was wondering about the effects on the earth if it was in different orbital situations to what it is now and one of those was what would happen if somehow the earth was in polar orbit around the sun would the equator be perpendicular to where it is now as well as time zones this is taking that everything else about the earth was the same as it is now its axis distance from the sun and the presence of the moon were all the same

224675 was reading representing electrons biographical approach to theoretical entities by theodore arabatzis at certain point where he is explaining the history of the magnetic moment of the electron he describes the process that led to boldsymbol mu frac 2m boldsymbol the orbital magnetic moment satisfies the relation above with somehow the spin magnetic moment has on page he states that emphasis mine the electron thus acquired an intrinsic magnetic moment one bohr magneton that was twice its magnetic moment due to its orbital motion the question whether that property could be accommodated within the classical electromagnetic representation of the electron then arose indeed on ehrenfests suggestion uhlenbeck managed to explain this property by capitalizing on abrahams analysis of the gyromagnetic ratio of spherical surface distribution of charge on the assumption that the electron was rotating sphere whose charge was distributed on its surface the required value of its magnetic moment followed if im getting this right the author is saying that if we think of the electron as sphere with surface charge distribution we should get the factor using solely classical arguments the thing is tried to check this and my result is that my analysis is as follows suppose that the electron is solid sphere with mass and radius then its moment of inertia is frac mr if we assume that the electron is spinning with angular frequency omega we find that the spin angular momentum is omega frac mr omega on the other hand the magnetic moment of hollow charged sphere is mu frac er omega finally the ratio of mu to is frac mu frac er omega frac frac mr omega frac 2m which means that my question is where did my analysis fail as matter of fact the same claim is given on george uhlenbeck and the discovery of electron spin by abraham pais following hint from ehrenfest george found in an old article by max abraham that an electron considered as rigid sphere with only surface charge does have as pais is respected science historian am to believe the statement is accurate but im still unable to prove this rather simple claim is there any chance the claim is false or is it possible to somehow prove that is true for classical sphere

225413 am quite confused with the groups diff and gl4 mathbb in the context of general relativity understand that the symmetries of gr are the transformations that leave the equations invariant under under continuous smooth coordinate transformations that is automorphisms to form an infinite dimensional lie group the group diff now had the impression that the isometry group of gr is gl4 mathbb and something like that is stated at the wiki page of general covariance in specific it says that more modern interpretation of the physical content of the original principle of general covariance is that the lie group gl4r is fundamental external symmetry of the world am struggling to realise if diff is isomorphic to gl4 mathbb and if in this context talking about diffeomorphism group of gr is the same as talking about gl4 mathbb or if this is subgroup of diff what exactly is their relation
225423 recently learned that hydrogen fusion hydrogen to helium experiments on earth have been successful at temperatures in excess of degrees celsius however also learned that hydrogen fusion in the core of the sun takes place at degrees celsius my question why the difference is it only because the pressure of earths atmosphere is so much less than the pressure in the suns core or are there other factors to be considered thanks
225436 im taking course on general relativity and the notes that im following define killing vector field as those verifying mathcal xg they seem to be very important in physics but dont understand why yet because that definition is the only thing that have so far im not very familiar with the lie derivative so dont know how to interpret that equation so far what is the meaning of the lie derivative of the metric being why are killing fields relevant physically

225733 is the path integral formulation of qm just mathematical tool or does it offer deep physical insights on the nature of qm is it just an alternate way to describe quantum mechanics could someone say that the schrodinger formulation is better worse than the path integral formulation or are they just two different ways to describe the same thing if the later is the correct answer then why did the path integral formulation ever need to be developed does it offer something more that the original formulation does not offer and well to sum it all up is any of the two formulations more fundamental edit am not seeking opinions here am seeking facts what mean by that is for example did this formulation make more connections with classical mechanics did this formulation predict more things or is this formulation regarded as just mathematical toolnot being accepted as what actually goes on
225831 sorry if this is very basic question but am not physicist but this is something that has always intrigued me have read that the properties of black hole are its mass spin and angular momentum and that lower higher the mass higher lower its density and so on although singularities are described by mathematical models its hard at least for me to believe that singularity actually exists in the middle of space in every black hole so why is it that singularities are actually hypothesized can the extremely dense nature etc of black holes not explain its properties with finite volume also whenever black holes are visualized in animations etc its always an event horizon and the observer still keeps falling through what looks like empty space what is the significance and the location of the mass of the black hole itself then ignoring the mass it accumulates radiates throughout its lifetime
226088 with the rapidity phi defined so that frac tanh phi say you have parallel moving reference frames and with constant but different velocity rapidity if the rapidity of in relation to is phi and the rapidity of in relation to is phi then the rapidity of in relation to is phi phi dont really see why this is the case its probably something really simple im missing because theres no further explanation in my syllabus
226266 if you take perfect conductor there cannot be field across it since if there were the particles would arrange themselves in way to cancel out the field right yet why does the same not hold true for wire wire is essentially long thin conductor yet electrons do indeed flow so there must be an electric field does this not contradict with what happens in conductor why dont the electrons re arrange to cancel out the electric field

226745 for the purposes of this question lighter and darker refer to the absorptive qualities of the objects darker objects absorb more light and therefore appear darker im trying to understand the emissivity of lighter versus darker objects get why dark objects absorb more light than lighter ones available energy transitions probability of interaction with photons etc but why do they also emit more thermal radiation im familiar with the thought experiment with light and dark object in an enclosed box reaching equilibrium much better explained here but that is more of proof and not physical explanation do dark objects emit more for the same reasons they absorb more just in reverse

227138 im trying to create simple program that simulates gravity the idea is that have one central sun and several planets that can create with swipe gesture on the screen and use the initial swipe to provide the planets with an initial velocity after some time the planet will eventually start to move around the sun according to newtons law my current approach is at any moment compute the value of the gravitational force that the sun exerts on the planet mp is the mass of the planet and ms is the mass of the sun frac mp ms then find the acceleration value for the planet with frac mp then find the angle theta of the line that connects the center of the planet to the center of the sun next create an acceleration vector along that line by creating its and component begin align ax cos theta ay sin theta end align at the next iteration use this acceleration vector and the time elapsed since the previous iteration to compute the planets velocity and then its position then the whole thing repeats the main problem with this approach is that as soon as the planet reaches distance close to zero from the sun it gets tremendous acceleration and at the next iteration it is simply too far from the sun and just keeps moving along straight line right out of the screen which of course is not what expect from gravity note that still dont have collision detection so what id expect would be the planet to remain kind of still at the center of the sun my intuition is shouting that should use some kind of integration for the acceleration so every acceleration that miss between one iteration and the next would be taken into account and my planet would stop escaping gravity so recovered my math and physics books and tried to figure this out by myself but no luck if got this right the problem is that my acceleration is function of distance so cannot integrate it in order to get the position for the planet because that would require an acceleration as function of time am right whats the right solution to this
227213 have one thing that confuses me on deriving the solution for the linear forced oscillator suppose we have the equation as ma rv kx cos omega what confuses me is when the driving force cos omega is changed to the complex form omega understand that omega comes from eulers identity theta cos theta sin theta however how can cos omega solely by itself change to omega when the driving force is changed to the omega form dont we need to satisfy the euler identity also how can the solution of be ae omega dont quite understand this
227853 there is lot of controversy over the existence of theory of everything toe and as far as know we are long way from having possible candidate but what interests me is what after that if theory of everything is truly found will there be anything left for physics to do is toe actually the end of physics or are there things that will remain unexplained even after toe is found out edit just to make it fit for this site my question is what are the areas of physics that would require working on even if toe is discovered hope have been able to isolate an issue that can be answered in few paragraphs
227960 free electron lasers are devices which use the motion of highly energetic electron beams to produce bright coherent radiation in the ray regime more specifically they start with high energy electron beam and feed it into an undulator which is an array of alternating magnetic fields designed to make the electron beam move in zigzag path with sharp turns on either side emitting synchrotron radiation during each turn the radiation thus produced is added up over successive turns and it is produced coherently via self amplified spontaneous emission one common question frequently posed of this setup is is this actually laser that is does it have population inversion and is the radiation actually emitted via stimulated emission in some suitable understanding of it people in the know tend to answer in the affirmative but ive yet to see nice explanation of why and definitely not online so do fels actually lase
228183 with the confirmation that elements and are indeed fundamental elements that are now to be named on the periodic table the next question is what is the highest atomic number possible for an element feynman had go at this years ago and he derived according to my limited understanding that above element informally denoted feynmanium the electrons in the nearest orbit about the nucleus would be traveling at velocity greater than the speed of light note am considering the bohr model of the atom in this question wished to demonstrate to my friends why this is and came up with the following explanation according to bohrs quantum condition the angular momentum of an electron about the nucleus is given by evr hslash implies frac hslash ev where is the mass of the electron its velocity an integer and the radius of the th possible orbit because we are concerned with the nearest orbit to the nucleus and thus frac hslash ev now according to coulombs law if the electron orbits about the nucleus the centripetal motion can be described by frac ze pi epsilon or ev where denotes the number of protons in the nucleus the atomic number and the elementary charge solving for and substituting in from above yields frac pi epsilon hslash but what is well the maximum velocity an electron could ever have is the speed of light and we wish to find the atomic number associated with an orbiting electron traveling at this speed so we set and obtain our final result of frac pi epsilon hslash approx which implies that for the electrons at position of in the bohr model would have velocity and thus the highest atomic number achievable on the periodic table is again just want to make sure this is correct method for deriving element before presenting perhaps one could explain how relativity plays role here know feynman used the dirac equation to get this result so could anyone subsequently of course expatiate on this in simplistic manner thanks
228279 while studying about the resonance and forced oscillations came across graph in my textbook that is given below now the author writes as the amount of damping increases the peak shifts to lower frequencies why does this happen and does this imply that at higher damping levels one cannot achieve higher amplitude by setting the period of the forced oscillation to be equal to the natural frequency this seems strange because the highest amplitude is achieved when the natural frequency is equal to the driving frequency but guess that the rules are somehow different for the damping case
228346 from this aviation se answer and personal experience aircraft routinely are held on their brakes while the engines are run up to full power prior to take off intuitively to me at least this is hard to explain given the formidable power of jet engines especially military aircraft why is this possible why doesnt something break or why doesnt the aircraft just skid down the runway wheels locked tyres smoking for instance its not that hard to wheel spin stationary car or vice versa slam on the brakes in moving car and break the adhesion between the tyre and road surface
228401 the hartley transform is defined as omega frac sqrt pi int infty infty ft mbox cas omega mathrm with mbox cas omega cos omega sin omega the fourier transform on the other hand is defined very similar as omega frac sqrt pi int infty infty ft mbox exp omega mathrm with mbox exp omega cos omega sin omega but although the fourier transform requires complex numbers it is used much more in physics than the hartley transform why is that are their any properties that make the fourier transformation more physical or what is the advantage of the fourier transformation over the hartley transformation
228802 would like to briefly know where and why does perturbation theory fail and why are physicists so desperate looking for non perturbative theories no mc its not obvious to me is it not obvious to you that if it were obvious to me wouldnt ask the question
228887 have just finished watching the new star wars movie the force awakens and during the end credits text is shown upon background of stars wearing the 3d glasses noticed that the text appears in the foreground and the stars appear in the background on removing the glasses then noticed that the text is crisp clear and drawn only once on the screen whereas the stars are all drawn twice with constant distance from left to right between the two instances of each star however from my understand of how 3d glasses work objects whose two instances are further apart should appear closer to the eyes and objects whose two instances are close together or at the same location as with the text should appear further away from the eyes so why did experience the opposite effect when watched the credits
229047 audio of shepard tone on youtube so what is shepard tone shepard tone named after roger shepard is sound consisting of superposition of sine waves separated by octaves when played with the base pitch of the tone moving upward or downward it is referred to as the shepard scale this creates the auditory illusion of tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower wikipedia computer simulated shepard tone goes on and on and on it never ends literally we feel our brain perceives that the amplitude or the frequency or whatever is increasing gradually but after some time we feel that that tone is repeating again starting from same point so the frequency of the tone changes periodically like sine wave but why we the human voice cannot produce that tone how hard we try we cannot produce this may be due to exhaustion or the capacity of lungs our voice seems to get saturated after certain limit further which we cannot produce the sound why if the frequency of the tone changes periodically like sine wave we should be able to continue producing the tone from where we started it but no this does not happen why ps my terminology may be wrong so feel free to edit it
229076 if in the future humans genetically engineered themselves to be able to hear frequencies significantly above 20khz say up to 100khz would they find vinyl lps viable method of storing and playing back those frequencies if not what limits the mediums ability to do this edit by medium broadly refer to everything in the pressing and playback mechanism edit am asking about consumer vinyl as currently exists in something you could conceivably buy in shop today
229168 have heard several pseudoscientific explanations about the heisenberg uncertainty principle and find them hard to believe as mathematician mainly focusing on functional analysis have considerable interest in this matter although still have no idea about it aim to truly understand it one day for now the question is can the heisenberg uncertainty principle be explained so that non scientist can at least get correct idea of what it says and what not one of the most heard explanations is the one that says na vely that while trying to determine the position of particle you send energy light so you modify its speed therefore making it impossible to determine the speed if understand well this should only be some sort of metaphor to explain it right
229198 was recently studying pair production and annihilation the author mentions that nearby nucleus is required when the photon materialises into particle and an anti particle the explanation given is that the momentum and the energy must be conserved however there is no calculation given that shows the violation of energy the reason is just blankly stated is there more to this concept please explain as far as know that from the knowledge of particle physics virtual photons can violate the conservation laws if the time scales are very small due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle then why cant we apply the same idea here ps ive read the other answers but none of them include the contribution of nucleus energy momentum to conserve momentum or energy
229464 studying quantum mechanics have suddenly come to the conclusion that pauli matrices are essentially density matrices for spin systems does it make any sense or have missed something
229480 considering that tev is more or less the same kinetic energy as mosquito flying why is it considered to be great amount of energy at the lhc mean giant particle accelerator that can only provide tev of energy in the mass center if understood well is it because particles are so small that this amount of energy in proportions is then really huge
229931 from goldsteins classical mechanics 2nd ed problem of chapter basically says the following its been shown that the poisson bracket of two constants of the motion is also constant of the motion by the jacobi identity applied the angular momentum of particle system this says that if the components of angular momentum and are conserved is also conserved because xl this seems to imply that any system confined to move in plane automatically has its angular momentum conserved since and are identically zero immediately we can think of systems confined to plane where isnt conserved angular momentum of spring on watch or that of plane disk rolling down an incline what objections can be made to this implication does the theorem above require any restrictions cant find any solutions to this online but heres my guess think the problem is that this theorem relies on and being constants of the motion with respect to system certain phase space with underlying hamiltonian described by hamiltons principle and the cited examples where angular momentum wasnt conserved required constraint equations which would alter the form of the lagrangian formalism which the hamiltonian formalism is based on the theorem could then be formulated as follows the poisson bracket of two constants of the motion with respect to system described by the typical hamiltons principle is also constant of the motion by the jacobi identity what do you think is my guess on the right track if so how could it be refined if not why is my guess invalid
230036 is there type of sound within our visual spectrum that we can see with our eyes
230054 the energy of moving object is mv that is it increases with velocity squared walk at say miles per hour or lets round that down to meter per second for slow walk weigh less than mathrm kg but lets just round that up to mathrm kg for convenience it is just after christmas so when walk along the pavement have mathrm kg joules of kinetic energy now get on passenger jet which is cruising at around knots call that meters per second in my seat have times joules of kinetic energy but when walk down the aisle have times joules of kinetic energy the difference between these is joules it feels the same to me walking down the pavement as walking down the aisle of the plane didnt have to make some huge effort to get up to speed on the plane yet needed times the energy to do it how is this possible and where did the energy come from
230227 am wondering what would happen in situation where there is some liquid in closed container is vacuum and is the liquid am also interested if there are any differences in behaviour when the ratio changes
230249 as read somewhere it said that the universe is heading toward disorder entropy increasing now as far as know from the second law of thermodynamics it states that entropy is indeed increasing and in the end the entropy of the universe will be maximum so everything will evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium same temperature everywhere in the universe so my question is isnt equilibrium order why is entropy called measure of disorder if more entropy means more order
230495 as far as understand one requires that in order for the scalar product between two vectors to be invariant under lorentz transformations mu rightarrow mu lambda mu alpha alpha we require that the metric eta mu nu transform as eta mu nu rightarrow eta mu nu lambda alpha mu eta alpha beta lambda beta nu since we require that mu mu alpha alpha rightarrow mu mu eta mu nu mu nu eta mu nu lambda mu alpha lambda nu beta alpha beta alpha alpha eta alpha beta alpha beta what confuses me is that ive been reading up on the cosmological constant problem and in several sets of notes it is claimed that the contribution of the vacuum energy density to the energy momentum tensor should be of the form vac mu nu rho vac mu nu the argument being that the vacuum must be lorentz invariant and the only lorentz invariant tensor is the metric tensor eta mu nu apart from the levi civita tensor density dont see how this is the case by looking at eta mu nu lambda alpha mu eta alpha beta lambda beta nu how is it obvious that this is lorentz invariant shouldnt it be something like eta mu nu eta mu nu apologies if this is stupid question but im just having mental block over it
230685 four legged chairs are by far the most common form of chair however only three legs are necessary to maintain stability whilst sitting on the chair if the chair were to tilt then with both four legged and three legged chair there is only one direction in which the chair can tilt whilst retaining two legs on the ground so why not go for the simpler cheaper three legged chair or how about more robust five legged chair what is so special about the four legged case one suggestion is that the load supported by each leg is lower in four legged chair and so the legs themselves can be weaker and cheaper but then why not or legs another suggestion is that the force to cause tilt is more likely to be directly forwards or sideways with respect to the persons body which would retain two legs on the floor with four legged chair but not three legged chair third suggestion is that four legged chairs just look the best asthetically due to the symmetry finally perhaps it is just simpler to manufacture four legged chair again due to this symmetry or is it just custom that started years ago and never changed
230751 inspired by why are four legged chairs so common ive been wondering for while why do most wheeled office chairs have wheels my guess would be that while stability vs simplicity results in legs adding mobility to the equation may result in the need for wheels edit this question is about mobile chair
230973 that is basically my question it arose when saw an article here is the scientific paper which should be free to read saying two caltech scientists might have found the 9th planet of the solar system
231017 read book in which one chapter gave speech about the fundamental constants of the universe and remember it stated this if the mass of an electron the planck constant the speed of light or the mass of proton were even just slightly different smaller or bigger than what they actually are then the whole universe would not exist as we know it maybe we all wouldnt exist this speech works for all the fundamental known constants of the universe but one the boltzmann constant its value is well known but even if its value were times bigger or if it were exactly or or well the universe would remain the same as it is now the boltzmann constant is not really fundamental to the existence of the universe maybe they werent the exact words but the concept is correct now ask is that true and why
231085 is sound energy useful as source for generating electricity if so could it be renewable resource
231732 was reading the following answer from this question in physics you cannot ask answer why without ambiguity now we observe that the speed of light is finite and that it seems to be the highest speed for the energy effective theories have been built around this limitation and they are consistent since they depend of measuring devices which are based on technology sciences that all have built in in modern sciences one doesnt care of what is happenning but of what the devices measure think this raises good point can we get false positive of theory being right just because the instruments doing the measuring have that theory built in for example if it were the case that there is particle which travels faster than light could we even tell thats the case since some of our methods of measuring distance involve relativity which assumes the speed of light as an upper bound
232028 we know that in wave equation sin omega kx phi displacement of particle on axis assuming transverse wave amplitude omega angular velocity wave number and phi phase difference understand that the everything within the bracket in the equation is an angle but dont understand what is the difference between those terms when do we use omega and kx and phi as much as understand phi is taken into account when we need to find the angle difference between two waves but am really confused between the other two is there even any difference between both of them note read this and this phys se questions but they dont take into account the kx term in their phase
232298 dont know lot about physics but this seemed like the correct place to ask my question apologize in advance if it is ridiculous one its actually two part question if the population of humans and other live forms increases does that add to the overall mass of earth if that is the case could that extra mass ever be enough to change the orbit around the sun
232589 see lot of books lectures about classical field theory making use of complex scalar fields however why complex fields are used in the first place is often not really motivated sometimes one can read as footnote that complex field is in principle mathematically equivalent to two real fields see also what is the difference between complex field and two scalar fields but then the author often goes on using complex field anyway this is confusing because from quantum mechanics one learns that complex quantity is not measurable this is of course not the case in classical field theory where both the real and the imaginary part must be simultaneously measurable quantities heard physically motivated reasons for using complex fields like complex scalar field represents different particles than vector of two real fields but this argument doesnt make sense in classical field theory it is if at all correct only relevant in quantum field theory only complex field can represent charged particles real fields are necessarily neutral complex scalar field is scalar and so it is by definition lorentz invariant vector of two real fields is not lorentz invariant and so one must use complex field but im unsure which of these reasons if any is really valid what is the point of using complex fields in classical field theory
232717 specifically what is happening physically if metal rod experiences torsional vibration googling torsional vibration brings up load of research papers well beyond the level im at cant seem to find out what is actually happening when metal rod undergoes torsional vibration the same question applies to bending vibration although have an idea what that might be think its when the rod physically bends into the shape of standing wave if do an experiment where ultrasound standing waves are generated in copper rod is the resulting vibration torsional bending or as suspect neither

233328 prologue my knowledge in these topics is fairly limited so please feel free to point out the mistakes or the not so clear points and bear with me for the oversimplicity of the language used was recently caught in discussion with bunch of friends regarding the real benefit of using the so called blue light filter apps on our electronic devices particularly when it comes to smartphones for those of you who are unfamiliar with this subject there are several studies that dealt with how blue light affects sleep by tricking the brain into thinking that it is still daytime and therefore blocking secretion of melatonin which in turn induces sleep you can read more here as consequence several applications were created to help reducing this phenomenon the approach is pretty standard shift the color tones of whats displayed to much warmer spectrum so that colors are less blue the still daytime effect on the brain is weaker and the sleep cycle is not disrupted there are two ways of doing that the first one operates at the video driver level directly controlling the color spectrum of what is to be drawn on screen typically shifting it to warmer tone another approach on the other hand overlays trasparently red layer on top of the screen in order to reduce the blue ish colors coming out of the display please note that this is software rendered layer not an actual physical film that is applied to the device so here goes the question do these approaches produce the same effect outcome when it comes to reducing the blue light emission of the display is there some kind of difference that stems from having more control on the video driver rather than simply placing red overlay when looking for an answer please consider these points assume the brightness of the display is set to fixed level in all possible scenarios of comparison if you want some examples take look at lux and twilight
233409 was reading this and it says that microsoft put server farm at the bottom of the ocean because its cooler there particularly it seems to imply that it gets colder as you go deeper since ocean water gets pretty cold toward the sea floor but know that pressure causes heat for example it is responsible for igniting fusion at the center of the sun what gives
233497 know that if something is thrown up with velocity it comes down with the same velocity as long as its motion faces no resistance so is it possible for me to fire bullet and be killed if it drops down on me directly assuming there is no air resistance
233798 in richard rhodes book the making of the atomic bomb was reading about the trinity nuclear test high speed photos were taken and this one is from 1ms after the detonation the book mentions the irregular spikes at the bottom of the image but does not explain them is there specific reason or explanation for these odd spikes in the relatively spherical explosion nuclear explosion photographed less than one millisecond after detonation from the tumbler snapper test series in nevada showing fireball and rope trick effects the fireball is about meters in diameter in this shot
233844 this question has been bothering me for while now can one reconstruct an arbitrary normalizable function phi mathbf in mathbb with only the discrete set of hydrogen wavefunctions or eigenfunctions of the 3d harmonic oscillator or must one include the free states as well there are many sources griffiths others that suggest these are complete basis from which we can construct any non pathological function yet if they are complete how can they be orthogonal to free states ill note there are very similar questions asked elsewhere on physics se here and here one is asking if continuum states must be included in perturbative expansion though its almost always omitted another suggesting that free states are an orthogonal complement somewhere in the comments but there does not appear to be consensus clarification would be appreciated
234018 this question is indeed lengthy but please go through the question at least from the study of kinetic theory know that for intuitive answers we can associate the states liquid solidgas with the motion of their constituent particles that is for example in gas particles can move freely much more than particles in liquids which in turn can move more freely as compared to solids that is if need to convert water to gas need to give it energy to its particle and excite it so that it can break away from the forces of attraction and move much freely but then studied about sublimation and examples of say dry ice which convert directly to gaseous co even at room temperatures but based on this analogy of kinetic theory shouldnt there be state of energy of the particles associated with their movements between the solid gaseous state which we should term as liquid state as how is it possible that particles of dry ice whose movement was restricted very much suddenly turn into gaseous state having very high velocities shouldnt this transition happen continuously rather than suddenly as projected by the term sublimation as most of the particles of solids have arrested movements and only sort of vibrate but in gases it is completely different so why shouldnt we term state between them as liquid as we do in many other processes edit understand that melting boiling point and all that also depends on pressure which gives rise to phenomenon such as regelation but am trying to ask much basic question that is if particles in say dry ice as above have restricted movement and can only vibrate about their position then how can this be suddenly converted to gas in which the particles have very high velocities and can disappear into the air within fraction of air as to me it just sounds like one day am sitting on chair in india and then within fraction of seconds am suddenly on the moon what happened in between why the discontinuity and the same thing is what is troubling me here and that is what am trying to ask here as there must be state between solid gas in which particles have greater velocity then solids but less than gaseous particle state which we commonly call liquid so why not do it this time and say transition between states happened like this solid dry ice particles have very low velocities liquid dry iceparticles can roam much freely gaseous dry iceparticles have gone crazy and are roaming here and there as they wish as very little force of attraction is there but instead of this we use the term sublimation which doesnt tell the whole story so why do we use this term for some substances at some temperatures and for some we do not if we know that the transition is always happening continuously
234120 comparing the equations for the gravitational and electric force vec frac gm 1m and vec frac kq 1q noticed the only major difference between them is that the constant depends on the medium why does it
234304 read http www particleadventure org physicists concluded that in fact the weak and electromagnetic forces have essentially equal strengths this is because the strength of the interaction depends strongly on both the mass of the force carrier and the distance of the interaction the difference between their observed strengths is due to the huge difference in mass between the and particles which are very massive and the photon which has no mass as far as we know so should all books teaching four fundamental forces change to three with third being electroweak or still there are four fundamental forces

234538 am trying to teach myself quantum mechanics and am currently on complex vector space arithmetic according to wikipedia product of bra and ket is scalar which think means complex number but then on the same page it also says that both bras and kets can be represented by 1xn and nx1 matrices respectively the product of to such matrices should be 1x1 matrix not scalar as answered here my questions are can we really represent bras and kets by matrices in multiplication or is this just analogy taken too far if yes can we reliably replace 1x1 matrix by scalar is every situation or is it shortcut applicable only in some contexts if it is not universally applicable where can we do this replacement and why
234734 perhaps speaking of direction of an electron isnt quite correct but does qm indicates kind of way whether all electrons are going clockwise or not of course qm just gives probability where the electrons are but can you emerge whether they are going in some way in the opposite direction of each other
234938 im year old student and study bachelors degree of information technology this is my last year there before applied to this school didnt know remember anything about mathematics or physics but nevertheless got in and after that studied especially physics and mathematics had the best teachers could hope for they made me realize how much love physics and math and now have top grades in both my gpa is is it too late to study physics career wise if not then when is it too late want to study sc or ph degree but id be years old when apply and when would graduate would be years old by the way what are the differences in sc or ph degrees in physics also are there any good tips what to study for the entrance examination maybe some good text books to study have few text books that plan to read and might also check khan academy videos
235019 the rumor spreads that physicists will make their big gravitational wave announcement this thursday am far from being an experimentalist but want to know if there is any chance that the mentioned observations will reveal any experimental evidence for quantum gravity personally feel like this is merely impossible as gravitational waves should propagate in agreement with classical general relativity but might very well not see pitfalls if there are any update by evidence for quantum gravity mean experimental results which dont agree with predictions of general relativity or its classical generalizations they might be coming from string theory or loop gravity or from completely different approach which we havent discovered yet want to understand what are the chances that new physics will show up during the upcoming gravitational wave observations also expect gravitational waves to be in highly coherent state thus making the individual gravitons unobservable is this true
235079 ok this looks like dumb question or even near trolling but really dont understand it when air is heated over an oven plate it rises obviously can check by blowing some smoke in the common explanation is that hot air has less density than cold air and consequently it rises fair enough the hot air will end above the cold air but why is it rising in column with the same argument could deduce and know that its wrong that the cold air above is denser so it will go down pressing the hot air away sideways what additional fact am and the common explanation missing im pretty sure that the tags found are not optimal edit in my mind envision picture of red hot air molecules separated more than the blue cold molecules which slip down between the red ones im aware that this is very crude model and moreover ends in wrong prediction edit about the duplicate im not sure if the other question is about the way in which the hot air raises at least the answers over there do not or not clearly address this aspect the accepted answer here explains what is going on by stating formulas for pressure above the heat plate as well as next to it
235285 congrats to the ligo team on the announcement of their discovery of gravitational waves the articles ive read say that the distortion we see here is much smaller than proton what about at the source would these waves have been strong enough to see macroscopic effects near the binary black holes themselves could you orbit the system at safe distance observe the merger and feel the waves
235413 studied the theoretical part about the gravitational waves in general relativity linearization of gravity and small perturbations of the metric and so on but was wondering about since electromagnetic radiation is composed carried by photons or better the em force shall gravitational waves be composed carried by gravitons in the end do gravitational waves imply the existence of gravitons or its something unrelated and off topic
235450 in feb edition of times of india an article read with the discovery of gravitational waves we will be able to track supernovas hours before theyre visible to any telescope because the waves arrive earth long before any light does giving astronomers time to point telescopes like hubble in that direction see also page of the paper does this mean that gravitational waves reach us before light from source can this be some printing mistake or am interpreting it wrongly edit can there be special cases as explained in some answers where gravitational waves seem to reach before light waves from source though not violating the speed limit
235574 following the measurement of gravitational waves many sources described them and explained they carry energy away what dont get is how this energy will get transfered back to anything else if the fabric of space time itself is vibrating it would seem to be in impossible for any physical object to gain this energy what am missing how would one hypothetically get energy out of gravitational waves if impossible does the universe end up with nothing but gw
236145 the merging black hole binary system gw150914 was detected in only days of aligo data at signal level that appears to be well above the detection threshold at around sigma there are no further events between and sigma in the same data could this event have been detected by previous ligo virgo incarnations which observed for much longer albeit with lower sensitivity if so does this indicate that the aligo team have struck lucky and that this is comparatively rare event that may not be repeated for many years edit the answers have agree that ligo couldnt have seen it but dont yet completely explain why gw150914 had strain that rose from few to over about seconds this appears to make the characteristic strain maybe few hz and thus would appear from the published sensitivity curves to lie above original ligos detection sensitivity at frequencies of sim hz is my estimate of the characteristic strain way off
237268 can someone please answer how dark matter theory resolves eliminates these two possible problems dark matter per my understanding due to gravity keeps moving and due to its non interactive nature does not stick to itself or normal matter therefore it is in continuous and may be somewhat random movement wouldnt this make the speed curve of spiral galaxies pretty unstable or unpredictable dark matter due to gravity keeps moving usually most dense at the center of the galaxy whenever some of it enters the event horizon of the central black hole it should not be able to come out ever again over million billions of years all of it little by little should eventually end up inside the central black hole making it impossible to maintain the uniform speed curve even though it is non interactive is it correct that it still could not escape the event horizon if so how it is still possible to maintain the uniform speed curve of galaxies for billions of years am thinking due to non interactive non sticking nature movement rotation of dark matter should not be uniform and it should be crossing in and out passing the central black hole thereby some of it being consumed for ever once this process starts the central black hole would begin to become heavier making the process even faster also am thinking that to cause uniform speed curve dark matter has to be distributed over the galaxy in certain way all or most of it in the central black hole would not support the uniform speed curve do the dark matter simulations take these two problems into account how they are resolved avoided
237306 if there was source of continuous gravitational wave at say 50hz and amplitude of say micrometer typical sound wave displacement think and you were nearby standing happily on planet in an atmosphere with your ear pointing to the source would you hear it it seems to me that since the gravitational wave is reducing and increasing the distance between points in the atmosphere right at your eardrum surely the density and pressure of the air there is likewise increasing and decreasing so you might expect to hear it what cant intuit is whether you would actually hear it due to the fact that you yourself are also being distorted my tentative conclusion is that you would hear it at any given time there appears to be pressure differential across your eardrum due to this distortion in space pressurising the materials so deflection note know that in the recent ligo announcement they talked about hearing the waves but this is something completely different an electro acoustic rendition of the waveform im asking about direct physical sensing
237497 stone must fly over two walls of height and from the side of the lower wall the distance between the upper points of the two walls near which the stones trajectory lies is find the minimum velocity of the stone source an matveevs mechanics and relativity answer sqrt gh where is acceleration due to gravity the rather terse nature of the problem statement is very typical of russian texts im an intermediate advanced self learner and love to wrangle with these kinds of problems this problem seemed like basic projectile motion problem but this has got me in knots if the limiting height is why does the problem need and there is no angle to use either whats the significance of the requirement for minimum velocity clearly it has to cross the walls and based on what see likely lies below the trajectory and must just touch the trajectory and this can potentially give the velocity but im unable to find the approach to solve this can anyone provide way to think about this problem
237588 imagine that you are falling into object with huge gravity black hole that does not have any atmosphere the question is before you hit the ground can the gravity itself which would be extremely huge kill you and if so how exactly that could be done all parts of your body are affected same and in the same direction therefore it cant tear you apart the zero gravity is simulated on earth with falling plane with speed increasing by gravitational acceleration but is it real zero gravity or is it little different
237612 from my laymans perspective it feels like the many worlds interpretation is invoked out of the inability to explain why one observation occurs out of many possibilities given no explanation why one particular observation occurs out of many we say all events took place so theres no need to explain why particular event happened anymore to me it looks like this doesnt fix anything just sweeps it under the rug theres still the question why did observe this particular event when could have observed multiple others ie why am in this world instead of another so the need to explain the specificity of our experience is still there if there are multiple versions of me the question still exists why am this version is my impression false is there more to the many worlds interpretation than im thinking
238782 couldnt find any publication by ligo that explains how we should interpret this value the closest have found is the following quote this means that noise event mimicking gw150914 would be exceedingly rare indeed we expect an event as strong as gw150914 to appear by chance only once in about years of such data this false alarm rate can be translated into number of sigma denoted by which is commonly used in statistical analysis to measure the significance of detection claim this search identifies gw150914 as real event with significance of more than sigma http www ligo org science publication gw150914 index php from my reading it appears that sigma significance refers to the probability of observing such signal given that the model of background noise correctly describes all input to the detectors at the time of the signal would like to verify that the above interpretation is correct and is different from the probability gw150914 arose due to chance was caused by gravitational wave was caused by bh bh merger ask because have seen posts on this site and elsewhere both news and blogs that seem to imply differently worry may be misunderstanding some terminology specific to astrophysics also does anyone know what calculations were used to convert false alarm rate to of sigmas this detail seems to have been left out of the papers so assume it is something trivial am missing due to lack of background in this area edit let me clarify what have learned is an incorrect interpretation above this is bayes rule ph frac phpo po tag where text hypothesis model of background noise describes text all input to the detectors at the time of the signal text observation the gw150914 signal just to be clear ph text the probability is true given has been observed po text the probability of observing given is true ph text the probability is true textit independent text of observation po text the probability of observing textit independent text of whether is true the last term can be rewritten as po phpo neg hpo neg tag where the probability is false is denoted by neg ph tag in the answers we established the sigma level is simple transformation of the value which equals po it is clear that ph must have different numerical value than the value except under some very specific circumstances when ph po the value is calculated under the assumption that is true and from equations we see that ph explicitly depends on both ph and the probability of observing such signal if is false po neg if our hypothesis is true think we all agree the only way to get signal like gw150914 is chance coincidence of noise patterns between the two ligo detectors so when writing we often use shorthand such as text any signal is due to caused by chance coincidence or text any signal is not real there are many shorthand ways of saying the same thing that confuses things the point is that the value is not the probability gw150914 was caused by arose from is due to chance background noise random coincidence it is also not the probability gw150914 isnt real or how unlikely it is that gw150914 is due to chance in this case the value is apparently po approx2 times10 also apparently the only other plausible explanation is bh bh merger in an earlier question we estimated the prior probability of this to be approx10 text to if we suppose that is the only other possible explanation that must be the probability that is false independent of observing gw150914 neg first lets use the lower bound neg approx10 from equation then ph approx0 also gw150914 apparently matched prediction exactly therefore probability of seeing such signal given that is false is po neg approx1 plugging in these values we get ph frac times2 times10 times2 times10 times1 approx0 doing the same for the upper bound get ph approx times10 now we can say the probability gw150914 occurred due to chance ranges from times10 text to times10 which is quite different from the value any mistakes in this reasoning
238893 can someone intuitively explain how physically time dilation happens please dont explain about the invariant speed of light and the mathematical background am familiar with that just cant imagine how this time dilation process is happening physically and cant understand how to distort my mind to understand it sorry for this question it probably sounds like why there are positive and negative charges but have to ask what could make the question clear is the equivalent one how could be that the two moving observers do not agree on the simultaneity of events and one sees the other in slow motion but he also knows that the other see him in slow motion how to imagine the reason of this time dilation probably something similar to banding of space leading to contracting lengths but for the time it would have been more clear if the time difference was unsymmetrical and if observer sees me in slow motion then should see him in faster motion so ok agree that my time has being delayed and he agree that too but this is not the case
239218 im having trouble understanding why this machine doesnt work part of ring half of which is uniformly charged is located between two oppositely charged plates attracting to the negative one and pushing away from the positive one thus gaining angular momentum understand that perpetuum mobile is impossible however im interested why in terms of electrostatics and mechanics this machine cant accelerate infinitely
239250 according to quantum mechanics in order for an atom to absorb photon the energy of the photon must be precisely that of jump between energy states of the atom how precise must it be if create photon with an energy within an error of of that of an energy state will it be absorbed by my atom
240106 well am quite new to concepts of vocal sounds from the physics point of view believe sound has two basic parameters frequency and amplitude considering the end sound wave produced by human voice it must have frequency and amplitude as parameters well when human can speak in multiple frequencies multiple pitches and amplitudes multiple volumes was wondering what makes every human voice unique even if two persons produce sustained notesay same music note their voices can be easily distinguished so why do the voices seem different are there any others parameters that distinguishes or do have misconception
241043 intro to avoid any terminology confusion this is asked in the context of solid state physics and semiconductors the canonical definition given for the effective mass is that it is related to the curvature of the conduction and valence bands in the band structure energy dispersion in terms of vector for electrons and holes respectively so eff is given by eff hbar frac partial partial tag moreover for the holes one often has to distinguish between light and heavy ones as the band structure may contain multiple valence bands with different curvatures effective masses are usually tabulated in terms of free electron masses for silicon we know that the heavy holes have the mass of the free electron and light holes question im just curious to learn how experimentally for given material gaas ge one goes about measuring the effective masses what are the most usually adopted methods it would be enlightening to learn about the key ideas behind such experimental procedures are there both direct and indirect ways of measuring eff indirect in the sense that we measure other observables from which we may be able to infer reliably what the effective masses ought to be and direct in the sense that an experiment designated solely to measure eff if useful account of ideas involved is difficult to implement in such platform feel free to refer to relevant literature where solid exposure is given
241050 last night my daughter was asking why mirror always does that referring to reflecting spot of light to help her figure it out grabbed my green laser pointer so she could see the light traveling from the source and reflecting off the mirror but as we were playing noticed something strange rather than one spot there were several when adjusted the angle to something fairly obtuse the effect became quite pronounced and when you looked closely you could actually see several beams of course the beams actually looked like beams in real life the picture gives the beams an elongated hourglass shape because those parts are out of focus made these observations the shallower the angle the greater the spread of the split beams and resulting dots the directionality of the reflection is due to the orientation of the mirror not the laser pointer itself indeed by rotating the mirror the string of dots would make full rotation as well can count at least individual dots on the wall but could only see beams with the naked eye if you look at the split beam picture you can see vertical line above the most intense dots didnt observe any intense spots of light there and when looked closely at the spot where the beam hit the mirror you can see double image this was not due to camera shake just the light reflecting off the dust on the surface of the glass and reflection of that light from the rear surface of the mirror its been few years since college physics remembered doing things like the double split experiment also remembered that light seems like it does some strange things when it enters liquid prisms also know that the green laser has certain wavelength and you can measure the speed of light with chocolate bar and microwave why does the mirror split the laser beam how does that explain the effects that saw is there any relation to the double split experiment or the wavelength speed of light
241355 for instance suppose it is alloy of two metals that is bcc at room temperature if raise or lower the temperature is it possible for the bonds in the crystal to rearrange and form new structure say fcc that is more energetically favourable at the new saw question on an engineering forum here that seemed to suggest the only thing that affected the structure was the composition of the alloy could temperature play role too
241896 in quantum field theory and particle physics we use feynman diagrams but in schwartzs textbook and here it is shown that it applies to more general cases like general perturbation theory for differential equations can feynman diagrams be used to represent any perturbation theory my thoughts are that we might be able to use this for perturbation theory in coupled equation systems like we get in fluid dynamics or astrophysics but is it still possible to write down feynman rules as pictorial representation and if it still does work in this case are there cases where that exhibit different algebraic structure that feynman rules can not represent note that this is not question about perturbation theory in quantum field theory since there the use of feynman diagrams is well known but in more general context if the answer to the question is simply no could one at least give classes perturbation theories that it applies to
241943 tomato is travelling very fast towards cm thick steel plate lets say this happened in vacuum so that the air resistance wouldnt rip the tomato apart before it even hit the steel plate obviously the tomato would get destroyed too but the question is whether there would be hole in the steel plate given enough speed guess more general way to phrase the question is can soft object create hole through hard surface as long as the soft object is traveling fast enough if yes is there limit to this concept for example could the tomato even penetrate wall made of diamond as long as it was traveling fast enough edit comment on one of the answers used this video to show that tomatoes cant exist for very long in vacuum if this is correct the situation needs to be that the tomato is stationary the plate moves and the tomato is put into the vacuum shortly before impact believe the impact scenario would be the same in that case
242059 if im not mistaken schr dinger was influenced to look at wave equations because of de broglies assertion about particles having wavelength he started with the hamiltonian equation which is related to principle of least action what dont get is how he ended up with an equation that describes probability distribution maybe have poor understanding of the equation but starting with deterministic function relating to principle of least action and ending up with probability function seems to be like trying to model the orbit of the moon and ending up with an equation that accurately models the mating pattern of monarch butterflies what mean by this is that the evolution of the hamiltonian and lagrangian equations from the principle of least action then everything from newtonian mechanics to relativity from those equations seems like very neat and traceable path going from wave equation to probability density seems to have logical gap at least in my mind so my question is what is the intuitive connection if any that clarifies justifies how this leap is made
242068 in arfkens mathematical methods for physicists there is subsection of the infinite series chapter which covers the bernoulli numbers euler mascheroni integration or summation and the connection these have with the riemann zeta function however apart from few nifty math problems these solve explicit expressions for some sums and integrals cant see the use of these concepts in physics there were few problems at the end of the chapter that said that some practice integrals showed up in qed corrections so thats start would like to know where else these ideas show up in physics if they do
242086 if you would be real seeker after truth it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt as far as possible all things rene descartes laymen like me typically refers to wikipedia for basic definitions in physics spacetime is any mathematical model that combines space and time into single interwoven continuum http en wikipedia org wiki spacetime gravitational waves are radiant energy produced in certain gravitational interactions they are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as waves travelling outward from the source http en wikipedia org wiki gravitational wave effects of passing and from the same source as gravitational wave passes an observer that observer will find spacetime distorted by the effects of strain distances between objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave passes at frequency corresponding to that of the wave why it is assumed above that it is particular distance component in its three dimensional space sense of the spacetime continuum and not the time component of the spacetime continuum which is changing under the effect of gravitational wave passage let me push my questions logic further in very non orthodox and ignorant manner and also ask playing the role of devils advocate while risking to be accused in lack of confidence in basic concepts of general relativity why one can not interprete the measurement results during ligo detection as manifest of speed of light variations versus considering the speed of light being absolutely invariant under any possible circumstances such as the case of gravitational wave passage
242499 couldnt help but notice that the expression for the magnetic component of the lorentz force mathbf mathbf times mathbf is very similar in its mathematical form to the coriolis force mathbf 2m mathbf times mathbf providing that we replace electric charge with mass and angular velocity with the magnetic induction even though am aware of the physical differences between those two forces coriolis is fictitious force which acts on objects that are in motion relative to rotating frame of reference whereas the magnetic force is caused by magnetic field do remember reading that magnetism is relativistic effect of electricity feynman lectures and wonder whether this analogy is pure coincidence or could obey to deeper connection could it have something to do with lorentz transformations on more general level could the magnetic force be viewed as fictitious and may this have some relation with the apparent non existence of magnetic monopoles edit would like to point out that the analogy can be extended to the two other inertial forces the centrifugal force and the euler force as is shown here and here my question could then be restated as why is there an analogy between inertial and electromagnetic forces
242665 so was told today that the standard model breaks down at really really high energies the lecturer mentioned particles such as electrons hypothetically having energies equivalent to that of entire stars and it got me thinking surely the maximum theoretical energy any particle can have is limited by the speed of light understand im talking about only kinetic energy here but fail to see how any other form of energy is relevant at those sorts of speeds did wonder if massive particles at the speed of light have infinite energy which satisfies my question if this is the case but dont see that sort of behaviour from einsteins relativistic mass energy relation so my question is is there maximum theoretical energy particles can have
242688 yesterday in rather intuitive session by visiting researcher in my town this question got my attention what he said was that if you boil an egg the entropy inside the egg would increase now common convention and logic dictates that the entropy will decreaseconsidering only the innards of the egg in the system but this guy would not give up he insisted on the contraryand has given us time to think it out dont know which se site to referer to for this question any migration of this question if necessary would be helpful thanks

243565 when im in dark environment and turn on torch can see the beam of light from the torch to the best of my understanding the main reason why can see the beam of light is that the light from the torch scatters off dust and other miscellaneous particles in random directions allowing us to actually see the beam of light if this were the case then would expect the beam of light to decrease with intensity as it travels further from the torch and the beam would sort of smoothly fade out of existence however recently at lights festival held in australia noticed something quite strange instead of smoothly fading out of existence the beams of light at the festival continued into the night sky for set distance and were abruptly cut off the image on the left is just random image showing the beams of light the bright white lights were think moths and other insects as can be seen on the image on the right the beams of light were abruptly cut off after set distance instead of fading out of existence smoothly the effect didnt come out that great on the picture but in real life it was incredibly pronounced most times can always come up with some explanation for phenomenon observe but this time round legitimately have no idea for time thought maybe it was due to human perception the way we perceive light but dont think that it can explain the effect it was just that pronounced
243775 for an oscillating string that is clamped at both ends am thinking of guitar string specifically there will be standing wave with specific nodes and anti nodes at defined positions understand and can work through the maths to obtain the fact that the frequency is quantised and is inversely dependent on the length of the string and some integer if pluck guitar string this oscillates at the fundamental frequency if change to different fret am changing and this is changing the frequency is it possible to get to higher modes etc dont understand how by plucking string you could get to 1st or 2nd overtones are you just stuck in the mode or would the string needed to be oscillated plucked faster and faster to reach these modes
243946 am familiar with some of the definitions of crystal momentum and am familiar with how it is related to blochs theorem also am familiar that crystal momentum is not the momentum of each electron however does crystal momentum have physical meaning is it an observable quantity whose momentum is it electrons phonons or something else
244158 would really like to give an explanation similar to this one heres my current recipe mine uranium for example take rock from here picture of uranium mine in kazakhstan ii put the rock in water then the water gets hot iii efficient way to explain that now we are done with the question this seems wrong or the uranium mine would explode whenever there is rainfall does one need to modify the rock first do need some neutron source other than the rock itself to get the reaction started as soon as have concrete and correct description of how one actually does think can fill in with details about chain reactions et if the child would still be interested to know more

244885 was reading about how the plancks constant can be measured with leds which made me think about this question the heisenberg uncertainty principle states that delta delta ge hbar over2 there is always some uncertainty while measuring things this is fundamental law nothing escapes it as far as know now when we are attempting to measure the plancks constant wouldnt there be some uncertainty this should mean that can never be able to measure the plancks constant to full accuracy ever but if the amount of uncertainty depends on hbar which is uncertain doesnt this lead to uncertainty of uncertainty note im not physicist just physics enthusiast try not to get too technical please
244922 moonlight has color temperature of 4100k while sunlight has higher color temperature of more than 5000k but objects illuminated by moonlight dont look yellower to the eye they look bluer this holds for indoor scenes like my hall and for outdoor find it counter intuitive that moonlight has lower color temperature thought the sun is the yellowest natural source of light we have is that because of the poor color sensitivity of the eye in dim light in other words moonlight is actually yellower but our eyes cant see the intense yellow color if one were to use giant lens to concentrate moonlight to reach the brightness of sunlight will objects illuminated by this light appear yellower to the eye than the same objects under sunlight has anyone done such an experiment looked but couldnt find any alternatively if take long exposure photo of landscape illuminated by the full moon and another one illuminated by sunlight and equalise the white balance and the exposure will the moonlit photo look yellower
244972 in the feynman lectures chapter find the statement we have solved maxwells equations given the currents and charges in any circumstance we can find the potentials directly from these integrals and then differentiate and get the fields in purcells book on electricty and magnetism find the statement except for the possible addition of constant field pervading all of space the conditions curl bf pi bf and div bf uniquely determine the magnetic field of given distribution of currents dont have griffithss textbook in front of me at the moment but im pretty sure he says something similar clearly all of these statements are false for example if the current and charge distributions are identically zero then can solve maxwells equations by setting bf gradf and bf gradg where and are arbitrary harmonic functions so that in particular bf and bf are by no means unique even up to the addition of constant vector field presumably then there is some hypothesis that feynman purcell and others have omitted possibly because they thought it was too obvious to mention what is that hypothesis

245215 to recover classical electromagnetic fields from the quantum electromagnetic field we consider coherent states of the form exp left int vec vec vec vec dagger vec right rangle as described in this blog post this state corresponds to classical em field with the vector potential vec vec containing an indeterminate number of photons im confused about how this works for spin fields such as the electron for some reason the classical limit of the electron quantum field that we care about is particle not field so it looks like this procedure does not apply even if we did it have no idea what classical electron field would look like since we never talk about such thing if apply the procedure anyway to get electron coherent states what is the interpretation of these states they have indeterminate electron number which is strange whats the resulting classical electron field like how can we recover quantum electron particles from the quantum electron field
245223 from the figure we know that net mg sin theta now this force vec net is in the direction of the velocity vec of the bob both are tangent to the path therefore the net acceleration vec net has no component perpendicular to the path that is along the length read that if acceleration is in the direction of velocity then body must be moving in straight line but such is not the case why also the bob is moving in circular path and it should be experiencing centripetal force what might be providing that force the tension in the string is cancelled by the component of gravity parallel to the string

245692 langevin equation provides an example of physical model which involves differential equation with stochastic term now wonder how should one treat this when studied stochastic processes learned about it and stratonovich calculus back then just saw these things as technical tools devised to define the stochastic integral in meningful way yes depending on which one you use you would obtain some results or some others but this didnt bother me since was looking at these objects as mere mathematical structures but when faced to the langevin equation wonder how does one make meaningful interpretation of it both it and stratonovich calculus seem like reasonable alternatives but dont find any strong argument to prefer one over the other the point is there must be way to decide which type of stochastic calculus we should use two different definitions of the stochastic integral will lead to contradictory physics law which is troublesome believe that the fokker planck equation can be derived from the langevin equation via it formula but dont think theres any way to achieve this using stratonovichs calculus but of course this would be poor ad hoc argument in favor of it calculus so this is clearly unsatisfactory suming up how would you proceed to find out which version of the stochastic integral is more convenient to deal with stochastic equations in physics is there any physical assumption which makes it calculus more reasonable note of course there is whole parametric family of possible interpolating calculus between both it and stratonovich but believe these two are the only ones that are relevant one of them gives rise to the martingale property and the other one preserves the classical integration by parts rule
245898 my question is concerning wikipedia article on oh my god particle to be precise this paragraph this particle had so much kinetic energy it was travelling at the speed of light this is so near the speed of light that if photon were travelling with the particle it would take years for the photon to gain centimeter lead also due to special relativity effects from the protons reference frame it would have only taken it around seconds to travel the light years across the milky way galaxy would like to see demonstration how the special relativity effect allows the particle to travel the distance in seconds edit thanks for all responses have one more question you all explain the situation from the proton reference frame what about from observer reference frame we can imagine the observer and also the whole universe around moving at the speed of light comparing to the stationary proton how will the proton look from this reference frame edit2 this was not homework just weekend curiosity while reading wikipedia
246050 at the start of the martian movie the astronauts collect samples targeting for grams hence the question what units do astronauts actually use did some quick google search but all get is either how astronauts weigh themselves in zero gravity or how planet weight is calculated think they could use either earth kilograms adjusted to mars gravity yielding different number but same mass or would the same number with mars gravity yielding different mass on each planet either find this confusing and expect they have more elegant solution
246208 was thinking if it may be possible to implement category theory in general relativity dont mean writing simply in terms of categories but actual fundamental ideas physics of the theory itself for example prof john baez has written pretty neat paper on the categorification of yang mills theory also is there way or any recent developments to get this ir limit of general relativity from the least input symmetries and propagating degrees of freedom via category theory if not this is worth thinking about imo
246342 have doubt on the formulation of newton third law when one body exerts force on second body the second body simultaneously exerts force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body on some textbooks find that it follows from the law that the two forces have the same line of action what does this mean exactly in particular does it imply the collinearity of the two forces the fact that the two forces acts on the very same line or two forces acting on two different but parallel lines still satisfy the law
246808 my professor asked an interesting question at the end of the last class but cant figure out the answer the question is this recalled from memory there are two travelling wave pulses moving in opposite directions along rope with equal and opposite amplitudes then when the two wave pulses meet they destructively interfere and for that instant the rope is flat why do the waves continue after that point heres picture found that illustrates the scenario know its got to have something to do with the conservation laws but havent been able to reason it out so from what understand waves propogate because the front of the wave is pulling the part of the rope in front of it upward and the back of the wave is pulling downward and the net effect is pulse that propogates forward in the rope is that right but then to me that means that if the rope is ever flat then nothing is pulling on anything else so the wave shouldnt start up again from conservation perspective guess theres excess energy in the system and thats what keeps the waves moving but then wheres that extra energy when the waves cancel out is it just converted to some sort of potential energy this question is really vexing

247106 is newton second law covariant or invariant between two inertial frames moving with uniform traslational motion with respect to each other if it is invariant then indipendently from the frame vec vec and vec vec of course and this means that vec vec has exactly the same form in both the frames im totally ok with vec vec but how to be sure that vec vec without using the fact that vec vec moreover is this true if the two frames are are oriented differently but the orientation is constant as showed in the picture

250304 the time independent schr dinger equation frac hbar 2m frac psi dx psi psi is second order so we should expect the solution to have two degrees of freedom which can be fixed by specifying boundary conditions however in at least some cases imposing the wavefunction normalization requirement determines those conditions for example the infinite square well potential has general solution sinkx coskx the constant is determined by the width of the well so we get to pick two values and as expected however continuity requires that and the normalization requirement ends up fixing the value of the quantum harmonic oscillator ends up similarly the general solution has term that goes like ae and another that goes like be but the normalization requirement forces to and ultimately determines my questions what physical interpretation can we assign to the choice of boundary conditions for the time independent schr dinger equation is there anything like the initial position and velocity interpretation for newtons second law under what circumstances does imposing the wavefunction normalization requirement determine the boundary conditions
250363 am myopic dont really know if this is relevant or not and usually swim without contact lenses my vision is clearly better underwater when am using swimming goggles have tried to understand why this happens and think that it is probably due to the presence of just air which should be more or less still between the googles and my eyes avoiding this way the turbulent flow of water that should somehow affect my vision due to the fact that air has different refraction index than the one of water and that the material of the goggles is not relevant but it also could be that the material of the goggles is making the difference what is the actual physical explanation of this fact

251803 from my humble physicist mathematics training have vague notion of what hilbert space actually is mathematically an inner product space that is complete with completeness in this sense heuristically meaning that all possible sequences of elements within this space have well defined limit that is itself an element of this space think this is right this is useful property as it enables one to do calculus in this space now in quantum mechanics hilbert spaces play an important role in that they are the spaces in which the pure states of quantum mechanical systems live given set of orthonormal basis vectors lbrace lvert phi rangle rbrace for such hilbert space one can express given state vector lvert psi rangle as linear combination of these basis states lvert psi rangle sum lvert phi rangle since the basis states are orthonormal langle phi lvert phi rangle delta nm we find that langle phi lvert psi rangle and hence lvert psi rangle sum lvert phi rangle sum langle phi lvert psi rangle lvert phi rangle left sum lvert phi rangle langle phi lvert right lvert psi rangle which implies that sum lvert phi rangle langle phi lvert mathbf this is referred to as completeness relation but im unsure what this is referring to ive also read that the basis must be complete is this referring to the notion of completeness associated with limits of sequences or is there something else im missing

252044 the schwarzschild metric is ds left frac 2gm right dt left1 frac 2gm right dr omega in all gr books it is stated that is the mass of the black hole the proof is that in weak gravitational field tt phi where phi is the gravitational potential and in spherical coordinates the potential of point mass of mass is phi frac gm comparing these expressions we find dont buy this argument in the last equation is the radial spherical coordinate in the schwarzschild metric is simply the name of one of the coordinates could have applied some coordinate transformation like substituting 2r and gotten different answer one can argue that the schwarzschild is naturally the radial coordinate because it makes the areas of spheres behave like in regular spherical coordinates ds contains omega but could have chosen another coordinate bar that made radial distances work regularly ds would contain bar both of these feel like radial coordinate to me what allows us to identify the schwarzschild with the spherical radial coordinate is there another way to conclude the schwarzschild solution has mass

252145 this is question for experimentalists have seen in several atlas papers see for example chapter in arxiv 6th paragraph that after objects have been correctly identified any jet close enough to candidate electron is removed from the event the reason seems to be that real electrons can fake jet so they simply remove all jets within delta from the electron in order to avoid double counting and maybe loosing the electron after imposing isolation requirement my question is how can an electron fake jet am not an experimentalist and for me the detector environment looks something like this an electron is one track in the tracker that then becomes smeared blob in the ecal on the other hand jets are bundle of nearby tracks if charged in the silicon tracker followed by blob in the ecal and bigger blob in the hcal so how can an electron be mistaken for jet if they are near by the other way around makes more sense to me an electron faked by jet can electrons puncture into the hcal
252213 abstract the definition of the propagator deltax in the path integral formalism pi is different from the definition in the operator formalism of in general the definitions agree but it is easy to write down theories where they do not in those cases are the pi and of actually inequivalent or is it reasonable to expect that the matrices of both theories agree for definiteness ill consider real scalar field phi with action int mathrm dx frac partial phi frac phi tag path integral formalism in pi we insert source term into the action int mathrm dx phix jx tag the mixed term phi can be simplified with the usual trick by suitable change of variables the action can be written as two independent terms int mathrm dx mathrm dy jx delta mathrm pi yjy tag and this relation defines delta mathrm pi to get the action into this form we have to solve partial delta mathrm pi deltax in pi the propagator is defined as the green function of the euler lagrange equations of this definition is motivated by the the fact that when is written as the partition function can be factored as exp left int mathrm dx mathrm dy jx delta mathrm pi yjy right tag which makes functional derivatives trivial to compute for example if we differente two times we get langle0 mathrm phix phiy rangle delta mathrm pi tag in this formalism the propagator is always the green function of the differential operator of the theory operator formalism in of the propagator is defined as the contraction of two fields delta mathrm of equiv overline phix phi equiv begin cases phi phi phi phi end cases tag where phi pm are the positive and negative frequency parts of phi in general delta mathrm of is an operator but if it commutes with everything or more precisely if the propagator is in the centre of the operator algebra we can prove wicks theorem which in turns means that langle mathrm phix phiy rangle delta mathrm of tag the propagator coincides with the two point function this makes it very easy to see for example that delta mathrm of delta mathrm pi tag in this theory the fact that the propagator is green function is corollary and not definition the theorem may fail if the assumptions are not satisfied the discrepancy the positive negative frequency parts of phi are the creation and annihilation operators which in of usually satisfy phi phi propto deltax cdot1 mathcal tag and therefore overline phix phi is number this means that the assumptions of wicks theorem are satisfied and holds the relation can be derived from one of the basic assumptions of of the canonical commutation relations phix piy deltax cdot1 mathcal tag but if we use any non trivial operator in the of instead of mathcal wicks theorem is violated and in general delta mathrm pi neq delta mathrm of one could argue that the of is fixed by the dirac prescription cdot cdot mathrm to frac hbar cdot cdot where cdot cdot mathrm is the dirac bracket in the standard model its easy to prove that cdot cdot mathrm is always proportional to the identity but in more general theory we may have complex constraints which would make the dirac bracket non trivial read not proportional to the identity and therefore delta mathrm of neq delta mathrm pi scalar spinor and vector qfts always satisfy relation similar to and therefore of and pi formalisms agree but in principle it is possible to study more general qfts where we use commutation relation more complex than dont know of any practical use of this but to me it seems to me that we can have perfectly consistent theory where pi and of formalisms predict different results is this correct hope someone can shed any light on this edit think it can be useful to add some details to what said about dirac brackets defined as ab mathrm db ab mathrm pb ell mathrm pb ij ell jb mathrm pb tag where ell are the constraints and ij ell ell mathrm pb as qp mathrm pb deltax the only way to get non trivial dirac brackets is through the second term this may happen if we have non linear constrains such that the second term is function of pq if in some case we have non linear constrains the matrix will depend on pq and pq mathrm db will be function of pq if we translate this into operators we shall find pi phi deltax cdot1 mathcal pi phi tag and so pi phi wont commute with neither pi nor phi as required by wicks theorem this term is perhaps related to the hbar terms in qmechanics answer and the higher order terms in the moyal bracket
252288 know mathematically the answer to this question is yes and its very obvious to see that the dimensions of ratio cancel out leaving behind mathematically dimensionless quantity however ive been writing dimensional analysis library the specifics of which are out of scope which has me thinking about the problem because decided to handle angle units as dimensioned quantities which seemed natural to enable the unit conversion with degrees the overall purpose of the library is to disallow operations that dont make sense because they violate the rules of dimensional analysis adding length quantity to an area quantity and thus provide some built in sanity checking to the computation treating radians as units made sense because of some of the properties that dimensioned quantities seemed to me to have the sum and difference of two quantities with the same dimension has the same physical meaning as both quantities separately quantities with the same dimension are meaningfully comparable to each other and not meaningfully comparable directly to quantities with different dimensions dimensions may have different units which are scalar multiple of each other sometimes with datum shift if angle is treated as dimension my made up properties are satisfied and everything makes sense to me cant help thinking that the fact that radians are ratio of lengths si defines them as is actually critically important even though the length is cancelled out for example though radians and steradians are both dimensionless it would be logical error to take their sum also cant see how ratio of something like kg kg could be described as an angle this seems to imply to me that not all dimensionless units are compatible which seems analogous to how units with different dimensions are not compatible and if not all dimensionless units are compatible then the dimensionless dimension would violate made up property and cause me lot of confusion however treating radians as having dimension also has lot of issues because now your trig functions have to be written in terms of cosangleunit dimensionlessunit even though they are analytic functions although im not convinced thats bad small angle assumptions in this scheme would be defined as performing implicit unit conversions which is logical given our trig function definitions but incompatible with how many functions are defined especially since many authors neglect to mention they are making those assumptions so guess my question is are all dimensionless quantities but specifically angle quantities really compatible with all other dimensionless quantities and if not dont they actually have dimension or at least the properties of dimension

253098 so have my exams in physics in week and upon reviewing was confused by the explanation of de broglie wavelength of electrons in my book firstly they stated that the equation was lambda frac where is the planck constant and is the momentum of the particle later however when talking about electron diffraction and finding the angles of the minima the author gave the formula equivalent to that for light lambda frac hc now what dont understand is if it is simply mistake made by the author or whether different formula have to be used for electron diffraction as the two formulae are very clearly not equivalent in the latter case dont understand why the formula would be different greatly appreciate the help as the exams are really close and would like to make sure get this right edit was told that pictures of text are taking away from the readability of the posts and thus they were removed essentially the difference between the two cases are that in the first case the proton did not have any significantly large kinetic energy while in the second example the kinetic energy was mev
253415 one of the postulates of qm states that given system in state psi rangle and given an observable whose eigenstates are phi rangle then the state of the system can be expressed as linear combination of them such that psi rangle sum ic phi rangle and the probability of the eigenvalue associated to the eigenstate phi rangle of coming out when is measured is determined by so far so good my question is how are the coefficients determined mean if one can only get eigenvalues when doing measurements and on top of that the system is left on an eigenstate right after that how can one know the state in which the system is before performing the measurement and with that the probability of getting the different eigenvalues

253543 does the inverse square law begin to take effect the moment light leaves its source for example does lights intensity decrease does the area in which the photons might land increase at few millimeters from the source happened to come across an article about emergency lights and photometry from few decades ago that appears to answer in the negative the minimum test distance in photometry of these sources is called the minimum inverse square distance the illumination from the light source measured at distances greater than this minimum obeys the inverse square law which is necessary criterion for the determination of luminous intensity the minimum inverse square distance is determined by the type and size of the light source lens reflector etc and must be considered individually for each unit if this distance is more than meters approximately feet ranger larger than meters must be used source howett et al emergency vehicle warning lights state of the art usdc nbs special publication

254085 consider typical optical focusing system small light source then collimating lens then focussing lens and then detector ccd assume that source intensity is so low that only one photon enter collimating lens per second todays modern technology is able to produce single photon light sources assume that the dark room in which the experiment is done is dark detector detects only the photons coming from the source photon that originated from the source is detected by the ccd is the detected photon the same as the one which originated from source between source and detector there are two lenses when the photon enters the first collimating lens it will interact with the electrons inside the molecules of the material from which the lens is made but it will not interact with nuclei of different elements present in the molecules is the photon that came out of this collimating lens the same as the photon which entered the collimating lens what is the reason that the photon falling on the edge of the focussing lens gets deviated by some angle gets focussed and falls on the detector

255976 im confused about energy driven by wave consider sinousoidal wave moving in rope in my view each element dm of the rope follows simple harmonic motion in time that means that the mechanical energy de dk du of the single element dm is constant nevertheless on halliday resnik krane found this explanation despite the analogies with simple harmonic motion the mechanical energy of the element dm is not constant thats not surprising since the element dm is not an isolated system and its motion is the result of the action of the rest of the rope on it really do not understand how this can be possible similar doubt is for the energy density per unit length to sum up found two cotrasting description of the energy and the energy density in mechanical wave on rope this is the one im ok with the mechanical energy of the single element dm of the rope is constant and equal to de frac dm max from here the linear energy density defined as frac de dx frac mu omega is constant hallyday resnik krane the mechanical energy of the single element of the rope is de frac dm frac partial xi partial frac frac partial xi partial dx is the tension of the rope the mechanical energy of the element of mass dm is not constant since the element is not isolated from the rest of the rope from here the linear energy density is not constant either and its expression is frac de dx which of these two is the correct one and why in the description im ok with the expression of the mechanical energy but do not agree with the fact that de and are not constant is the mechanical energy of dm really not constant if so what can be an explanation for that is this somehow related to the fact that the energy of wave is not concentrated in single point but somehow spread in all the rope continuously any suggestion on this topic is really appreciated
256008 do not understand why standing sound waves can be formed in one side or two side open tube consider one side open tube in particular how does the reflection of the wave at the open end occur found the following explanation the sound wave is pressure wave and at the open end of the tube the pressure must be fixed to the atmosferic pressure and cannot vary thus there is node of pressure there do not get why the pressure at the open end cannot vary from the atmospheric pressure furthermore if the outside pressure does not change the sound wave pressure wave is somehow trapped in the tube and do not exit from it nevertheless for example in clarinet the sound wave do exit and propagate from the tube in air guess otherwise how could the sound be heard what is the physical reason why there must be pressure waves nodes at the open end of tube as in picture

256285 as far as understand the definition of second the cs atom has two hyperfine ground states which dont really understand what they are but its not really important with specific energy difference between them whenever the atom transitions from the higher energy to the lower energy state the difference in energy is released as photon photon with that energy is equivalent to em radiation of specific frequency second is then defined as divided by this frequency in many places see people claiming that the cesium atom oscillates between the two states transitioning from one to the next times per second and that this is what the definition is based on this makes no sense to me and seems incompatible with the interpretation above which is based on the energy of single transition not to rapid transitions so usually just dismiss it and or correct the person claiming this when saw the oscillations interpretation repeated in video by the hugely popular vsauce started to think maybe got it all wrong maybe the second is defined by oscillations after all or maybe the two interpretations are somehow equivalent so is there any truth to vsauces description and if not why is the misconception of oscillations so popular

257153 confuse the four kinds of fundamental interactions so think the electric force and magnetic force should not be classified as big class called electromagnetism here is my evidence the gauss law of electric force is related to the surface integration but the amperes law corresponds with path integration the electric field can be caused by single static charge while the magnetic force is caused by moving charge or two moving infinitesimal current the electric field line is never closed but the magnetic field line except those to infinity is closed curve

257608 in general if wave carries energy density with velocity it also carries momentum density ive seen this explicitly shown for electromagnetic waves and longitudinal sound waves however im having trouble seeing how the momentum density of transverse wave on string can be anything besides zero the string elements only ever move up or down so they cant have longitudinal momentum and if you compute the force on any small piece of string its net horizontal component is zero these suggest the momentum density and flow of momentum density are both zero realize that accounting for higher order effects such as making the wave not purely transverse or having nonuniform stretching of the string can produce longitudinal momentum but if these effects are included the waves wont satisfy the ideal wave equation maybe we have to account for funny nonlinear effects to get the right answer here but we dont have to do this for other kinds of waves so dont think this approach is right unless transverse string waves are somehow unique how do you find the momentum density of transverse wave on string what approximations if any need to be removed

257819 this is follow up question to the answer given at what is the exact gravitational force between two masses including relativistic effects unfortunately the author hasnt been online for few years and therefore does not answer comments any more in the answer given there the differential equation of motion in schwarzschild coordinates was ddot frac dot theta frac color red dot theta for the radial acceleration and ddot theta frac dot dot theta for the angular acceleration when plot the path for an object near the speed of light with this formula get stable orbit at but shouldnt that be at the photon sphere with that formula the orbiting particle would fall into the black hole very quickly for example with 999c at when replace the term 3gm with 2gm so that ddot frac dot theta frac color red dot theta get the expected result with stable orbit right at the photon sphere initial velocity again 999c so my question is is the formula wrong and the factor needs to be replaced with factor of or are there different minimum distances for stable orbits one for particles and one for photons or did miss something else wikipedia says the radius of the photon sphere which is also the lower bound for any stable orbit is so would expect that also particles with mass should stay in orbit if they are close to the speed of light and slightly above the photon sphere for reproduction of the problem the mathematica code as believe it to be correct is available with the factor instead of

258008 gravitational wave detectors and particle accelerators have at least one thing in common they require long vacuum tubes through which narrow beam is fired laser in the gravitational wave case particle beam in the accelerator case in both cases the vacuum tube is many orders of magnitude wider than the beam itself but interestingly while the lhcs vacuum tubes are cm in diameter ligos are about times wider at in diameter so my question is why are ligos vacuum tubes so wide this must have been conscious design consideration since it means that much larger volume of vacuum must be maintained and more material must be used to construct the tube the main consideration for tube width that can think of is that you have to be able to aim your beam within the width allotted but surely on these grounds ligo could have gotten away with much narrower tube actually have no idea is this even the deciding factor for the tube width at the lhc

259334 as understand the energy time uncertainty principle cant be derived from the generalized uncertainty relation this is because time is dynamical variable and not an observable in the same sense momentum is every undergraduate qm book have encountered has given very rough proof of the time energy uncertainty relation but not something that is rigorous or something even remotely close to being rigorous so is there an actual proof for it if so could someone please provide me link to it or even provide me with proof keep in mind that am not looking proof using quantum mechanical principles as comments below pointed out edit all the proofs have found take the generalized uncertainty relation and say let dq dt cf this phys se post but this for me does not suffice as rigorous proof people give that precise meaning but the relation is proven just by defining so am just looking for proofif there is any that shows that meaning through mathematics if no better proof exists so be it then will be happy with just the proof through which we define that quantity by defining it in this way there is room for interpretation and this shows from the multiple meaning that researchers have given to that quantity all concerning time of course

259501 how come mineral oil is better lubricant than water even though water has lower viscosity when two surfaces slide over each other with gap filled with fluid the different layers of the fluid are dragged at different speeds the very top layer touching the top metal surface will have the same speed as the surface itself while the bottommost layer is stationary the speed in the layers between is distributed linearly and there exist friction forces between those layers that slow the movement those frictional forces should be reduces however if fluid with lower viscosity is chosen how come this is not so does it have to do with waters polarity so that it sticks to surfaces in different way than oil
259732 have seen many folks doing this moon shadow experiment concluding that shadow from point on the moon can travel to point on the moon faster than light what fail to understand here and am sure am wrong is nothing can travel faster than light also read about relativity where einstein stated that every event happening for you depends on how fast the light gets from where the event is happening to you this is my particular problem with this moon shadow experiment you cannot make shadow travel faster than light because in order for the disappearance of light to get to the moon it has to travel at light speed here is one way to understand my point consider we shine flashlight on moon like the guy in the linked video did we move the finger across the face of the flashlight before we moved the finger it was casting the shadow at point on moon after we finish moving our finger the shadow is at point on the moon when the finger reaches the end of its moving length the light waves that have left the flashlight before the finger reached there will have to hit point and it will take them second and half to get there and another second and half for us to see that shadow on point which makes it seconds finger moving time for us to actually see the shadow at point that means shadow traveled say across the diameter of the moon in seconds so about km in seconds make it km per seconds which is very tiny compared to the speed of light how can these experiments conclude that shadow could be made to travel faster than light what is the obvious clue that am missing here
259759 my question pertains to possible inconsistency between the first law of thermodynamics and the general expansion of space itself first the knowns space itself has and continues to expand the acceleration aspect is not relevant to the discussion empty space in vacuum has intrinsic energy some refer to this as dark energy energy cannot be created or destroyed as per the first law of thermodynamics concisely what is the source of energy that is imbued into this new space few speculations the energy for this process is taken from something other source that already exists inside or outside the known universe the energy for this process is created from nothing thus violating the first law if space itself is quantized perhaps the planck length itself is expanding across the universe giving the appearance that new space is created but actually it is just the space particles themselves that are expanding at some critical point this expanding space would have observable consequences for our own scale of existence these ponderings can also be applied to the big bang theory either energy was created at some point from nothing or existence of anything has been an infinite cycle into the past either way we are dealing with infinites create something from nothing and you will find infinites cropping into your calculations

261018 this may seem dumb question but cant visualize this in my mind if photons are travelling straight then from our eyes or telescope we should only see part of the star for example because our eyes or the opening of our telescopes arent as big as the diameter of that star if photons are not travelling in straight line then we should see blurry image not the actual shape of those objects can someone explain what is really happening

261303 when one pours water out of bottle it first flows smoothly but then pressure blockage develops and the pouring becomes interrupted and turbulent so that the water comes out in splashes this seems to slow down the flow of water from the bottle what is the optimal way to pour the water so that it completely empties fastest possible strategies holding the bottle at certain angle wildly shaking the bottle squeezing the bottle other it probably depends on the shape of the opening and or the bottle itself but we shall assume this beautiful example of standard water bottle clarification the question is asking how to pour the water the fastest so no straws hole insertion and evaporating lasers allowed
261571 what is the farthest object which we can get direct detailed visual image of using visible light which appears more than just dot and falls into one of the following categories planet satellite star asteroids think pluto is the farthest weve imaged visually using new horizons can the hubble telescope take detailed images of say star
261650 when speed is the path traveled in given time and the path is constant as it is for why cant light escape black hole it may take long time to happen but shouldnt there be some light escaping every so often im guessing that because time is infinite inside black hole that this would be one possible reason but wouldnt that mean that we would require infinite mass what is contradicting with measuring black holes in solar masses what means they dont contain infinite mass so how can this be
261654 im following this paper arxiv hep ph where its said that the total number of distinct tree level diagrams at points with cubic vertices only is 2n want to know where this 2n comes from im trying to count the diagrams but its getting difficult to generalize previously in the same paper the full tree amplitude is written as mathcal text tree ldotsn sum mathcal ldotsn mathrm tr cdots text tree ldotsn where the sum is over all noncyclic permutations of legs which is equivalent to all permutations keeping leg fixed this would give diagrams for its easy to see the overcounting the possible arrangements are the and channels precisely cdot1 and the overcounting in the amplitude expression arises from ab ba with my notation mean for for there are cdot3 cdot1 diagrams but now dont see so clear how to extract the overcounting similarly now in my notation cabde means leg inserted in propagator for for there are cdot5 cdot3 cdot1 diagrams but guess the pattern should be able to be seen from the previous cases and taking into account that now there are two different topologies cdabef and abcdef where cd neq dc feel like im in the right track but however not getting anywhere also tried to brute force relation between the and the but only got 2n frac 12n which tells me nothing
261680 have read this article which says that conversion efficiency of the led have exceeded the results are published in physical review letters in their experiments the researchers reduced the led input power to just picowatts and measured an output of picowatts of light an efficiency of how is this possible is it not the violation of conservation of energy or am missing something edit missed that the led worked as te cooler and absorb heat from atmosphere to convert it to light but still it is overwhelming observation for me is it really possible that device use thermal energy to produce light
262005 it is shamefully charge free but presumably if we can tune its velocity lot of interesting things can be done right so was there any proposal for obtaining high velocity neutrons
262101 am taking course in mathematics that covers countability the trick with the uncountability of the real line is that no matter how many times you divide up an interval there would still be real number inside of that interval so that even the smallest interval contains more than infinite amount of numbers however it seems that our reality as we experience it on earth behaves nothing like the real line for example the total number of blades of grass in soccer field is countable similarly the cardinality of all the sand on the beach is also countable ants leaves anything macroscopic not just countable but finite but what about things that are smaller for example numbers of thermally excited electrons over surface or number of photons hitting our retina what are some things that can be truly considered uncountable within our universe obviously excluding the multiverse hypothesis
262298 for electricity we have one charge for the strong force three how many are there connected to the weak force three because of the and particles for the weak force there is the isospin which plays the role as for example the electric charge plays for the interaction then there is the relation 2q where is the weak hypercharge the unit of electrical charge and the weak isospin along axis weak isospin and weak hypercharge seem rather artificial to me instead of real charges in the old theory of the strong force there were three particles like the and the particle for the weak force that were thought to convey the strong nuclear force the pi particles and the pi particle it turned out these interactions were residual the same can be true for the weak interaction maybe there is more fundamental very strong interaction much stronger than the strong nuclear force whos residual force is the weak interaction see for example this article page if our conjecture is correct the weak interactions should not be considered as one of the fundamental forces of nature in order to prove such conjecture we should be able to derive the observed weak interaction phenomena from our fundamental hyper colour and colour forces this we cannot do at present however we are able to study the symmetry properties of the forces among hypercolour singlet composite fermions
262382 the imagined scenario part from special relativity we know that velocity is relative physical quantity that is it is dependent on the frame of reference of choice this means that kinetic energy is also relative but this does not undermine the law of conservation of energy as long as we are consistent with our choice of frame so far so good part on the other hand from statistical mechanics we know that the average kinetic energy of system and its temperature are directly related by the boltzmann constant langle rangle frac langle rangle frac which leads to conclude that when the notion of temperature in physics is expressed in terms of systems kinetic energy then it too ought to be relative quantity which is bit mind boggling because had always thought of temperature as absolute part furthermore we know that all objects at non zero temperature radiate electromagnetic energy with wavelength given as function of the body objects temperature this is the blackbody radiation thus in principle am able to infer an objects temperature the temperature in its own rest frame of reference by measuring its emitted radiation regardless of the frame find myself in but this seems to violate the previously expected relativity of temperature as defined by average kinetic energy proposed resolutions the resolutions that imagine to this paradox are depending on the frame of reference from which measure the emitted blackbody radiation of the object the radiation will undergo different doppler blue red shifts thus the relativity of the temperature in the context of blackbody radiation is preserved due to the doppler effect suspect that treating temperature as nothing but an average kinetic energy does not in general hold true and to resolve this paradox one should work with more general definition of temperature which admit do not know how in general temperature ought to be defined if not in terms of state of motion of systems particles case resolves this hypothetical paradox by including the doppler effect but does not contradict the relativity of temperature case on the other hand resolves the problem by challenging the definition that was used for temperature which in the case that we define temperature more generally without relating to kinetic energy may leave temperature as an absolute quantity and not relative to frame main question but surely only one can be correct here which begs to ask what was the logical mistakes committed in the above scenario in case there was no mistake which of the two proposed resolutions are correct if none what is then the answer here very curious to read your input
262521 have been asked several times that why do we use orthogonal axes in coordinate systems and was always replying that because of simplicity but today morning someone asked me that question and after my answer he said how thought and three examples came to mind as how orthogonal coordinate systems make simplicity in plane for instance if we use non orthogonal coordinate system we will have vec is unit vector vec large frac sin gamma theta sin gamma vec large frac sin theta sin gamma vec if gamma then sin gamma and denominators will be removed as shown below vec cos theta vec sin theta vec this simplicity is appeared when we use dot product of vectors also for example when we want to calculate work done by force in plane we write int vec cdot mathrm vec if we break force vec to two orthogonal vector that one of them is parallel to mathrm vec then work done by the other force perpendicular to mathrm vec will be zero in plane for instance if vec vec vec then magnitude of vec is equal to sqrt large 2bc cos theta theta is the angle between vectors vec and vec if theta then cos theta and we will have sqrt large in cross product of vectors if we break them to orthogonal vectors then our calculations will become much easier because we know that vec times vec ab sin theta theta is the angle between vec and vec if we use orthogonal coordinates for breaking vectors the angles that are involved in our problem will be or that make our calculations so easy so have two questions is there any other reason that why we use orthogonal coordinate systems except simplification is there any other example about simplification thanks lot we are talking about classical mechanics only about first question think there is no reason except simplification because believe that physical laws are independent of coordinate systems think physical phenomenon occur as they are regardless of whether we can observe or measure them or not but wanted to ask if am missing something about second question wanted to ask for more useful examples because believe that when students ask questions like current question it will be better for education that we express many examples as much as we can because more examples more clarification and interest for students
262530 in stanislaw lems novel solaris the planet is able to correct its own trajectory by some unspecified means assuming its momentum and angular momentum is conserved it doesnt eject or absorb any mass would this be possible in newtonian mechanics and how if not can it be proven the assumption is that the planet orbits star or perhaps binary star system intuitively this seems possible to me for example tidal forces result in planet losing its rotational energy so it seems possible that by altering its shape body could alter at least its rotation speed my ideas go as follows assume we have an ideal rod consisting of two connected mass points the rod rotates and orbits around central mass when one of the points moves towards the central body we extend the rod getting it closer to the center thus increasing the overall gravitational force that acts on the rod when one of the points is getting away from the center we shrink the rod again thus decreasing the combined gravitational force havent run any simulations yet but it seems this principle could work update an even more complex scenario conserving momentum and angular momentum would be if the planet ejected piece of matter and absorbed it again after some time
262703 this is statement presumably in mass longevity energy output many people that ive met have heard in school and it is known in pop culture however according to wikipedia about of the stars in the universe are red dwarfs which greatly differ from the sun ive tried doing little bit of research and ive found that the sun is average if you exclude all the dwarf stars from you calculations is there good reason why this is done
262813 was looking at eclipse footage and noticed that it doesnt get any noticeably darker until the very end when it suddenly all the light is gone as the moon blocks out the sun would expect that the brightness would gradually decrease as less of the sun became visible as bright when the moon covers half of it however judging from all the videos out there this is not true took look at the wikipedia article and it says partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable as it takes well over coverage to notice any darkening at all even at it would be no darker than civil twilight why would this be the case also found this diagram that may help illustrate my question would expect the graph to be more of linear shape rather than being so exponential
262820 the boltzmann brain idea as understand it suppose the universe has an infinite lifetime once heat death is achieved there are no more large scale structures to the universe everything is just particles random floating around but just by chance these particles will sometimes randomly form themselves into structures one possible structure is human brain in exactly the state as your brain right now with neurons firing in way appropriate to the memories perceptions you have right now given that heat death state lasts indefinitely we would expect to be one of these randomly formed brain structures as opposed to being human that exists because of being born etc usually when see this argument its asserted that boltzmann brain would vanish almost instantaneously my question is why if atoms randomly arrange themselves into something like brain why wouldnt this structure persist like an actual brain this is the position understand this blog post to be taking think theres something dont understand about entropy because from this perspective dont even see why there would be heat death in the first place given infinite time wouldnt the uniform sea of randomly moving atoms just by chance happen to arrange itself into universe that is self perpetuating state and continue from there
262877 first of congrats to the people at ligo in this article the bbc notes that the latest ligo results show that new black hole was formed with spin of dimensionless number what exactly is this number is this simply the ratio of the angular momentum that the blackhole is observed to have as ratio of the maximal angular momentum as limited by some physics kerr metric
262953 can you measure something about something without adding or removing energy from it this comment has got me wondering if there is way to measure property or quantity of something without some kind of energy exchange or energy conversion it asks me for an example and cant think of any right now so the answer here needs some any well though out example if the answer is yes
263197 context in one of his most popular books guards guards terry pratchett makes an entropy joke knowledge equals power which equals energy which equals mass pratchett is fantasy comedian and every third phrase in his book is joke therefore there is no good reason to believe it pratchett uses that madness to make up that huge library has tremendous gravitational push the question work with computers and mostly with encryption my work colleagues believe terry pratchetts statement because of entropy on the other hand believe it is incorrect since entropy of information is different entropy than the one used in thermodynamics am correct and if so why do use the same name entropy to mean two different things also what would be good way to explain that these two entropies are different things to non scientists people without chemistry or physics background
263222 in chapter of peskin and schroeder when theyre talking about dirac matrices and dirac field bilinears they introduce gamma and give some properties of it one of the properties is gamma mu nu then they say that this means the dirac representation must be reducible since eigenvectors of gamma whose eigenvalues are different transform without mixing this criterion for reducibility is known as schurs lemma ive looked at the wikipedia page for schurs lemma and at various math notes online about schurs lemma and dont see the relevance here understand schurs lemma to be something like this that if you have an irreducible representation of algebra on vector space and linear operator on that vector space commutes with that representation for every element in the algebra then the linear operator is either or invertible how does this reduce down to since eigenvectors of gamma whose eigenvalues are different transform without mixing
263561 comparing the work required for mass to escape the earths gravity to the necessary initial kinetic energy gives us the escape velocity from the surface of the earth of around mathrm km cdot but assuming no air friction and hence no loss in energy on the axis perpendicular to gravity it shouldnt matter what angle the projectile is projected at is this true if there were no air and we fired projectile at circ to the horizontal at velocity of mathrm km cdot should it still escape the earths gravity despite such low sin01 circ mathrm cdot vertical velocity could it be that firing projectile horizontally at the escape velocity in frictionless medium would result in perfect orbit also taking escape velocity of mathrm cdot and radius af earth of mathrm and mathrm cdot on flat earth if you fired an object horizontally at mathrm cdot it would fall mathrm after mathrm but using trigonometry the earth would have curved away by mathrm twice the value necessary for an orbit can someone check this

264029 wikipedia defines momentum as in classical mechanics in classical mechanics linear momentum or translational momentum is the product of the mass and velocity of an object however an electromagnetic field has momentum which is how solar sails work would not suppose that this is product of the mass and velocity of the field light has momentum too as understand so what is momentum conceptually

264231 know that the mass of binary star system is given by keplers law mathrm frac pi gt further we know that frac frac frac therefore if we are able to determine the period and velocity of the stars we can then determine their mass the period of the stars can be easily determined by the period of splitting of the spectroscopic binarys spectral lines also it is possible to determine the velocity of the stars by the extent of red shift blue shift of the spectral lines however what if the binary stars werent orbiting in plane parallel to the observer but rather on an angle can the velocity of the binary stars still be determined and hence can its mass still be determined if this is not possible is there any other means in which their mass can be determined
264240 when someone nearby is listening to music through earphones or headphones usually you can only hear the bass unless its really loud where you can hear the singers voice and the other instruments too why are the bass sounds more audible the answer probably has to do with the bass sound waves having the highest wavelengths was able to gain some insight from this question however not real answer as it focuses on the way sound waves travel across room and through walls and not on ear headphones

264351 understand that in thermodynamics entropy has precise definition the infinitesimal change of entropy being the infinitesimal heat transfer divided by the temperature and that in statistical mechanics for system consisting of large number of identical subsystems so to speak it is the log of the number of possible distributions of the subsystems corresponding to some given energy levels and from what understand the second law of thermodynamics basically says that for some simple systems such as two reservoirs at different temperatures connected to each other and isolated from the rest heat goes from hot to cold so that the fact that the entropy wants to be as big as possibly can is similar to systems going towards an equilibrium state at least for simple systems such as the one above please forgive me if my descriptions here are not so accurate from physical point of view for am not physicist just mathematician fine but frequently see people linking entropy to chaos assume there is some scientific work which started this train of thought and then the media kept stretching the words further and further can someone please point me to that scientific work also is the link between entropy and chaos valid in the eyes of modern physicists have seen few questions that overlap with mine but have not found the exact answer to my question
264412 this question is going to look lot like duplicate but ive read dozens of related posts and they dont touch the subject here we go why are observables represented by hermitian operators because then well measure real stuff since the eigenvalues are real because hermitian operators actually normal operators have complete set of eigenvectors and well be sure the accessible states of our experiment will be modelled consistently those are the two main reasons for the physicists of the early xx century to have chosen hermitian operators as mathematical model of what we can observe mathematics proves they provide both the needed properties my question is of philosophical inclination which one of the above requirements is more fundamental im inclined to think the most important property is to be able to represent the system by the right model which is ii real eigenvalues come as bonus ive read that having real eigenvalues is more important but dont see why they couldnt be complex maybe nature is tricking us some way and we only measure their real part the problem for me would be describing the system with model that doesnt mirror our accessible states and is therefore flawed maybe both are fundamental on the same level maybe the question is stupid what do you think

264509 have read the most basic and important parts of vector calculus are gradient divergence and curl these three things are too important to analyse vector field and have gone through the physical meaning of gradient divergence and curl gradient indicates the direction of maximum rate of change of function and it is defined as nabla mathbf equiv mathrm grad mathbf where mathbf is scalar function of the position vector mathbf whereas divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux from an infinitesimal volume around point and is defined as boldsymbol nabla boldsymbol cdot mathbf mathbf equiv mathrm div mathbf mathbf and the curl signifies the infinitesimal rotation around point and is defined as boldsymbol nabla boldsymbol times mathbf mathbf equiv mathrm curl mathbf mathbf and now have study and also mathematically formulate that boldsymbol nabla boldsymbol cdot left boldsymbol nabla boldsymbol times mathbf mathbf right mathrm div left mathrm curl mathbf mathbf right and boldsymbol nabla boldsymbol times left nabla mathbf right mathrm curl left mathrm grad mathbf right boldsymbol where is scalar function now my question is how can interpret those two expressions mean want the physical significance of these two expressions in the sense of definition of gradient divergence curl and also using graphical representation

264950 according to electrodynamics accelerating charged particles emit electromagnetic radiation im asking myself if the electron in an hydrogen atom emits such radiation in how can one describe electron motion around hydrogen atom murod abdukhakimov says the total momentum of the electron is zero hence it does not emit radiation could someone prove this statement it may be an obvious question but cant figure out why the total momentum of the electron should always be zero in any energy state
264991 question what is the general definition of one particle states vec rangle in an interacting qft by general mean non perturbative and non asymptotic context for example in weigands notes page we can read edited by me as vec these operators can be diagonalised simultaneously write the eigenstates as begin aligned lambda vec rangle lambda lambda vec rangle vec lambda vec rangle vec lambda vec rangle end aligned tag one particle states are those with vec sqrt vec for me this is on the right track as general definition because we are defining vec rangle as the eigenstates of operators that commute which is fine but there are some issues with this definition why is function of vec why is not an independent label on vec rangle just as xp yp are independent why is not independent as well once we know that vec how do we know that vec is constant we define mass as that constant but only once we know that it is actually constant by covariance can see that has to be scalar but im not sure whats the reason that this scalar has to be independent of for example in principle we could have how do we know that these vec rangle are non degenerate why couldnt we have for example vec pn rangle vec vec pn rangle with sim alpha as in the hydrogen atom these properties are essential to prove for example the ll lehmann spectral representation which is itself non perturbative non asymptotic result context in srednickis book page we can read edited by me let us now consider langle phix rangle where rangle is one particle state with four momentum using phix mathrm ipx phi0 mathrm ipx we can see that langle phix rangle mathrm ipx tag this only works if mu rangle mu rangle which we could take as the definition of rangle yet again dont know why we would expect to be constant that we could identify with mass or why are the eigenstates of mu non degenerate the expression is essential to scattering theory but the result itself is supposedly non asymptotic right also it fixes the residue of the two point function which is one of the renormalisation conditions on the self energy pim this means that is very important result so id like to have formal definition of rangle in standard non relativistic qm is function of vec because is function of vec but in qft is not function of vec it is different operator

265301 most textbooks make it clearly that crystal momentum is not true momentum however in lot of literature crystal momentum is treated as true momentum heres two examples rashba spin splitting it is known that spin orbit coupling in solids can be mathematically expressed as nabla times vec cdot vec if nabla is along vec direction it can be simplified to vec times vec cdot vec then in most literature it is directly converted to vec times vec cdot vec and vec here is the crystal momentum cdot method in heterostructures in heterostructures common method to derive the hamiltonian is to replace crystal momentum in original cdot hamiltonian by hbar nabla which is the true momentum operator for example if some system is described by cdot hamiltonian hk if we cut strip along direction and break translational periodicity in direction it is common to use hbar partial to describe this strip to summarize it seems crystal momentum can sometimes be treated as true momentum why is that
265459 wikipedia states that photon has spin of value what want to know is this are there two possible spins for photons and like electrons which can have or if the spin quantum number the same as spin has to be essentially positive to quote wikipedia the conventional definition of the spin quantum number is where can be any non negative integer then what is the term for possible sign states of that spin value is it called parity would there be any difference of behavior circular polarization event such as through solution of glucose since through solution of such chirally asymmetric molecules whole portion of applied plane polarized light light turns in single direction from which the compound is analyzed and given nomenclature could conclude that all the photons present in the applied plane polarized light contain only type of spin out of for that particular experiment optical rotation

266114 im taking course in nanotech and were discussing nanoelectronics this has led to discussion of conductors semiconductors and insulators have number of lovely diagrams explaining the fact that there is band gap of energy states that fall in between quantum energy levels that are forbidden for electrons to occupy understand the concept of quanta and why an electron cannot take on an energy state in this band gap what dont understand is simply this why is it that when an electron is in the valence band it doesnt conduct but when it is in the conduction band it does in other words what physically speaking is special about the conduction band that is not characteristic of the valence band or any lower filled bands in other words have read and heard that the electrons in the conduction band are free to roam in sea of electrons but from what are they free the pull of an atomic nucleus some other kind of intermolecular or interatomic forces is there something physically unique about conduction band electrons that is distinct from electrons not in the conduction band guess in the final analysis am trying to get grasp for quintessential conduction ness that will help me understand the fundamental principle of conductivity will be taking course in electricity and magnetism in semesters and will no doubt learn great deal more about this but for now any light you can shed would be helpful not only in this course but in understanding superconductance as well because that is all about getting electrons into the conduction band and then keeping them there by dropping the resistance to
266127 so this might sound kind of ridiculous but was thinking about relativity and since gravity is warping of space time or time dilation why dont we measure atomic mass in units of time dilation if that makes any sense wouldnt that give us better understanding of the basic elemental content of cosmological objects above and beyond the reflection of light we study in spectroscopy guess maybe im just confused as to what weight is if it isnt the warping of space time we could call it the fermat scale
266246 problems the question am about to make is either too stupid or hasnt bothered anyone because its obvious because cant really find the answer anywhere am currently studying electricity and magnetism and my book starts by telling that matter consists of atoms that are made of heavy positively charged nucleus and cloud of light negatively charged electrons orbiting around it and it bases the rest of the book on these facts however electricity positive and negative charges were studied before the atomic theory was confirmed actually at that time it wasnt even remotely supported benjamin franklin for example thought that electrical charge was some kind of cloud gas when there was abundance of this cloud the charge was positive while otherwise it was negative questions firstly suppose that classically we define charge as the physical property that objects have to have in order to interact electrically at least for now how did physicists back then know about the existence of two charges positive and negative sure if you bring two glass rods close after rubbing them with silk they repel each other while if you bring glass rod and one plastic rod they attract each other but is that really enough moreover how did they know that opposite charges attract while same charges repel each other you cant arbitrarily choose to be so since electrons really do repel each other was there way to tell that glass rod had abundance of that cloud after the rubbing while the plastic had deficit in my book it is said that franklin after series of experiments determined that there are two kinds of charges without elaborating cannot find those experiments anywhere all get is about the famous kite experiment
266308 recently in the last week or two various articles about pear shaped nuclei have appeared such as this one from science alert and this from the bbc the science alert article includes the quote weve found these nuclei literally point towards direction in space this relates to direction in time proving theres well defined direction in time and we will always travel from past to present and further on so what does all of this have to do with time travel its pretty out there hypothesis but scheck says that this uneven distribition of mass and charge causes barium 144s nucleus to point in certain direction in spacetime and this bias could explain why time seems to only want to go from past to present and not backwards even if the laws of physics dont care which way it goes theyve also linked to copy of the paper on the arxiv the papers way over my head so couldnt do much more than scan but no mention of time travel seems to be mentioned there do these assertions about time travel make sense and if so why do they make sense what does the direction which the nucleus points in have to do with the direction of time
266309 any data that we have on the big bang comes from the cosmic microwave background cmb which was created about years after the big bang from there we have been able to calculate what the universe was like prior to the cmbs creation by applying the laws of physics up until the planck era in which our model simply doesnt work any more then how do we know some things about what happened during before the planck era how do we know that the universe started out as an infinitesimal point and not very small but not infinitesimally small region of space if everything we know including this was calculated backwards from the cmb and our calculations stop working at the planck era how did we deduce this
266359 when we say electron has spin of frac is that the value of the total spin of electron or the projection on axis or the spin quantum number when we say electron has spin of frac hbar is that the value of the total spin or projection also sometimes people say just spin without hbar is spin quantum number analogous to the total orbital angular momentum or to the projection of am confused because when am trying to learn addition of angular momeneta eg in coupling where we use formula vec vec vec to get total angular momentum for the particle and then we sum all into vec sum vec what is the in this context mean in the equation vec vec vec since we are summing it with vec then it must be spin projection on axis right
266492 rather stupid question why can we see the moon when it is between the earth and the sun
266507 this is probably an obvious question but dont see it answered anywhere imagine we have an object in the universe that is traveling relative to the milkyway at about 99999999999999999999999999c and realize thats not possible but imagine speed is relative so to the object the milkyway is flying past it and to us the object is flying past us thats all good and relative but the photons that our superfast object encounters are gonzo blue shifted and relativity says thats ok too but lets say the object is traveling so fast the photons it encounters are energetic enough to spontaneously undergo pair production that seems difficult to explain relatively low energy visible light photon to our perception wont split into an electron and positron but very energetic photon can but its the same photon just observed by different reference frames understand that observers wont agree on when things happen or on energy but the two observers should agree on events that take place and pair production for one but not the other seems impossible is there simple laymans way that this can be explained
266561 in recent paper doi arxiv of note for causing this recent tussle over its handling by science news media theres some strange units cant quite puzzle out specifically the abstract contains the phrase corresponds to reduced be3 probability of mathrm the unit is used several more times in the body of the text but it is never explained so imagine its relatively standard in nuclear physics on the other hand its not in the si brocure so im surprised that prl let paper through that doesnt define it appropriately however standard it may be in the field which would make it acceptable to use unexplained in regular physical review paper in venue thats for general physics audience in any case what is this unit what does it mean how does one use it and what are the physics behind it
266684 we always have been said that we dont need to real values we just need to differences for example mathrm du mathrm dt and delta int mathrm dt so have some questions how are we sure that we dont need real values for example initial values at zero time can we determine initial values at zero time for example u0 is it possible to have physics by other mathematics except calculus so that we dont face with such this problems initial values problem
266834 in equations that have quantities with physical dimension example mathrm force mathrm mass mathrm acceleration or ma know that we use that mass force to help what we should use in the equation but why dont we just use mathrm kg cdot mathrm mathrm or mathrm newton mathrm kilograms mathrm meter mathrm seconds as the equation can any equation be wrong by doing that know that some equations are used in specific places ranges situations but even with words instead of units in equations we need to know the application boundaries of that equation
266992 am mathematics student with hobby interest in physics this means that ive taken graduate courses in quantum dynamics and general relativity without the bulk of undergraduate physics courses and sheer volume of education into the physical tools and mindset that the other students who took the course had like noethers theorem lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics statistical methods and so on the courses themselves went well enough my mathematical experience more or less made up for lacking physical understanding however still havent found an elementary explanation of gauge invariance if there is such thing am aware of some examples like how the magnetic potential is unique only up to time constant gradient also came across it in linearised general relativity where there are several different perturbations to the spacetime metric that give the same observable dynamics however to really understand whats going on like to have simpler examples unfortunately havent been able to find any guess since gauge invariance is such frightening phrase no one use that word when writing to high school student so my very simple question is in many high school physics calculations you measure or calculate time distance potential energy temperature and other quantities these calculations very often depend only on the difference between two values not the concrete values themselves you are therefore free to choose zero to your liking is this an example of gauge invariance in the same sense as the graduate examples above or are these two different concepts
267035 the conventional way physicists describe neutrinos is that they have very small amount of mass which entails they are traveling close to the speed of light heres wikipedia quote which is also reflected in many textbooks it was assumed for long time in the framework of the standard model of particle physics that neutrinos are massless thus they should travel at exactly the speed of light according to special relativity however since the discovery of neutrino oscillations it is assumed that they possess some small amount of mass thus they should travel slightly slower than the speed of light wikipedia measurements of neutrino speed taken at face value this language is very misleading if particle has mass no matter how small its speed is completely relative and to say that neutrinos travel close to the speed of light without qualification is just as incorrect as saying electrons or billiard balls travel close to the speed of light so what is the reason everyone repeats this description is it because all the neutrinos we detect in practice travel close to the speed of light if so then have this question neutrinos come at us from all directions and from all sorts of sources stars nuclear reactors particle accelerators etc and since they have mass just like electrons would have thought we should see them traveling at all sorts of speeds surely some cosmic neutrino sources are traveling away from the earth at very high speeds for example or what about neutrinos emitted from particles in accelerators so like said at the start where are all the slow neutrinos and why do we perpetuate the misleading phrase close to the speed of light without contextual qualification
267036 have phrased similarly another question about how physicists knew that two charges exist positive and negative the purpose of the question is not necessarily to educate me historically its just that wish to know about classical subjects without making the atomic assumption know that electrons elementary negatively charged particles move in contrast with protons elementary positively charged particles because electrons have small mass and orbit the nucleus while protons are stuck in the nucleus of atoms roughly at least charging by induction works because of the transfer of electrons negative charge between conductive sphere and the ground but it could be very well explained by the transfer of either positive or negative charge but only the later happens was there any thought experiment to show that only negative charges happen to move transfer
267196 was in doubt so went to wikipedia there it says the photon has zero rest mass but on the side description it says the mass is mathrm ev so is the mass of the photon really zero or do we just consider it to be zero because its negligible more generally are there massless particles at all
267208 was soldering very thin wire today and when had one end firmly soldered accidentally bumped the wire diagonally with my tweezers what id expect to happen is that the wire oscillates for little while in one axis then stops however what actually occurred is quite different and much more interesting recorded it in real time https youtu be o5nfnly7l7s sorry for the poor macro focus and recorded it again at 480fps and imported it into tracker video analysis https youtu be 9jhdsypkqkq as you can see the rotational motion fully reverses here are some still frames from tracker the wire begins to rotate clockwise after being excited the wire begins to oscillate in one axis and mindbogglingly begins to rotate counterclockwise clearer views in the videos above the and axis motion plotted by tracker raises even more questions as you can see the axis motion simply stops then restarts whats going on my first thought was that because this wire wasnt originally straight there was some sort of unusual standing wave set up but this occurs even with completely straight wire im absolutely sure theres something about two axis simple harmonic motion that im missing but just cannot think of what is causing this ive seen many other home experiment questions on this site so thought this would an acceptable question hope its not breaking any rules edit okay ive got some more data ive set up little solenoid plunger system that produces no torque or two axis motion and its very repeatable here https youtu be zani6vmovd8 what ive noticed is that can get almost any wire even with degree bend to exhibit single axis motion with this setup with no spinning or deviation and if try enough the same thing can happen with the tweezers it seems like if slide the tweezers slightly when exciting the wire can reliably produce this odd motion dont know what that indicates edit2 okay seems like with the plunger solenoid still can get this circular motion even with straight wire edit3 okay so wanted to test sammys suggestion once and for all assume that changing the moment of inertia to torsion of the wire would affect his theory so soldered small piece of wire perpendicularly to the end of the main wire then recorded the motion and then took off the perpendicular wire and re recorded the data and then did it again got noisy data first time edit the final test floriss hypothesis requires that the resonant frequency of wire in each cardinal direction be different to measure this used my solenoid setup that did not cause rotation as above put straight piece of wire between light source and light dependent resistor and connected it to an oscilloscope the signal was very faint millivolts but my scope was able to pull it out of the noise have determined this in the direction the resonant frequency of just straightened straight sample wire unknown cycle frequency is 81hz 1hz in the direction the resonant frequency of sample wire is 60hz 1hz so theres definitely significant difference percent between the cardinal directions good enough proof for me edit actually since my light detector above produces two pulses per sine wave the actual vibration frequency is so the actual frequencies are hz and 30hz which agrees roughly with floriss data
267209 this thought was inspired by comment from the current leading answer by sentry to the question where are all the slow neutrinos this slow neutrino induced nuclear decay will still be an extremely rare process and the big problem is to distinguish it from normal spontaneous nuclear decay questions which would need to be addressed as corollaries to the main question believe include is such possibility self consistent as theory how does the required energy density of slow neutrinos compare to the postulated energy density of dark matter
267293 lets say we have composite system otimes we take the basis for as rangle rangle the basis for as alpha rangle beta rangle then an entangled state is state which can not be expressed as tensor direct product state like frac sqrt alpha rangle beta rangle my question is can state which can not be expressed as tensor direct product in one basis be expressed as tensor direct product in another basis if yes then it means that the entanglement depends on the basis which think is hard to accept if no then there should be an invariant under the basis transformation to character the entanglement whats that
267371 even if the atom is neutral equal numbers of protons and electrons the electrons and nucleus form an electrical dipole so there is still an electric field around them even though the total charge is zero is this reasoning correct so every atom has an electric field even if it is too weak if not why
267474 have learned that to construct wave pulse we need to superimpose multiple sine waves of different frequencies which all interfere to produce the pulse what dont understand is that wave pulse is produced at certain place and time laser that is quickly turned on and off at given position at given time yet the sine waves that superimpose and make up the pulse extend over all space and time to infinity including before the laser was even turned on if wave pulse is really made up of these sine waves how could these waves have been produced before the pulse even existed
267492 this question is inspired by or follow up to the threads where are all the slow neutrinos and is it possible that all spontaneous nuclear decay is actually slow neutrino induced the cosmic neutrino background consists of the primordial neutrinos from the time when the universe had cooled expanded enough for the neutrinos to decouple and become free this of course is similar to the cosmic microwave background except that photons decoupled at much later time age cdot than neutrinos age my question is what would we expect the to look like today given that we know that neutrinos possess mass according to the linked threads the neutrinos would have become non relativistic today because of the great expansion of space since the time when the universe was only one second old so will the relic neutrinos from be captured gravitationally by galaxies and stars and similar objects in way that today these neutrinos are orbiting galaxy centers stars etc imagine this is like how most cold slow hadronic matter like dust or isolated hydrogen atoms or whatever will be gravitationally bound to galaxies stars etc because if that is the case this neutrino background will no longer be have background appearance so what to expect is the neutrino background still quite isotropic and homogenous and background like maybe even with temperature associated to it or are those particles now captured by all sorts of objects and no longer constituting background of cold slow particles if one assumes particular rest mass for each neutrino say ev maybe it is even possible to answer this quantitatively
267852 is light the thing causing the universal speed limit to be mathrm so the universal speed limit would be different if light travelled faster or slower or is mathrm the universal speed limit anyway and light just goes that fast light is just something we commonly associate with it because it goes super fast
267866 suppose potential vx and suppose bound particle so the allowed energy levels are discrete suppose second potential widetilde such that widetilde geq vx for all suppose the potentials are relevant only for some interval does this necessarily imply that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian with widetilde will be at least those of the hamiltonian with vx that is if are the energy levels of the first hamiltonian and widetilde are the energy levels of the second hamiltonian is leq widetilde for all how can one show this
268009 sound waves travel with constant speed but air molecules that transfer action move with different speeds than the ones described by maxwell distribution why does the sound wave not smear out and dissipate quickly update it is not just that should smear out but that it should do it quickly if we look at distribution of speed of atoms https upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons maxwellboltzmann en svg then we will see that there is no steep peak there is lot of atoms that are percent quicker or slower that the rest with length of sound wave measuring in meter noticeable smear out should happen in tenths and hundreds of second tens of meters and in ultrasonic frequency lot quicker
268011 we all know frac mathrm mathrm little application of the chain rule leads to the relation frac mathrm mathrm but the above equation shows that whenever and this must be wrong as when we throw something vertically from the earth surface it stops and then returns due to gravity there is always an acceleration in the downward direction have come up with two possible ways to solve this problem we know that frac mathrm mathrm so whenever then mathrm no displacement in that infinitely small time also frac mathrm mathrm frac mathrm mathrm frac mathrm mathrm only if mathrm is not equal to as multiplying both numerator and denominator with will make it undefined or multiplying by is not equivalent to multiplying by now since mathrm whenever therefore we can not write frac mathrm mathrm when if we plot curve for the motion whenever as explained mathrm therefore at that instant frac mathrm mathrm the slope of the curve will be not defined as mathrm therefore the equation frac mathrm mathrm will be undefined and we cannot determine acceleration at that instant with the curve now that actually means that by plotting curve we lose information about acceleration of the particle when want method to find the acceleration at that point using curve also explanation for this defect of the curve also would like to add that so far no physics book that had read has explained this before writing this relation also they do not mention that this will not work for would like to add the situation where observed this when you throw something vertically upward with velocity such that it reaches to height then the curve will be the slope of above curve is clearly not defined at 10or the instant where velocity is but we know that there was constant acceleration throughout the flight then how can we find acceleration at that instant also assume that we only have curve or if we cannot then why
268023 came across problem that cannot get my head around consider two very small spherical metallic balls given charges and assume that both can be approximated as point charges now they are connected by straight finite conducting wire current will flow in the wire until the charges on both balls become zero consider point on the perpendicular bisector of the wire at distance from the wire my goal is to find the magnetic field at point when the current in the wire is the following figure illustrates the mentioned situation will now use the amp re maxwell equation to obtain an expression for the field have constructed circular loop of radius around the wire to use the amp re maxwell law firstly one must notice that the two charges produce an electric field everywhere in space and since the balls are getting discharged the electric field is actually changing have calculated the electric flux through the surface when the charges on the balls are and below now for the final substitution so have obtained neat result after all but realized there was problem let me use the biot savart law to find the magnetic field created only due to the current in the wire this is relatively easier calculation since the formula for the field due finite current carrying straight wire is already known the answer turns out to be the same first of all is the answer correct if not where did go wrong this is what cannot understand the biot savart law gives you the magnetic field created merely due to the current flowing in conducting wire on the other hand the amp re maxwell law gives you the net field due to the current carrying wire and due to the induced magnetic field caused by the changing electric field so how is it that get the same answer in both cases the biot savart law cannot account for induced fields right why does there seem to be an inconsistency in the two laws have missed something or used formula where it is not applicable
268062 earths orbit is slight ellipse so to conserve momentum its speed increases when it is closest to the sun if the speed changes there is an acceleration if there is an acceleration there is force even if the change is small and gradual wouldnt we experience force because the earth is so massive
268271 continuing on from the cool physics ad on the threads where are all the slow neutrinos is it possible that all spontaneous nuclear decay is actually slow neutrino induced and what does the cosmic neutrino background look like today given that neutrinos possess mass have follow up question that stems from this answer to that last question more specifically the big bang must have produced bunch of neutrinos and antineutrinos as side effect of the creation of all that matter and past certain point these would decouple from matter and just fly on unimpeded through space over time these neutrinos would get redshifted just like the cosmic microwave background did to form cosmic neutrino background at temperature of around mathrm depending on the neutrino masses this could mean range of velocities but if the neutrinos are relatively massive to quote robs answer they would have typical speeds of under km slower than the escape velocity of some stars cold neutrinos might therefore accumulate in gravitational wells resulting in substantial density enhancement over the cm average you expect over intergalactic space now about this accumulation in gravitational wells have question similar to robs later comment im just the tiniest bit murky on how the cold neutrinos get trapped without scattering but im prepared to believe its discussed in the literature in contrast im completely in the dark on how the cold neutrinos get trapped without scattering youve got this small particle that only interacts gravitationally coming in towards star with velocity at infinity of the order of but smaller than the escape velocity under normal circumstances the particle will approach the star and whizz off again in hyperbolic trajectory that ends up with the same asymptotic velocity it came in with if theres third body to interact with it might get deflected into bound orbit but with no meaningful interactions but gravity this seems very unlikely to me to work on astronomically large numbers of neutrinos what are the rough physics behind the capture of these massive cold neutrinos in gravitational well
268454 im highschool sophomore bear this is mind when answering this question in other words the answer doesnt need to be in total layman terms but it should be understandable by an applied highschool student have no idea what standing wave is please explain bonus question how is standing wave related to the atomic orbit it is my understanding that the atomic orbit is mathematical function that describes the probability of an electron being at certain place but it is also the image of this function in terms of real space the actual dimensional volume around the nucleus that particular electron calls home
268470 are there any fluids with critical point near stp or that are supercritical at stp if not would it be feasible to design molecule for substance with critical point near stp using theoretical computational methods update diracology and floriss great answers helped me find large carbon chain molecules particularly those with large numbers of fluoride atom that atm and 1000k that is within the reach of good bicycle pump and burner in particular kpa 4f kpa kpa given diracology and floriss answer that suggests that something like could be critical at around ordinary pressure and an easily achievable temperature ie it might be possible to get critical fluid by heating some goop in an open saucepan unfortunately this is ignoring the availability cost and safe handling of such substance but otherwise it could make one hell of youtube video it is going to be tough call awarding the bounty which has already been well earned by both diracology and floris
268509 so have often read that at least in northern europe in the colder seasons there is not enough uv light arriving from the sun so many people have not enough vitamin from that at first thought it was simply due to the sun shining for only much shorter period of time in winter compared to summer and hence less possible exposure not to mention that most of the skin area is covered then but just had thought coming to my mind thinking about that in the mornings and evenings we mostly see red light here the higher end of the visible spectrum not getting through am not familiar with the physics behind that phenomenon but thought that the higher end of the spectrum like the invisible uv light may not be getting through here for even longer parts of the day towards and away from high noon and that in winter the part of the day where uv gets through is maybe very narrow and thats why its said not to be enough is that correct and how exactly does this work physically
268568 was trying to figure out which piano keys were being played in an audio recording using spectral analysis and noticed that the harmonics are not integer multiple of the base note what is the reason for this take look at the spectrogram of clean sample from single piano key am using piano ff a4 from here the following is the same as above with superimposed reference grid of mathrm hz as you can see the harmonics have increasingly higher frequencies than integer multiples of mathrm hz at this point you might think that the actual base frequency is just slightly higher than mathrm hz so let us make different reference grid which lines up with the harmonic at mathrm hz you can now clearly see that they arent actually integer multiples of base frequency question what is the explanation for this am looking both for simple high level explanations of what is happening and more in depth instrument specific ones which could maybe allow me to attempt to calculate the harmonics my first reaction was that this must be some non linear effect but you can see that the harmonics do not change frequency at all as time passes and the sound gets quieter would expect non linear effect to be pronounced only in the loudest part of the sample update measured the frequencies using peak detection on the fourier transform from to seconds in the sample this table compares the measured values with integer multiples of meas int mult

268666 if hit tennis ball properly on the stringing does it go further than if rotate the racket degrees in my hand and hit the ball with the same force but on the side of the frame im assuming im good enough to hit the perfect shot in each case arguments for and against range from better elastic energy from the stringing to greater compression of the tennis ball due to the side of the racket providing smaller contact surface area
268733 concerning the recent detection of gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes it has been reported that significant percentage of the combined mass was lost in the resulting production of the gravitational waves so evidently in addition to hawking radiation black holes can also lose mass in collisions with other black holes is there theoretical limit to how much mass as percentage two black holes can lose in collision as gravitational waves could so much mass be lost that the resulting object would no longer have enough gravity to be black hole
268818 how can it be that if like charges repel they dont repel themselves in other words why dont charges break apart about the possible duplicate want to know about charges in general not just that of an electron my response to lawrence crowells answer thank you very much for the extensive explanation unfortunately its bit above my level im first year electrical engineering bachelor student this is how understand it if the charge is the sum of multiple separate charges there has to be an external force that keeps this charges together however we most often think of electrons and protons as point charges in other words we dont think of them as if they are made up from different smaller parts but the idea of electrons and protons as point charges has its own problems didnt know that the electric field has mass from the formula understand that propto frac this would mean that rightarrow infty as rightarrow or which of course is physically not possible but there is way to calculate the radius of an electron based on the mass the speed of light and the constant of planck unfortunately dont know why you can get around this by technique called called renormalization which causes the integral to converge unfortunately dont understand the rest of the answer due to my level in physics nevertheless am grateful for you answer it would be awesome if you could confirm or correct my understanding
268831 im trying to understand entanglement in terms of scarcity and abundance given an arbitrary vector representing pure quantum state of say dimension in mathcal otimes is more likely to be entangled than non entangled separable by trying to answer it myself can see that the separability test is based on an existential quantifier namely trying to prove that exists in mathcal otimes such that otimes the entanglement test on the other hand is based on universal quantifier forall in mathcal otimes otimes neq so this reasoning could suggest that entangled vectors are much more scarce than separable ones because it is easier to find one simple example existential that satisfies the condition than to check for every single one universal this result would make sense physically since entanglement is valuable resource so intuitively it should be scarce does this reasoning make any sense at all or am saying nonsense any help would be greatly appreciated ps would assume extending this reasoning to density matrices would be obvious
268844 still cannot fully comprehend the essence of critical point on phase diagrams it is usually said in textbooks that the difference between liquid and gaseous state of substance is quantitative rather than qualitative while it is easy to understand for liquid solid transition symmetry breaking is qualitative change it is unclear to me what meaning does it have for liquid and its gas there is always quantitative difference between gas at and at is it correct to say just this substance is in gaseous state shouldnt we also specify the path on the phase diagram by which the substance got in its current state did it cross the boiling curve or went over the critical point and never boiled why does critical point even exist blindly would assume that either there is no boiling curve at all since the difference is quantitative the density of substance smoothly decreases with temperatures and increases with pressure or that the boiling curve goes on to infinity to as high pressures and temperatures as would remain molecules intact why does it stop
269090 ive noticed pattern with the electric fields of charged objects of infinite dimensions point charge which can be considered charge of dimensions has an electric field that goes as an infinite line of charge dimensional object has an electric field that goes as the infinite plane 2d has constant electric field or field proportional to and if one considers sphere of electrical charge you can make gaussian sphere inside it and this electric field should grow as im trying to figure out an explanation for this pattern the original question that led me to consider this was the difference between the infinite line and the infinite plane why does one depend on but not the other its addressed briefly in griffiths where believe he says something along the lines of you cant get away from an infinite plane but by that reasoning dont understand how you can get away from an infinite line either the reasoning make some sense if you consider an infinite plank plane that is infinite in one dimension and finite in another so that as you get further away one dimension shrinks while the other continues to appear the same however the perfect infinite line should only have one dimension to begin with so it should appear the same no matter how far away or close you are suppose my questions are these why does this pattern between the dimensions of an object and its field exist how do you get away from an infinite line
269185 for instance placing blue transparent folder in front of desk lamp makes the light that shines through it appear blue from what understand some red car lights do not have red light sources but just that red cover on top how exactly does placing color filter of sorts in the path of light source affect the light that passes through it other than changing the color that we perceive im thinking the intensity drops and there might be polarization but am not sure is there anything else also how exactly can you determine the color of light source because from what understand we may perceive color different than it is id appreciate link to place where could read more on this or an introduction to terms missed out on any help is appreciated thanks
269313 if charge travels in circle it must accelerate thereby producing em however wire in circular loop is analogous to many charges moving in circle so why dont circular currents produce em have not found any evidence that circular currents can produce em similar question is why doesnt alternating current produce light while vibrating single particle with charge will however my question asks about circular wires and direct current thanks
269350 when the mass of planet causes the curvature of space time we see that an approaching free falling object deviates its path towards the planet we also see the amount of that deviation depends on its speed so that slowly moving objects hit the planet while faster ones pass it by obviously the same curvature of space time is experienced by both objects and so it would seem that both of them must follow the same geodesic shortest path through curved space time irrespective of their speed relative to the planet is there relatively easy way of explaining this apparent contradiction without deep study of differential geometry for example
269355 in brian greenes book the elegant universe he talks about the double slit experiment and feynmans interpretation of quantum mechanics according to the book feynman said that one vaild interpretation is that on its way from the emitter to the photoscreen the photon actually takes every possible path greene actually says that some paths include trip to the andromeda galaxy and back as photon takes as said before textit every possible path now if this were really the case and we measure the time between the emission of photon and its impact on the photoscreen doesnt this mean that some photons would actually travel with velocity far greater than the speed of light if photon actually travelled to andromeda and back there is no way it could arrive at the photoscreen in just fraction of second as is observed during experiment
269492 so was told in the physics class that the resistance in parallel circuit is smaller than the resistance in series circuit why does that happen is this statement also true for circuits which have no resistors or resistance offering devices connected to them and also from my calculations the total resistance in parallel circuit is smaller than the resistances of any of the devices connected in the circuit now really dont understand how this can happen
269563 is it possible to construct the hamiltonian of system if its ground state wave function or functional is known understand one should not expect this to be generically true since the hamiltonian contains more information the full spectrum than single state vector but are there any special cases where its possible to obtain the hamiltonian some examples would be really helpful
269669 as you might already know frequency of musical notes is arranged in such way that if for example an note has frequency of another note which is placed one octave higher would produce frequency of 2x so heres my childhood toy glockenspiel this is where my question raised if wave speed inside the bars were the same as in strings of guitar then we would expect two notes that are one octave apart like the two cs would have length ratio but measurement shows that they are designed in approximately ratio or maybe sqrt2 now im wondering what exactly causes this speed variation thickness or width doesnt vary meaningfully so it must be about the length but how would length of bar affect wave speed inside it is what im asking here and why this doesnt happen for strings ill measure and report length width and thickness of the bars if necessary
269852 im reading thomson modern particle physics and in chapter author says that the decay width of the boson is gamma pm mathrm gev he also says the total width of the decay is the sum of the partial widths gamma gamma ee gamma mu mu gamma tau tau gamma mathrm hadrons gamma nu nu gamma nu mu nu mu gamma nu tau nu tau but still am struggling to understand the language here my questions are what do we mean by the decay width why is it given in energy units instead of fraction of seconds say know these questions may sound very naive but want to make sure get the basics of the terminology
269892 the wikipedia article for venuss alleged moon neith has this picture and tantalizing remark regarding paramecia vandalism know the grey ball is supposed to be neith the white is venus the little rods are the halo of light but why is venus shaped like kidney is this supposed to be partially lit venus then why is neith never behind it
269945 we all know in physics the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant it is said to be conserved over time energy can neither be created nor destroyed rather it transforms from one form to another what happens when said energy ie planets stars light etc enter black hole does it simply change form or does it disappear from this universe into another know many physicists have said all laws start to break down once something enters black hole but are there any new theories on this is it possible it simply turns the energy into new form like dark matter
269966 dont quite understand the relationship between an objects mass acceleration and net force for example if car was going to the right at constant velocity or with no acceleration does that mean that it would have no net force from my understanding net force is directly related to acceleration as where ever the force is applied the acceleration follows can someone please explain it using better example and answer my question tried to do some research on this but cant find information pertaining to the situation have laid out
270020 today in class we were discussing the strong nuclear force and our teacher was explaining about how the strong nuclear force counteracts the repulsion force between protons in nucleus when asked about the relative strength of the two forces in question she said that the strong nuclear force is the strongest force of nature and is infinitely stronger than the repulsion force between the protons now if that were true how would the atom remain in equilibrium because if im correct equilibrium is achieved when the net force on body is zero however in this situation that doesnt seem to be the case could someone elaborate on this apparent contradiction
270030 according to the third newtons law of motion for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction so understand that if hit brick wall with mathrm lbs of force the brick wall also hits me with mathrm lbs of force usually painfully in this instance newtons third law makes sense what im confused about is if hit patch of drywall with mathrm lbs of force its probably going to break and due to the lack of pain in my hand can tell it did not hit me back with mathrm lbs of force how does newtons third law apply to situations when one object or the other is destroyed it certainly seems like at that point it is incapable of delivering the full force of my blow back to me what happens with the energy

270289 one of my friends and had an argument over this topic he stressed the fact that in real life many forces exist whereas in physics we deal only with ideal situations he put the following arguments newtons first law is invalid because friction exists in real life newtons second law is invalid due to the same reasons newtons third law is invalid because in trampoline there is excessive reaction in defence put forward the following arguments newtons laws are true but the equations have to be modified to take into account the other forces in real life for example if force is applied on body of mass and is the force of friction then the equation becomes ma thus we have just modified the equation ma so basically mean to say that we have to adjust the laws to suit our purpose in the end there was stalemate between us even now am confused after this argument please clarify my doubt
270375 stopping vehicle say car has an apparent retardation which may may not be constant in magnitude when force via brakes is applied travel by subway trains and noticed an odd phenomenon the thing about such trains might be irrelevant is that being light weight their motion somewhat mimics that of cars and the effects of motion are more apparent as one usually stands in such trains the thing noticed was that could feel force pulling me in the initial direction of motion as the train slowed down that obviously is the inertia but as soon as the train halted noticed secondary jerk this time in the opposite direction and it was kind of short lasting im curious to know what causes this secondary jerk backwards as soon as vehicle comes to rest im guessing it has something to do with the reaction force by the brakes which overcome the forward motion and provide an impulse backwards but then it has to have proper force mirror as per the third law of motion also there never is any intentional backwards motion here the drivers are precise guess so what could it really be

270600 if were to mix yellow paint which reflects yellow light and blue paint which reflects blue light would get mixture of paints that would perceive as green is that because the mixture is now reflecting green light and absorbing blue yellow or is it because both blue and yellow light is being reflected simultaneously and my visual cortex is interpreting that as green in other words are humans capable of perceiving both green frequency light as well as mixtures of colors that our brains interpret as one color shade how much of color perception is physics blue nm vs subjective brain interpretation nm nm green experimental example of my question man and man both describe laser emitting nm light as green is it possible for man to perceive mixture of two different wavelength lasers to be different color than man
270621 lets say have bucket or something bigger like bathtub full of water weigh that bath and get some value then add small boat made of wood to that bathtub that doesnt touch the borders it is only touching the water will this boat add to the total weight of the bathtub or does the weight of the tub stay the same
270982 all the youtube videos have seen on the double slit experiment broadly fall into one of the following three categories documentaries and fan made videos heavy on animation which admire the wave particle duality of light rather than explaining it university lectures where the professors draw diagrams on the board and go into the mathematics how to calculate the distance between two bright bands but never explain how the actual apparatus is built double slit diy videos on how to do the experiment with sunlight or laser but they seem to leave out the most critical part how do you make the light source so faint that only one photon is emitted at time as far as understand the classical wave theory of light fails to explain the interference only when you do the experiment with one photon at time my question here is how do you make the light source fire single particle of light at time when you are trying to determine whether or not light is made of particles in the first place am more interested in the engineering of the apparatus rather than the mathematical explanation follow up question might be how can you be sure that indeed only one photon is coming out of the source at time single photon is hitting the screen at time is not the same as single photon is coming out of the source at time especially given the weird wave particle duality
271031 why is the potential energy equals to the negative integral of force am really confused with this negative sign for example why there is negative sign in the gravitational potential energy and what does it mean read that the negative sign means you do the same force but in the opposite direction doesnt that mean the object shouldnt move
271203 background it is known that orbital motion is accelerated motion under the influence of central force and that in hydrogen atom the electron orbits the proton and is therefore accelerated and that accelerated charges emit radiation and that therefore the electron emits radiation loses energy and falls into the proton and that therefore hydrogen cannot exist the paradox is resolved by saying that classical electrodynamics alone is not an adequate description of phenomena within the atom so quantum description is required or to put it another way hydrogen exists although it oughtnt because quantum physics all this is uncontroversial but what about gravitational radiation the proton and electron form mutually gravitating system with the gravitational attraction between them being some times the electrostatic attraction like any mutually orbiting masses they must therefore emit gravitational radiation blindly following the formula in wikipedia the power radiated appears to be times watts or times ev per second dont have time to wait several times seconds to see how hydrogen atoms age so thought it would be quicker to ask here do we genuinely predict that hydrogen will emit gravitational radiation at approximately this rate or does the because quantum physics override apply to gravitational radiation just as it applies to electromagnetic radiation what would it even mean in the context of hydrogen atom where electrostatic forces predominate for the atom to lose energy by gravitational radiation how would an old atom look different from young one the absurdity of this question suggests that gravitational radiation may indeed be forbidden at the atomic level

271419 ive just started studying quantum mechanics and ive come across this correlation between pauli matrices sigma and quaternions which cant grasp namely that sigma sigma and sigma along with the 2x2 identity matrix correspond identically to the four 2x2 matrix representation of unit quaternions my first guess was that this should have something to do with quaternions being useful for representing orientations and rotations of objects in three dimensions and pauli matrices being related to the three spatial components of spin but didnt really know how to put together those two ideas google wasnt much help either the relation is mentioned for instance in this wikipedia article but no further explanation is given although suspect there is no direct answer to this question would appreciate if someone could enlighten me on the subject in particular what is the role of the factor
272599 consider this equation sin kt where is amplitude is displacement is time and is some dimensionless constant my instructor said this equation is dimensionally incorrect because the dimension of kt text and since text angles are dimensionless we can conclude that it is dimensionally incorrect dont understand why it is so why do we need to check the dimension homogeneity of the term inside the sin to conclude whether the equation is dimensionally correct or not why isnt the whole sine function is dimensionless sin kt text regardless of the dimension of the argument inside as the range of sine function is

272791 am mathematics undergraduate whos struggling to understand elementary physics the following exercise looks particularly obscure to me text kg mass lets call it is connected to text kg mass let it be through massless and inextensible rope which is bent by pulley like in the figure below need to compute the acceleration of the masses and the tension of the rope by considering two different reference frames for each mass as the picture shows worked out the following equations for the forces acting on along its axis and those acting on along its axis begin cases 1g sin circ 1a 2g 2a end cases in order to come up with this system observed that must be the same at each end of the rope because it is inextensible the same argument proves that the acceleration is the same for both masses has positive direction in both reference frames whereas 1g sin circ and 2g always have negative one hence the minus signs thought had done everything correctly but when attempted to compute and my results could not agree with those found in my book after few tries found out that the above system would yield the right solutions if only change the sign of 2a like this begin cases 1g sin circ 1a 2g color red 2a end cases this apparently agrees with the fact that from physical point of view will go downward while pulling toward the pulley my question is am supposed to know this in advance do need the knowledge of what mass is pulling the other one and where to solve the problem also have to mention that because has greater mass initially thought that would be the one sliding downward while lifting toward the pulley so tried to rewrite the first system with 1a instead of 1a leaving 2a untouched as you can guess that didnt help just want to understand why my reasoning is flawed chose the signs of 1g sin circ 2g so that they would agree with the reference frames used while had to leave 1a and 2a as they are because did not know how the system would be going to evolve yet it seems this knowledge is necessary to understand the mechanics of the two masses how is this possible
272831 in order to construct gauge invariant theory say for the electron we introduce gauge field in the lagrangian begin align mathcal bar psi gamma mu partial mu gamma mu mu psi frac mu nu mu nu end align the term bar psi mu psi seems to imply that there is always coupling between the electron and photon and therefore it seems that free electrons do not exist but in reality we do have free electrons whats wrong with my deduction
272893 the title question is rather illustrative suppose the real question would be is heat cumulative put back into an example if have lit candle right beneath an iron bar assuming the candle will remain lit indefinitely and that the heat losing rate is below the heat getting rate will the bar eventually reach the needed temperature for it to melt if the answer is no once the iron bar reached the max temp the candle can get it to where does all of the energy heat go after edit the question is heat cumulative can be ignored as it is out of place and is misleading althrough the answer for it is yes it doesnt mean the answer for the general question is also yes the point is not if it is actually possible to melt iron with candle iron and candle are mere parts of the illustration their properties are irrelevant better phrasing of the main question would be could heating object contained in perfectly closed system push the temperature of the system above its own temperature
272918 this might be stupid question but im newbie to physics an object less dense than water or any other fluid but im going to use water for this example floats normally on earth when placed in water but if the object was placed in hypothetical place where there is no gravity and there is air it would not float on water so if the object was placed in water on planet with more gravity than earth would it float more or would it float less or float the same as on earth would it float more because it doesnt float without gravity but it does float with earth gravity therefore itd float even more with more gravity or would it float less because more gravity would pull the object down so it wont float as much or would itd float the exact same as on earth because the above two scenarios cancel each other out edit by float more mean it rises to the surface of the water faster and it takes more force to push it down by float less mean it rises to the surface of the water slower and it takes less force to push it down
273006 the following are facts of the prevailing cosmological model the age of the universe is about billion years nothing with mass can exceed the speed of light the diameter of the observable universe is gigaparsecs billion light years how could two particles never exceeding miles per second ever end up farther than light years apart is it possible to explain this seeming contradiction in way that appeals to reason and doesnt require pencil and paper
273076 weight is force force is mass acceleration when im standing motionless on the scale how do have weight greater than mathrm when my mass is mathrm kg and my acceleration is mathrm kg mathrm mathrm edit thanks inquisitive for showing me that the acceleration component of force need not be explicit and allowing me to understand this concept of weight logically and mathematically weigh 200lbs 8m is 152ft 200lbs 22slugs about 90kg 90kg 8m 882n about 200lbs my explicit acceleration of is irrelevant to this equation the magnitude of gravitational acceleration is the correct acceleration to use in this figure the word acceleration caused the misconception that something would be visually observable namely movement
273160 came across the concept of significant figures through physics books not math books surprisingly know the rules of them and they are trivial but why physicists care much about them why the topic is introduced in physics textbooks at the beginning while in typical calculus or linear algebra textbooks there is nothing regarding significant figures even though numbers are critical in determining for example solution for linear system or domain of function in calculus can any one show case where ignoring significant figures can lead to catastrophic consequences
273218 was trying to simulate two serpentine resistors on comsol multiphysics with exactly the same length width and thickness drew them on autocad the only difference between the two resistors is the number of bends for resistor1 number of bends is only while for resistor2 number of bends is after running simulation on ac dc module and electric currents ec sub module resistance values came as the following resistor1 ohm number of bends resistor2 ohm number of bends expected that the number of bends will not affect the resistance value but it actually does in an inverse manner though not much but it does is anyone aware why would the number of bends affect the resistance value simulation parameters resistor1 length 337mm width 1mm thickness 2mm number of bends resistor2 length 337mm width 1mm thickness 2mm number of bends meshing resolution extra fine minimum element size 18mm maximum element size 2mm maximum element growth rate curvature factor resolution of narrow regions effect of meshing resolution on resistance values
273224 from my old studies in signals can remember that signal limited in frequency domain is unlimited in time domain and viceversa signal limited in time domain is unlimited in frequency domain so if take window over sinusoidal signal the result is that we change the pure frequency domain to domain with other frequencies well how do those extra frequencies sound so in practice the limited signal will be some set of frequencies centered around the main frequency want to know how does that sound when removing the frequencies nearest to the main frequency but leaving all others im asking for approximate sound of you are allowed to shift those frequencies and to normalize the amplitude in order to bring them into an audible range edit im not sampling sinus wave in limited time but sampling it in long time with limited signal in example if accidentally this question helps to find way to syntethize some kind of noise highly doubt but it will be already covered by stackexchange contents license
273272 for the definition of the momentum operator hat hbar nabla in quantum mechanics as understand you can derive this by either considering more general definition of momentum canonical momentum which is an operator and then apply this operator to wave functions this is shown here in this wiki entry we can alternatlively start with translations and use the face that the momentum operator is generator of translations as is done here in this wiki entry what am interested in is what is the more fundamental derivation for the position operator hat to this point have considered that the motivation for defining position operator is from the definition of the expectation value langle rangle int dx psix langle psi psi rangle where psi rangle is normalised is this the full extent of the motivation or the main point to consider is there another motivation for the position operator or is it taken from this motivation and confirmed by experiments to be acceptable
273780 im fairly new to the subject of quantum field theory qft and im having trouble intuitively grasping what point correlation function physically describes for example consider the point correlation function between real scalar field hat phi and itself at two different space time points and langle hat phi hat phi rangle langle rvert lbrace hat phi hat phi rbrace lvert rangle tag where time orders the fields does this quantify the correlation between the values of the field at mathbf and mathbf how much the values of the field at different space time points covary in the sense that if the field hat phi is excited at time at some spatial point mathbf then this will influence the behaviour of the field at later time at some spatial point mathbf is this why it is referred to as correlation function furthermore does one interpret as physically describing the amplitude of propagation of phi particle from to in the sense that correlation of excitations of the field at two points and can be interpreted as ripple in the field propagating from to
273852 the perseid meteor shower is caused by debris left behind comet swift tutte my understanding is that the meteor shower occurs once per year because thats when the earth passes near the orbital path of the comet my question is why this shower only occurs once per year im imagining that the earth has an elliptical orbit around the sun as does the comet if the comets orbit intersects the earths orbit at some point since theyre both ellipses would have thought that there would be at least two intersection points with the earths orbit which would mean that wed see this meteor shower twice or four times in the year as the earth passes through these intersection points im assuming theres something wrong with my reasoning can anyone clarify this for me

273964 standard textbooks introduce special relativity in this way they introduce two postulates the second being something like that the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of the motion of the light source consenus definition on the english wikipedia page or light is always propagated in empty space with definite velocity speed which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body einstein they define einstein synchronisation which relies on the knowledge assumption that the speed of light is everywere constant the problem that see is this one the postulate is speaking about any measure of speed and the meaning of mean speed is supposed to be delta delta as far as the reader knows where delta and being two measured times if the times and are measured in two different positions we need to know in advance how to syncronise distant clocks but we dont know yet and we will know how to do it only afterwards with einstein synchronisation but einstein syncronisation relies on the postulate itself it assumes that the speed of light is constant this seems to produce logical circularity speed of light is obviously constant just because we define synchronisation in order to make it artificially constant and what is the postulate actually telling us we dont know what is speed yet since we dont know how to define time for spatially distant places maybe the postulate is supposed to be linked with einstein synchronisation in order to define what is speed what actually is speed velocity on general non circular path when we drop absolute time before postulating anything about speed of light we need in the first place to know what speed is and the definition shouldnt rely on the use of the notion of velocity itself that is the case with einsteins synchronisation can anyone clarify this issue know the experiment proved that speed of light is constant when measured as an average in closed path with mirrors but would say it doesnt say anything about the speed of light in any non closed interval of the path
274070 lets work with the eigenvectors rangle sqrt sqrt text and rangle suppose measure and find our state vector is rangle if spin is angular momentum that means the vector points in the positive direction if then measure will find it either in rangle or rangle this seems contradictory we just determined the vector is aligned with the axis but now find it is aligned with the axis should we not really think of spin angular momentum as vector pointing along an axis and if not how should we think of it

274167 recently ive been looking through some physic articles and found some equations of relativity in those articles it was said that the relative mass varies depending on whether its moving or not so if object is moving really fast it has more mass than resting object the thing is since we are moving through the universe at really high velocity could we say that the mass we can measure is actually higher than our real mass is the mass we can measure our real mass or should we use any equation to get it
274226 im having issues deriving the dirac adjoint equation overline psi gamma mu partial mu tag started by taking the hermitian adjoint of all components of the original dirac equation giving me psi dagger gamma mu dagger partial mu dagger tag the adjoint of the gamma matrices is defined to be gamma mu dagger gamma gamma mu gamma so no issues there now intuitively would think that the adjoint of the gradient would be partial mu dagger partial mu in non relativistic quantum mechanics it can be shown that first derivative operators are anti hermitian so for example frac dx dagger frac dx so would think this would the same case for the gradient but apparently it isnt among the many derivations ive gone over for example on page here it claims that the gradient is self adjoint could someone please explain why my intuition is incorrect
274227 as the main title says im finding myself wondering about helicopters the tail rotor is vulnerable and key piece of equipment especially on military helicopters know some helicopters instead use two main rotors for example the ka why not use reaction wheel the main engine could power the wheel and it could be placed in an armored area and less vulnerable to fragmentation munition is it because any reaction wheel would be prohibitively large

274492 im currently using nadri jeevanjees book on group theory for physicists to understand quantum mechanics came across these two pages that left me stuck example su2 and so3 in most physics textbooks the relationship between so3 and su2 is described in terms of the infinitesimal generators of these groups we will discuss infinitesimal transformations in the next section and make contact with the standard physics presentation then here we present the relationship in terms of group homomorphism rho su2 to so3 defined as follows consider the vector space check of all times2 traceless anti hermitian matrices denoted as mathfrak su for reasons we will explain later you can check that an arbitrary element in mathfrak su can be written as frac12 begin pmatrix iz ix ix iz end pmatrix quad xyz in mathbb tag if we take as basis vectors begin align frac i2 sigma frac12 begin pmatrix end pmatrix frac i2 sigma frac12 begin pmatrix end pmatrix frac i2 sigma frac12 begin pmatrix end pmatrix end align then we have xs so the column vector corresponding to in the basis mathcal is begin pmatrix end pmatrix note that det frac14 leftx right frac14 so the determinant of in mathfrak su is proportional to the norm squared of in mathbb with the usual euclidean metric now you will check below that in su2 acts on in mathfrak su by the map mapsto axa dagger and that this map is linear thus this map is linear operator on mathfrak su and can be represented in the basis mathcal by times matrix which we will call rhoa so that axa dagger rhoa where rhoa acts on by the usual matrix multiplication furthermore left rhoa right left axa dagger right detaxa dagger det left right tag so that rhoa preserves the norm of this implies see exercise below that rhoa in o3 and one can in fact show13 that det rhoa so that rhoa in so3 thus we may construct map begin align rho su2 to so3 mapsto rhoa end align furthermore rho is homomorphism since begin align rhoab left abxab dagger right left ab dagger dagger right rhoa left bxb dagger right rhoa rhob tag end align and hence rhoab rhoa rhob is rho an isomorphism one can show14 that rho is onto but not one to one and in fact has kernel from the discussion preceding this example we then know that rhoa rho forall in su2 this fact is also clear from the definition of rho so for every rotation in so3 there correspond exactly two matrices in su2 which map to under rho thus when trying to implement rotation on spin particle we have two choices for the su2 matrix we use and it is sometimes said that the map rho is double valued in mathematical terms one does not usually speak of functions with multiple values though so instead we say that su2 is the double cover of so3 since the map rho is onto cover and two to one double have the following questions have previously been introduced to the process of diagonalizing matrices what dont understand is in this case what is being diagonalized or is the final matrix in so3 or su2 does this diagonalization process correspond to change of basis and if it does whats the point of changing bases what mapping corresponds to being represented as vector in the basis xs ys also just dont understand what the to mapping means also understand that is lie algebra and to find its lie group you have to exponentiate it ive read in math book that this process also involves diagonalization but just dont understand the whole process and the relationship between lie algebras and lie groups why is there need to switch between the two
274858 according to this article muon decays into one electron and two neutrinos according to this article elementary particles or fundamental particles are particles whose substructure is unknown thus it is unknown whether it is composed of other particles have also seen somewhere that it is particle that cannot be reduced into other constituent particles while perhaps not sure thing seems like the decay indicates that the muon may be just composite particle perhaps consisting of one electron and two neutrinos based on this why does the muon fit with the above definition of an elementary or fundamental particle realize there are much more complicated historical reasons as to why it was included in the standard model but this question is just related so how it fits or doesnt fit the stated definition above it seems to me that we really can only get solid evidence of elementary vs composite when we smash the particles together and see what comes out and compare that to all the masses energies and momentum before and after until we do that with muons how can we know with much certainty and perhaps well have better answer with muon collider http en wikipedia org wiki muon collider http map fnal gov to that point seems that electrons may not be fundamental after all https www sciencedaily com releases htm
274930 while looking at the metrics of different spacetimes came across the ellis wormhole with the following metric 2d tau 2dt sigma where sigma rho rho 2d omega note that the temporal term has constant coefficient the wikipedia article mentions there being no gravity in force an inertial observer test particle can sit forever at rest at any point in space but if set in motion by some disturbance will follow geodesic of an equatorial cross section at constant speed as would also photon this phenomenon shows that in space time the curvature of space has nothing to do with gravity the curvature of time one could say so this metric would not result in any gravitational effects looking at the schwarzschild metric 2d tau frac 2dt frac dr 2d theta sin theta phi here we have non constant coeffcient for the first component and this metric clearly has an attractive effect on particles its geodesics have the tendency towards rightarrow0 does that mean the gravitational effect comes primarily from curvature of time and not from spatial curvature assume part of the answer has to do with the motion through time being dominant for all but the fastest particles is the spatial curvature the primary cause of the visual distortion the bending of light paths in these metrics im getting the picture that temporal curvature primarily affects objects moving fast through time static and slow objects and spatial curvature primarily affects objects moving fast through space photons is this good picture or completely wrong if the spacetime around an ellis wormhole is purely spatial does that mean the faster move through space the more would feel the attraction and also second order effects like tidal forces are there physical metrics valid solutions for the efe which only have temporal curvature but no spatial curvature would such an object behave like source of gravity without the gravitational lensing if such objects would be valid would that mean you could pass them unharmed or even unnoticed at high speeds moving fast through space but would be ripped to pieces if you are moving slowly moving fast through time
275032 understand how to derive the spacetime interval being invariant for minkowski space but ive never seen any derivation of it in general curved spacetime is the invariance just derived for minkowski space and then postulated that it holds for all metric tensors in general relativity or is there proof to show it is invariant in general relativity

275219 if you stand on the top of falling ladder you will hit the ground at higher speed and therefore presumedly sustain more injury if you hold on to the ladder than if you jump off it this was solved here where is the break even height on the ladder from where you will hit the ground with the same speed if you jump off it or if you follow it down this question just makes an assumption that you would hit the ground more softly if you stay on to the ladder compared to jumping off it if you are located at the lower part of it dont think the midpoint is the break even point quickly calculated and think you should stay on the ladder if you are on its midpoint the following is just quick computation there could be errors in it midpoint frac gl frac frac frac and are the respective masses of man and ladder is the length of the ladder
275271 if you raise an object you increase its absolute value potential energy but if you exceed an specific height suddenly the gravity cant pull over the object and it can be interpreted as the potential is turned to zero the intuition of potential energy is how much energy it can be released if you let the object go does this mean that the potential energys function is discontinuous guess not but why its against my intuition

275363 in classical physics particles and fields are completely different stuff however when field is quantized the particles appear as its excitations photon appears as field excitation in the quantization of electromagnetic field in fact for all the elementary particles there is corresponding field am interested whether this is also true for any composite particles could we define for any given composite particle field for which upon quantization that composite particle appears as its excitation is there for example anything like hydrogen atom field
275604 this question is inspired by two other similar so far unanswered questions posed by different ops mass sits on incline with angle theta that provides just enough friction for it not to start sliding down it is connected by massless string and perfect spring with hookean spring constant to mass pulley is frictionless at the spring is not extended at all then is released question what is the minimum to cause movement of up the incline attempt ignore the spring determine static coefficient mu first begin align 2g sin theta mu 2g cos theta implies mu tan theta end align to overcome the 2g component parallel to the inclined and the friction begin align 1g gt mu 2g cos theta 2g sin theta implies gt 2m sin theta end align but apparently this overestimates it has to be taken into account that starts accelerating before starts moving because of the spring but how like several other members cant see how the work done on the spring affects the minimum conservation of energy

275669 in spite of their different dimensions the numerical values of pi and in si units are surprisingly similar frac pi approx after some searching thought that this fact isnt coincidence but an inevitable result of the definition of metre which was possibly once based on pendulum with one second period however the definition of metre has changed and is no longer related to pendulum which is reasonable as varies from place to place but pi approx still holds true after this vital change this confused me is pi approx coincidence my question isnt about numerology and dont think the similarity between the constant pi and of the planet we live on reflects divine power or anything alike consider it the outcome of the definitions of si units this question is as jay and norbertschuch pointed out in their comments below mainly about units and somewhat related to the history of physics
275711 recently have heard of extensions of the double slit experiment that propose to use bacterium as the particle ive also heard that the double slit experiment in principle would still show an interference pattern if it were done with human or car as long as there is no observer this made me wonder if this is true and exist in superposition do have mass which exists in several locations at the same time and with an associated weight of 200lbs in each of my superposition locations if that were true and fact wouldnt that account for the missing mass which we attribute to dark matter also even if on some other level this is true about particles only wouldnt this be where we would find link between quantum mechanics and gravity linking it with relativity forgive me if this is silly question as am almost years old and have been almost years out of school but just love to read and think about science and learn as much as can

275830 have been struggling recently with comprehensive problem on the relationship between topological superconductor and topological order my question originates from reading work conducted by prof wen http arxiv org abs also previous answered question do topological superconductors exhibit symmetry enriched topological order in which prof wens comment also deals lot with my questions presented below it has been claimed that 1d topological superconductor is case of 1d fermionic topological order or more strictlly speaking symmetry enriched topological order my understanding on topological order is that it is characterized by topological degeneracy which is degenrate ground states roubust to any local perturbation and in the paper it is argued that 1d topological superconductor is such fermionic topological order with fermion parity symmetry breaking so far have learned about one dimensional or maybe its quasi one dimensional as you like topological superconductor the first case where we have detected the appearance of majorana zero modes is 1d class topological superconductor and the terminology on class is defined from classification working with bdg symmetry class of hamiltonian and class means such 1d superconductor possesses only particle hole symmetry phs xi and based on kitaevs theory jobs the topological invatiant is mathbb in non trivial topological phase labeled with topological number nu majorana zero mode appears at each end of 1d class topological superconductor and under my comprehension the two majorana zero modes form two fold degenracte ground states rangle rangle with different fermion parity and in fermionic system like superconductor the hamiltonian has fermion parity symmetry hence the actual ground state configuration just dont have such symmetry from hamiltonian and therefore spontaneous breaks it however why it should be claimed that such breaking just directly leads to the appearance of 1d fermionic topological order in this 1d topological superconductor regarding to the original words in the paper two fold topological degeneracy is nothing but the two fold degeneracy of the symmetry breaking and prof wen in that previous posted question also said that this kind of 1d fermionic topological order state is therefore the result of long range entanglementlre so majorana chain is indeed lre and kitaev has just used another way with out local unitary transformation definitionlu to describe topological order so want ask how should one treat such open line 1d majorana chain as long range entanglement quantum state and what about describing it with lu definition how should people be supposed to demonstrate that and the last but also the most important question which makes me quite confused is that it seems like all 1d topological superconductors regardless of what class or what symmetry they have are 1d fermionic topological order state due to the appearance of topological degeneracy which so far in here considered as majorana zero modes well at least in the paper mentioned above it is about two fold topological degeneracy and in 1d class topological superconductor it is toplogical robust to what perturbation it has no trs nor chiral symmetry at all dont know how to discuss the trs breaking influence on this two fold degeneracy and fine assume it is indeed robust to any local perturbation then lets consider another case the 1d diii class topological superconductor with trs theta and according to kramers theorem each end has pair of time reverse counterpart of majorana zero modes majorana doublet which forms four fold degenracy after we introduce trs breaking perturbation zeeman field the majorana doublet is lifted and splits finite energy level have read the references physrevb as well as physrevlett and dont know whether have got it correctly or not so in these works found words claim that such four fold degenracy is trs topological protected does that imply this kind of 1d toplogical superconductor has actually no topological degenracy with majorana zero modes since it needs symmetry protection and therefore should belongs to spt rather then set if it is yes then does it mean not all 1d topological superconductors are topological order but just those with two fold degenarcy may belong to topological order if not then where did actually get wrong id appreciate every helpful comments and replys thank you
276251 if use van de graff generator to pump electrons into deflated balloon eventually negative charge will start to build up inside the balloon assume the mouth of the balloon is sealed so air can not enter or exit the balloon the electrons will push against each other and from my understanding build up mostly along the inner surface of the balloon will these electrons push against the sides of the balloon strongly enough to inflate the balloon or will this whole setup be impossible for some reason am not seeing like the electrons drifting through the balloon walls too quickly to build up assume the balloon is as thick as necessary edit was imagining that as more and more electrons are pumped in some would start colliding with the walls of the balloon these constant collisions with the balloon walls would cause pressure outward on the walls of the balloon the same way air molecules colliding with balloon walls creates pressure why would the balloon not just inflate like it does with air after the relatively small amount of pressure required to inflate balloons is reached agree the pressure to add electrons would raise quickly but that leads me to think it would inflate with fairly few electrons added edit sorry for the follow up questions am by no means claiming the balloon would inflate just dont understand why air would work and electrons would not if the balloon wall absorbs some electrons wont it become negatively charged quite quickly and then directly feel repulsive force with the other walls of the balloon and the still free electrons then it would inflate by direct force instead of the indirect collisions of the electrons on its walls edit thank you for all of the interest in this question due to some questions in comments will provide some clarification details after reading observations from count to hames large and marty green regarding hot vs cold electrons see the experiment as the following diagram the environment outside the balloon this could either be air or vacuum so long as the entire experiment could fit inside modern vacuum chamber the interior of the balloon marked in red as ulthran pointed out this would essentially be vacuum with possibly some electrons drifting around the top ball of van de graff generator andrea di biagio pointed out that we have to be careful to not let all the charge accumulate in one spot normally the ball at the top would be flat but here there are points attached to help the electrons discharge from the ball in more or less uniform pattern this design is from my limited knowledge of van de graff generators please feel free to suggest something else if there is better way to move cold electrons into the balloon here is the mouth of the balloon this is somehow firmly attached to the pole of the van de graff generator with highly insulating material the goal is that the electrons will not move to the pole and air will not be able to enter the balloon and electrons will not be able to exit think andrea di biagio is the closest to definite answer so far the calculation arrived at about electrons required to generate enough pressure thanks to rotsor for some calculation adjustments so the question is can we fit this many electrons inside the balloon turns out they all end up on the inside wall of the balloon or will something happen to stop this for example leaking through the balloon wall dielectric breakdown rubber chemical bonds breaking or something else
276405 my understanding is that dark surfaces are better than bright surfaces at radiating and absorbing heat but if you have bright shiny surface like metal house radiator and you then paint it black the colour of the shiny surface still exists underneath the black paint the new black surface may be better at radiating the heat but the heat still has to be transferred from the shiny surface to the black paint before it can be radiated from the black paint surely adding any layer to the outside of radiator will reduce its ability to radiate heat if you get two empty tins bean tins with silvered surfaces inside and out then paint the outside of one of them matt black then fill both with boiling water and pop lid on with thermometer in each and observe the rates of temperature decline you will notice that the black tin cools at faster rate dont understand why the heat is now transferring faster through the silvered metal of the blackened tin before it even reaches the black paint why is this
276574 have seen and understood the classical thought experiment where you imagine light clock sending light ray between two mirrors while moving in perpendicular direction to the lights direction in the reference frame of the clock as shown here what dont understand is that the formula for an observers perceived time delta of the clock is derived from the pythagorean theorem which only works because the light is being reflected in direction perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the clock from the clocks point of view if the clock reflected the light in the same direction as it was itself moving that is in the animation above the clock would be flipped degrees laying down then it would still be clock because it would still have fixed period but dont see how one would derive the same result for how bystander perceives the clock delta dfrac delta sqrt am asking this because in the example ive seen of length contraction the clock was moving in the same direction as the light was being reflected but in the derivation of the equation of the contraction effect they still used the formula for time dilation which was derived when the clock was standing as in the animation above
276724 heat is just form of kinetic energy for molecules because as temperature rises the heated molecules are shake and vibrate more and more but how does that show up on quantum scale what element actually carries the kinetic energy the heated molecule as whole its atoms the nuclei or the electrons orbits maybe even the quarks found in the nuclei or is it that the shaking described is only an analogy for notion of energy that is more difficult to grasp as their is no real physical movement in the heated object

277347 am aware that there appear to be many similar questions on this site but that is just because of the misleading title could not think of better title that illustrates how different is this question so if you could fix it thank you very much my knowledge of physics comes down to kinematics and newtons laws would like to get answers which do not deviate from this basic knowledge am currently questing for exact definitions of work and energy and what is behind these definitions searched in physics sites and here in physics in particular but have not found satisfactory answer here is list of the main resources have reviewed over the net https en wikipedia org wiki energy http www energyquest ca gov story chapter01 html https www reference com science work physics a310b0a21e7039a5 http www edinformatics com math science work energy power htm here on physics intuitively understanding work and energy why does kinetic energy increase quadratically not linearly with speed understanding relationship between work and energy relationship between work and energy in an electrostatic system to preface my question will explain the process went through until got my current understanding which want to sharpen first here are the main definitions of work and energy found around the web energy is property or state of objects representing the ability to do work it can be transferred to other objects and it can be reflected in many forms which are convertible work is transfer of energy from one object to another by applying force and it is equal to vec cdot vec for constant force or to int vec enspace vec for changing force these definitions seem circular because work is transfer of energy and energy is the ability to do work to solve this problem adopted neurofuzzys approach sometimes when youre stuck on things its helpful to look at the mathematics of whats being asserted basic mathematical analysis of work definition vec cdot vec raises the following two points when multiplying the force or the displacement by the work is also multiplied by for example if apply force of vec on an object the work will be twice as big as if applied force of vec also if given force on an object led to frac vec displacement the work it did is twice as smaller as in case it led to vec displacement force does positive work when the object displaces the force on the object is in the direction of the displacement force does negative work when the object displaces the force on the object is in the opposite direction of the displacement force does no work when the object does not displace no force is applied to the displacement axis both of these conditions are met in other words when apply force on an object in certain circumstances environment other forces time period etc and the objects displacement is different than the displacement in the same conditions only without the force could say that the force has influenced the displacement it can have positive influence if the displacement was larger than the displacement under the same conditions without applying the force or have negative influence if the displacement was smaller than the displacement under the same conditions without applying the force if applied force and the displacement was equal to the displacement under the same conditions without applying the force then the force did not influence the displacement my intuitive conclusion of this analysis is that work is the degree of influence force has on an objects displacement if we accept my definition and we combine it with the definitions above we could describe work and energy as follows energy is property or state of objects representing the ability to apply force that will influence an objects displacement it can be transferred to other objects and it can be reflected in many forms which are convertible work is the degree of influence force has on an objects displacement when force does work besides the fact that it moves the object it also transfers to the object the ability to influence other objects displacement by applying force have few questions about these definitions cannot find an answer do not know whether the definitions are correct and the questions have answers and then will be grateful for answers or the definitions are incorrect in the first place and then will be grateful if you could correct my definitions here are the questions does the definition of energy mean that all energy is potential energy because if energy describes the capability of an object to do work doesnt it means that we are talking about the potential of the object to do work defined energy as property or state of an object representing the amount of work it can do but how could we quantify it if for example man stores within itself 100j of energy does that mean he is able to apply force of over surely human being is not capable of applying so much force so why we still say he stores 100j how potential energy is reflected while being potential can we see difference between person that stores energy and person consuming that energy an answer heard lot is that the mass of the person is actually its potential energy and therefore doing physical activities for example is consuming energy and reducing the mass but if it is correct wouldnt we measure energy in kg or mass in joule although my definitions do explain the inner nature of work and energy could still mathematically describe this nature in an infinite number of ways for example if describe work as vec cdot vec would still get to the conclusion that work is the influence force has on an objects displacement so why is that the equation how is consuming energy in other forms than motion work how are heat energy or sound waves for example work thanks
277512 am new to string theory ive read that string theory is an important theory because it is good candidate for unified theory of all forces it is better than the standard model of particle physics because it included gravity so is this the importance of string theory to unify all forces or there are other features that make it good theory edit am not asking for complete explanation of the theory im just trying to understand its importance conceptually not mathematically as starting point to hence start exploring its details

278628 im having some trouble with the following problem charge is placed on the body diagonal of the cube very close to one of the corners distance delta from the corner delta tending to zero of the base of the cube not on the corner though what is the electric flux associated with this charge on the base of the cube through the entire cube the flux will undoubtedly be frac epsilon but since the charge is not symmetrically located with respect to any of the face the flux associated should be different for each face tried to make out small cube whose body diagonal is delta in this small cube the flux will be frac epsilon and the charge is also symmetrically located however cannot figure out the portion of the flux of the smaller cube that will actually pass through the base of the bigger cube one part of the flux will obviously be frac epsilon from the base of smaller cube but what about flux contributions of other parts of the smaller hypothetical cube on the base of the bigger original cube notethere has been some misconceptions regarding this question what the questions asks about is not to find out the flux as function of delta but to find out the flux as delta approaches zero however one thing should be kept in mind delta is not zero and is finite
278664 the question is short if charge or mass distribution rho is enclosed by surface can calculate the electrostatic or gravitational potential on that surface by integrating rhor for each point on now if want to use only the potential distribution on to calculate the potential on another surface which also encloses rho and could enclose be enclosed by or intersect is it solvable will the solution be unique and is there name for this calculation can use to read further if you are feeling generous you might even outline how to do it have hunch it means putting surface at large where the higher order multipoles go to zero but am not sure an example of this would be to propagate gravitational potential model of the earth on one surface to another surface where both surfaces enclose the earth without necessarily trying to find solutions for the mass distribution within the earth as an intermediate step above illustration of one of the three cases here intersects the rest was added in order to show some effort in order to remove the previous hold here is what do understand so far ill plot 2d problem for easier display can define three charge or mass distributions such that the total density is non negative newtons shell theorem tells us that for potential in dimensions outside of the distribution the result is the same for extended superimposed spherical distributions or point chargers locs locations rs radii of distributions rhos density of distributions qs rho fourpi for rho in ziprhos rs equivalent point charges note want to solve the 3d problem where newtons shell theorem applies the 2d plots here are simply to help illustrate where am at the moment plotting the external potential and the density distribution can define two boundaries at and and calculate the potential on those boundaries could also choose an orthogonal set of basis functions such as spherical harmonics for spherical boundary in 3d and just fourier series for circular boundary in 2d shown below now suppose only have the potential on the enclosing boundary of charge free region in that case the potential in that region is the solution of laplaces equation and it is completely defined and unique there are several ways to find it set of basis functions could be fit but ill do it the easy way the jacobi method numerical technique where in the case of 2d square grid you calculate an array of the averages of the four nearest neighbors and then update the whole array with the new numbers it is slow and there are several ways to speed it up but ill just use the simplest form here iterating thousands of times with the simplest slowest algorithm know shouldnt use jet cf here and here however my question is about how to handle the situation where you have the potential on one circular or spherical boundary the reason showed the fourier transform above is to suggest that all higher order terms drop rapidly with radius and so it may be possible that can at least have second boundary at very large and know that the potential is just tot as goes to infinity so have feeling that could come in handy so have three cases encloses is enclosed by or intersects in some straightforward way what are the techniques and assumptions need in order to solve for the potential on given the potential on without having to go back and generate some solution for the generating mass or charge distribution again are all or any of the three cases solvable above illustration of one of the three cases here intersects

278870 according to special relativity photon traveling at the speed of light does not experience time it is traveling into the future at an infinite rate right that would mean that everything that could ever happen my death trump winning the election death of sun end of the universe has already happened from the frame of photon were just too slow to experience this is this correct because that would bring some weird implications about free will and the very nature of our existence if everything has already happened then were just following predetermined path edit im genuinely fascinated by this topic however am also an idiot with very superficial knowledge gained mostly from youtube videos and wikipedia bear that in mind edit the nature of my question seems to leave the realm of physics and cross into philosophical issue was seeking physical explanation to help answer something of philosophical nature as both these realms seem to coincide for this particular topic some have pointed out that thinking about the frame of photon doesnt make sense instead one could assume spaceship traveling at 9999c

279119 in superstring theory the spacetime dimension is either one of them is time the rest are spatial dimensions but based on geometrical argument we can say that propto where is the space dimension so that means if spatial dimensions are more than according to string theory then gravity will decay as propto or more ive read the description of how superstring handles it here string and superstring theory really theory see http en wikipedia org wiki theory and http en wikipedia org wiki string theory extra dimensions require minimum of spatial dimensions if those or some of those are big dimensions then the weakness of gravity might be explained and then if we then look at smaller and smaller distances gravity is relatively stronger it is also one reason there are attempts to measure the strength of gravity at smaller and smaller distances to see if it does not go as so far as said above its only been down to about millimeter and nothing strange has been found string theory mostly has it because the strings that cause gravity were thought to be able to extend in all dimensions whereas normal forces like nuclear and electromagnetism strings are constrained to move in our 3d brane that gravity propagates in the spatial dimensions string theory also assumed that the other dimensions are small microscopic and we cant see them then you need to calculate how much it dilutes gravity but some string theory developments assume or more large extra dimensions and then it dilutes and gets relatively stronger in the much smaller domain my question is how can this ever be possible that the gravity varies as propto at small distance but propto at large distance there must be at some point where these two meets and at those points gravitational forces values are not unique and not continuous how can this be how does string theory or any theories explain this
279394 in an atom or even an oscillating circuit when an electron falls from higher energy level to lower one it gives photon of energy hf on other hand it can be considered as an accelerated decelerated charged particle that make an electromagnetic radiation which moves vertical to the path of acceleration but in first explanation we have photon that goes into the vacuum and does not lose energy over distance but in latter explanation we have an electromagnetic wave that diminishes by the ratio of how do you interpret this discrepancy am sure am making mistake somewhere

280725 ive studied quantum mechanics and know the usual answer the dimension of the hilbert space is the maximum number of linear independent states the system can be found in there is something about this statement that bothers me let me try to explain it imagine particle whose dynamics satisfy schrodinger equation before we give it hamiltonian in principle the particle can have any square integrable continuous function as state when we write particular hamiltonian we find the actual eigenstates of the particle and then every possible state is linear combination of that eigenstates now acording to the first definition of the hilbert space it has all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian now several questions arise does the hamiltonian determine the hilbert space what if make two particles with diferent hamiltonians interact do they live in diferent hilbert spaces what about perturbation theory do change the hilbert space each time add new term in the hamiltonian now tend to think that the hilbert space contains every possible state of the particle whether it is solution of the schrodinger equation or not please help me sort this problem out

281483 is there any substance with segments of its phase change diagram lines going in negative direction to explain generally as phase change diagrams go with heat increasing and pressure constant substances tend to evaporate sublimate or melt cooling produces the opposite fusion freezing deposit or condensation into liquid from vapor but the diagrams are rarely straightforward water for example has multitude of forms of ice where not all forms are obtainable through transitions from any direction there are many obscure factors that define when each transition can occur is there any substance that without transforming into another substance say polymerization possesses an area of the phase change diagram possibly way off room conditions where the transition goes in the opposite direction heating leads to not necessarily more dense but more solid state something like thermally hardened glue but without chemical transition
281660 its common understanding that atoms emit or absorb light when the energy of the photons is equal to the the difference in the energy levels in the atom what dont understand is how does an electron absorb light inside an atom is it that the atom as whole absorbs light or the individual electrons absorb the light packets also would like to know what does one mean when you say that an electron absorbs photon how does an electron absorb photon
281667 know this may sound weird but could photon be given mass and if so what would the effects be

282286 so ive been trying to teach myself about quantum computing and found great youtube series called quantum computing for the determined however why do we use ket bra notation normal vector notation is much clearer okay clearer because ive spent couple of weeks versus two days with it but still is there any significance to this notation im assuming its used for reason but what is that reason guess just dont understand why youd use ket notation when you have perfectly good notation already
282459 this may be basic question but have never understood it completely why is an earthed conductor always at zero potential would say it is because theoretically one can suck up charge from the earth without doing work hence it is at zero potential all earth charge is at infinity not sure if this makes sense
282745 if light is faster in vacuum medium than in air medium does it mean that we are seeing everything in delayed manner since we live in air medium is there any way to see things in actual speed in vacuum im not physics grad so im sorry if my question is trivial
283274 was reading this article which introduces the delta function as general sequence of integrable functions if displaystyle int infty infty gx mathrm dx where gx could be any function that gives finite value for then displaystyle lim gamma to infty gamma gamma deltax using this definition the authors claim that the value of delta function is not necessarily infinite at because we can choose gx in way that g0 now for white or gaussian noise lets call it zetat the correlation function is defined as langle zetat zetat prime rangle deltat prime which can be understood in an intuitive way as stating that the noise is uncorrelated for different times and has strength of what happens to this correlation function if we choose the delta generating sequence of functions so that delta0 should we just give meaning to this type of correlation functions involving delta only when they are inside an integral and if its the case then assume we want to integrate this correlation from to then upon using different sequences of functions to produce delta the final result of the integration may be different

284121 if an electron would otherwise be moving at the speed of light if it werent constantly interacting with the higgs field how is conservation of momentum preserved if its constantly bouncing off of virtual higgs bosons why does this not lead to particles like electrons experiencing brownian motion from all the random collisions

284444 given plancks energy frequency relation hf since energy is quantized presumably there exists some quantum of energy that is the smallest possible is there truly such universally minimum quantum of and does that also mean that there is minimum possible frequency and thus maximum possible wavelength
284450 what is the difference between functional and an operator when we define an operator in physics the momentum operator as hat frac dx it is said this operator acts on the wave functions but isnt something that takes function as an argument also called functional why do we call hat momentum operator and not momentum functional
284724 when an observer causes the wave function of particle to collapse how can we know that the wave function was not collapsed already before the measurement suppose we measure the component of the spin of an electron after the measurement it is entirely aligned along the measured direction the direction before the measurement we need to assume that probability distribution proportional to psi of the two allowed directions is present if we repeat the measurement with many identically prepared electrons we should see such distribution finally for example we could measure spin down and spin up however it seems we could also assume that all of these particles have defined spin direction before we measure them what is an intuitive being aware that quantum phenomena as such are rarely intuitive explanation for why we cannot simply assume that the spin was already aligned completely in that measured direction with regards to the suggestion that this two year old question is duplicate of the one asked yesterday would like to point out that my question isnt limited to entanglement but asks about very fundamental principle in quantum mechanics and as such is not duplicate
284896 this is purely theoretical question about perfect solids under perfect conditions assume you have crystalline solid with perfect crystal lattice no defects lets imagine cube of pure diamond perhaps cm in volume now imagine that this solid was perfectly cleaved along perfect single plane with no damage to the crystal lattice on the exposed surfaces the cube is split into two halves exposing two perfectly planar surfaces with no damage or loss of material furthermore for the sake of discussion assume that the plane of cleaving is also perfectly aligned with one of the natural axes of the crystal lattice given these two halves of the crystalline solid would it be possible to reassemble them into the original solid by perfectly aligning the two halves and pressing them together given that the cleaving of the original solid involves breaking the inter atomic or inter molecular bonds holding the solid together it seems reasonable to suggest that the solid can be reassembled by placing the two halves in their original positions and by exerting sufficient pressure or energy cause these bonds to re form in essence we are talking about re assembling solid crystal without any glue and ending with with single solid indistinguishable and just as strong as the original what physical properties would prevent this from working under ideal conditions or is it theoretically possible if possible how would the required force compare to the force of cleaving where does the energy expended during cleaving go and how is energy re absorbed during re assembly
285186 suppose that cube of silicone elastomer 1cm of hardness similar to soft gum rubber durometer equivalent of was compressed by grams weight to height of 5cm and that the weight disappeared or was lifted faster than the speed of sound are there some physical theories that allow me to estimate how fast the elastomer would bounce back above height of 9mm imagining that the silicone was in fact soft eraser from school venture to suggest that the rebound would occur in less than thousandth of second but am clueless about how to research such narrow questions in science please can you enlighten me

285478 was reading few useful things to know about machine learning by pedro domingos and towards the end of the paper he makes this statement many researchers believe that causality is only convenient fiction for example there is no notion of causality in physical laws whether or not causality really exists is deep philosophical question with no definitive answer in sight was surprised by this statement because apart from heisenbergs uncertainty principle everything else that know of in physics seems to operate under the assumption of causal relations if you have an equation that describes definitive outcome as the result of some input factors then it is describing causal relationship is it not
285922 this question arose from my sci fi discussions with my friend it concerns artificial gravity through centrifugal force partly inspired by the artificial gravity created on the hermes ship from the martian imagine theres hollow torus donut in space without any external forces acting upon it which is rotating around the axis through the middle will an object which you place inside the pipe of the torus experience the centrifugal force due to rotation and be attracted to the edge of the torus or would it only experience the force if it was originally touching one of the walls and would the results be different if the torus was filled with gas air and if the inside of the torus was divided into sections like the ship
285933 dont think it would be possible at the very least if it is possible it would be difficult to produce them right this is because the wave speed will depend on the wavelength frequency so that finding the conditions for constructive interference would be harder
286360 newtons law of universal gravitation tells us that the potential energy of object in gravitational field is frac gmm tag the experimentally verified near earth gravitational potential is mgh tag the near earth potential should be an approximation for the general potential energy when approx text earth but the problem im having is that they scale differently with distance scales as frac 1r so the greater the distance from the earth the less potential energy an object should have but scales proportionally to distance so the greater the distance from the earth the more potential energy an object should have how is this reconcilable
286457 charged particle fixed to frame prime is accelerating an inertial frame for an observer in the frame the charged particle is accelerating being attached to frame prime and therefore he observes it to radiate however for the non inertial observer standing on the non inertial frame prime the charged particle is at rest and therefore does not radiate at all infers that the charged particle radiates but infers it doesnt can both inferences mutually contradictory be correct simultaneously if yes how
286576 am wondering about this when salty water in the ocean evaporates we are getting the clean distilled water why is that was trying to think on this and maybe the comparative size mass of water molecules to the size of different salts molecules plays role here but it is not likely the size mass of alcohol molecules is much higher but they still evaporate quite well could you explain intuitively
286721 what actually are virtual particles in various places around physics se documentaries and occasional news headlines see the term virtual particles normally virtual photons have tried researching it but im not at level of understanding yet to be able to grasp whats going on if someone could explain it in simple manner that would be great
286767 how can cosmological constant be candidate for dark energy if the universe is flat doesnt cosmological constant in efe give rise to positive negative or no curvature to the universe mean the efe with negative positive cosmological constant provide anti de sitter and de sitter space which are negatively positively curved respectively since the observed universe is very close to being flat how can cosmological constant be candidate for dark energy would we not then observe some significant curvature to the universe
286964 today at teachers seminar one of the teachers asked for fun whether zero should be followed by units metres second or metre or moles this question became hot topic and some teachers were saying that yes it should be while others were saying that it shouldnt be under certain conditions when came home tried to find the answer on the internet but got nothing should zero be followed by units edit for reopening my question is not just about whether there is dimensional analysis justification for dropping the unit after zero as positive answer to is 0m dimensionless would imply but whether and in which cases it is good idea to do so that you can in principle replace mathrm with doesnt mean that you should do so in all circumstances
287126 have heard various definitions of the uncertainty principle yet cannot quite comprehend how it is true nevertheless something tells me it is consequence of the wave nature of light electron which gives the intrinsic nature of uncertainty even if we dont measure it is it true that this principle is consequence of wave nature of particle that the uncertainty pops up due the fact that particle acts as wavei find no answer which stated the exact implication of the wave characteristics which should give the uncertainty principle will it be true to assume that if an electron acts only like particle and not as wave the uncertainty principle will not be necessarythis part of the question is not asked anywhere can you please tell me without much mathematics why this is so like we understood the photoelectric effect contradicts the wave nature of light could you please guide me the intuitive explanation with formal reason why we cannot absolutely know simultaneously the position and momentum of particle

287581 the google search page for mass of moon shows value with nine significant digits of precision the corresponding page for mass of earth shows value with only four significant digits the wikipedia page shows digits why the vast difference in precision does this have something to do with the earth mass being standard unit of mass in astronomy as mentioned on the wikipedia page for the record im not questioning the accuracy of either value but one would assume that digits of precision implies great deal of certainty and confidence regarding the accuracy

287877 im teaching home schooled year old some physics and chemistry and last nights experiment was an attempt to measure the density of air using an electronic balance that has proved pretty reliable and weighs things up to several tens of grams to precision of we weighed an empty balloon in little cardboard platform total about 7g then we inflated it by blowing into it and weighed it again the weight difference was 3g we then captured the air as follows using large bowl of water 1l plastic kitchen measuring jug calibrated in 50ml increments the jug was filled with water by dipping under the surface in the bowl and held inverted with the rim about 1cm below the surface of the water the air was released from the balloon under water capturing it in the inverted jug stopping the flow and refilling the jug with water when 800ml had been collected each time total volume of air collected ml ml this gives density of 75g per cubic meter whereas the accepted density of dry air is more like kg per cubic meter so my result is factor of too small my method was fairly crude but there is clearly colossal error here certainly exhaled air is wet and warmer than ambient with more carbon dioxide and less oxygen and hence of different density but not by factor of collecting the air under water could also have introduced errors however with each jugful of water was careful to ensure that once id collected each lot of 800ml of air the water level inside the jug was the same as the water level in the bowl so that the air inside the jug would be pretty close to ambient atmospheric pressure again errors here would be few percent not huge factor think the pressure in the balloon is irrelevant the contained air weighs whatever it weighs its the collected volume thats important not the volume in the balloon so what am doing wrong edit to describe updated method having recovered from my embarrassment at failing to do this properly the first time some may be interested in repeat of the experiment which has yielded much better result cut the valve out of bicycle inner tube and glued it into the lid of litre pop bottle having first drilled suitable hole in the lid through which to poke the valve this enabled me to pump the bottle up to about psi with bicycle pump this time unlike the balloon the bottle stretches only very slightly under pressure so the extra weight really is the extra weight of the air we collected the weighed extra air over water as before to measure its volume air had volume of the density came out as m3 which isnt too far from the accepted value of
287887 let mu nu be the generators of lorentz transformations so that ij generates rotations and 0i generates boosts the algebra of the poincar group contains muj alpha beta eta mu alpha beta eta mu beta alpha the mu component of this relation is the commutator of alpha beta with the hamiltonian for example in the case of rotations it implies hj ij so that angular momentum is conserved on the other hand in the case of boosts it implies hj 0i ip so apparently the boost operators dont commute with the hamiltonian the only way to make 0i to be conserved is to assume that it is explicitly time dependent so that dot 0i hj 0i partial 0i if we take partial 0i then we find that dot 0i and this operator is conserved question is there any first principles reason as to why we should take partial 0i or are the boost operators not conserved in general know that in the framework of canonical quantisation we take the mu nu operators to be mu nu int mathrm boldsymbol mu mathcal nu nu mathcal mu text spin part so that we indeed have partial 0i but this clearly relies on the existence of lagrangian and on the assumption that the generators of the poincar group must be those given by noethers formula and on all the details of canonical quantisation in general which imho is justified only because of consistency but there is no first principles reason to many of its ingredients am interested in the properties of the poincar group without any reference to lagrangian or to quantisation of classical system
287949 if your lagrangian satisfies frac partial mathcal partial then youre happy energy is conserved etc however if the above doesnt hold that doesnt necessarily mean energy isnt conserved maybe your lagrangian has false explicit time dependency for example mathcal frac dot kt dot the above lagrangian has partial mathcal partial dot but call that dependency fake or as the experts like to say spurious because it has the same equations of motion as this other lagrangian mathcal frac dot kx which has no explicit time dependency whatsoever so energy is conserved specifically this happened because you can shift derivatives around in your lagrangian using integration by parts at the level of the action similarly the following lagrangian mathcal frac dot gt also has fake explicit time dependency since you can remove gt which is just total time derivative equivalent to boundary term in the action on the other hand the lagrangian with variable mass mathcal frac mt dot is bonafide explicit time dependent theres no trick here to avoid it partial mathcal partial ne no matter what legal modifications you perform finally the following lagrangian has mixture of real and false explicit time dependencies mathcal frac mt dot kx gt its true explicit time dependency would be defined as partial mathcal partial after all integration by parts that could be performed have been done so and all total derivatives have been removed therefore the question is given generic lagrangian can its true explicit time dependency be determined in general

288035 am trying to connect the concepts learned from special relativity to those of general relativity take look at this example from wikipedia they find transformation matrix from the contravariant components of vector to the covariant components now lets move to general relativity know that in flat space the metric tensor is just the minkowski metric eta mu nu and know that in order to change vector to covector you simply contract the metric with the vector but if were to take vector mu and lower the index to covector mu in flat space it most certainly would not be the complicated change of basis matrix shown in the example am missing something here when you lower an index are you finding an entirely different entity or are you finding the covariant components of the same vector hope this makes sense
288287 as the wavelength of photon shrinks its energy rises and so its mass rises using hc lambda and on calculating the schwarzschild radius for photon based on its mass derived from those two equations found that the schwarzschild radius of the photon will be equal to lambda pi in one instance when the wavelength of the photon equals pi times the plancks length lambda pi times mathscr implies frac lambda pi where is the schwarzschild radius and mathscr is the plancks length in other words photon with wavelength lambda pi times mathscr would gravitationally trap itself in circular orbit with radius equal to the plank length photon in circular path with diameter of pi mathscr would have gravity well that would trap itself at the corresponding radius of the plank length with an orbital path diameter of lambda pi times mathscr has this been discussed as conceptual mechanism as to why the plank length is lower limit on potential allowed wavelengths and the resolution of the universe that photon with wavelength of pi mathscr in circular path with diameter equal to that wavelength would in fact be the definition of black hole
288339 in statistical mechanics it is stated that microstates are time reversible when you look at the different particles at the microlevel it seems like frictionless billiard table you cannot discern whether film is running forward or backward this only seems true without taking gravity into account if you have big enough cluster of particles you will also be able to discern the direction of the film on the microlevel one particle moving towards the big cluster and staying there film running forward my question is time reversibility at the microlevel broken when gravity is added to the picture
288351 it is sometimes said that if you stand still in space you travel through time at the speed of light on the other side light never stands still so it always only travels through space at the speed of light but not through time does that mean if our universe would be filled with light only no time would exist is the existence of mass therefor necessary for the existence of time
288357 why nucleons with parallel spins have greater nuclear force than the ones with anti parallel spins just want clear and easy explanation thank you
288472 am having some difficulty accepting the implications of the equation governing the intensity of light passing through polarization filters space cos theta with theta being the angular difference between the two filters heres the difficulty if put two filters at an angle of frac pi then no light makes it through to the other side but if then put another filter in between the original two then we apply the above equation twice successively neither time getting result of zero that is if you have two filters that dont allow any light through you can force them to allow light through by placing filter in between it seems to me that in general filter blocks light so the result is counterintuitive what happens to the light when the second filter is placed to allow some light to pass through the three filter system
288604 so our teacher recently showed us this diagram of the forces acting on ship however if you tilted the ship little so that the centre of gravity were slightly offset surely there would be an runaway effect where the entire ship would tilt further until it capsized bit like standing pencil on its tip and it falling over guess obviously this doesnt happen in real life ships return to the vertical if tilted but how could this be the case if their centre of buoyancy is above their centre of gravity
288614 know the many worlds interpretation is controversial among physicists but its been pop culture hit nonetheless frequently see people making statements like well in another universe im rock star where you can substitute rock star for any given fantasy but one thing thats always bothered me about that kind of statement does many worlds really imply every world you can have an infinite set of numbers that doesnt include every number so even assuming mwi is true is it necessarily true that one of those universes contain rockstar version of myself
288762 what does the pauli exclusion principle mean if time and space are continuous assuming time and space are continuous identical quantum states seem impossible even without the principle guess saying something like the closer the states are the less likely they are to exist would make sense but the principle is not usually worded that way its usually something along the lines of two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state

289041 the mponeng gold mine is nearly km deep it has the largest elevators in the world and is considered one of the most dangerous mines in the world the geothermal gradient is degrees celsius per kilometer which would be degrees therefore it would be well over boiling temperature at the deepest part of the mine at least theoretically why dont the miners get boiled to death also have read that the temperature in the mine is only which would seem to conflict with the geothermal gradient why is that
289083 this question showed up in my particle physics exam and im not sure of the answer said no since cant see any reason why they must be equal but my answer is right find it odd that its just coincidence that theyre both
289101 was standing outside in very light drizzle sun behind me saw rainbow know why they occur but was wearing polarized sunglasses as an experiment turned my sunglasses through degrees the rainbow got brighter partially expected this since rainbows are very directional what did not expect is that my naked eye without sunglasses saw dimmer rainbow than the eye looking through the polarized dark glass had expected it to be about the same more than that through the sunglasses the colours were more vibrant what are the reasons for this didnt think refracted light could be that polarized
289108 im having difficulty understanding the bra ket notation used in quantum mechanics for instance take the notation used in the question is there relation between quantum theory and fourier analysis let be an operator on wavefunction fg be wavefunctions and be dummy variable representing basis for suppose if im understanding the notation correctly then rangle function independent of basis psi rangle the state vector langle rangle rangle transformed to position basis langle rangle operator on an eigenvalue of that produces the corresponding eigenfunction under position basis rangle operator on an eigenvalue of that produces the corresponding eigenfunction independent of basis langle gx rangle langle psi gx psi rangle expectation of gx on measure langle psi rangle langle rangle is the projection of onto langle fg rangle for normalized langle rangle is undefined langle rangle is undefined rangle is undefined the bra portion of the bra ket is always dummy variable for position for momentum etc the ket portion is always function operator for the momentum operator etc does this look right also how does the three argument version langle rangle work same question for the bra version langle if the bra is the basis then what does it mean to take basis without function
289628 the arrow of time is often associated with the fact that entropy always increases on the other side that should mean if entropy decreases time should run backwards but inside refrigerator we have that situation entropy inside refrigerator decreases at least while cooling down however when looking into the refrigerator while cooling down time doesnt seem to run backwards things fall down and not upwards broken things dont reassemble themselves etc do understand that refrigerator is not closed system and the second law of thermodynamics doesnt apply but should that also mean that no arrow of time can be defined for an open system like refrigerator or must we conclude that the connection between entropy and time is an illusion if we cannot use entropy to define an arrow of time inside an open system what is it that makes sure that time doesnt run backwards inside an refrigerator update found recent article siegel where does our arrow of time come from where the author states basically the same idea in different words if all you did was live in pocket of the universe that saw its entropy decrease time would still run forward for you the thermodynamic arrow of time does not determine the direction in which we perceive time passage so where does the arrow of time that correlates with our perception come from
289924 if we say that an instant of time has no duration why does sum of instants add up to something that has duration have hard time understanding this think of one instant as being moment of time hence the sum of many instants would make finite time period for example minutes edit since got so many great answers was wondering if someone can also give illustrative example besides the pure math am just being curious
290049 it sounds absurd but it seems to come naturally know that mu nu mu cdot nu source and that the diagonal elements of eta mu nu are typically pm1 this seems to very clearly suggest that the basis vectors corresponding to negative metric components could be or similar if these are not the basis vectors in sr would like to ask what are the basis vectors then of course theyre variable but what would cartesian basis look like if mu nu mu cdot nu does not hold for those vectors why not
290074 am learning ss introduction of quantum field theory my teacher said that if the mass of neutrino is exactly then we should not observe any right handed neutrinos and left handed anti neutrinos according to weyls theory it is because left gamma mu partial mu right psi left begin array cc left partial vec sigma cdot vec nabla right left partial vec sigma cdot vec nabla right end array right left begin array psi psi end array right if we set then we will have begin align left partial vec sigma cdot vec nabla right psi left partial vec sigma cdot vec nabla right psi end align and if these formulas can describe neutrinos we must conclude that there are two types of neutrinos my confusions are it is known that the mass of neutrino is not therefore there are chances depending on the mass to find right handed neutrinos and left handed anti neutrinos but we dont if accept that there are only these two types of neutrinos right handed anti neutrinos and left handed neutrinos this property of neutrino causes the parity violation so parity violation must relate to angular momentum and therefore spinor space am write are there any reasons why neutrino is so weird that is has mass but still has helicity or this goes against with what have learned that only when particle moves at the speed of light can its spin aligned with its momentum
290132 am self learning gr this is rather long post but needed to clarify few things about the effect of general coordinate transformations on the global symmetries of metric any comments insights are much appreciated to be concrete lets consider that mu nu represents an axially symmetric spacetime kerr black hole in boyer lindquist coordinates theta phi metric has no dependence on and phi they are cyclic coordinates mu nu dx mu dx nu frac 2mr cos theta dt frac cos theta 2mr dr cos theta theta left frac 2ma sin theta cos theta right sin theta phi frac 2ma sin theta cos theta dt phi consequently particles energy and angular momentum are conserved suppose make coordinate transformation bar mu lambda mu nu dx nu where if am not mistaken lambda is matrix which is an element of the general linear group gl with non zero determinant in the new coordinates metric may not have cyclic coordinates good example would be representation of the above metric in kerr schild coordinates begin align mu nu dx mu dx nu bar dx dy dz frac 2mr 2z left bar frac rx dx dy ax dy dx frac dz right text where qquad end align now there is only one cyclic coordinate bar presume we may in principle introduce new coordinates where none of the coordinates appear to be cyclic in functional form of mu nu dx mu dx nu suppose make such coordinate transformation my questions are does the new metric still have global symmetries conserved quantities that correspond to and if the answer to the first question is yes then suppose gave this new metric to someone without telling about the coordinate transformation and ask if there are any symmetries will she he able to find symmetries by finding closed orbits in the geodesic flow to me the answer to both questions above seemed to be yes think that the integrability in the liouville sense of the metric should not depend on ones definition of the coordinates in other words because of the global symmetries we expect bounded geodesics around the black hole in the old coordinates we may easily calculate such closed trajectories and according to my thinking closed geodesics exist objects revolve around the black hole regardless of how we label the coordinates but could not be sure of this to explain my confusion let me write frac mu ds gamma mu nu lambda frac nu ds frac lambda ds which gives the geodesic flow the existence of the bounded trajectories here depends on the number of zeros and poles of the christoffel symbol and also on their relative locations the thing is one can mess with these parameters by making an arbitrary but an invertible coordinate transformation to the metric and therby change the flow also perhaps somewhat related to this it was pointed out here that coordinate transformation when viewed as diffeomorphism does not always map geodesics to geodesics unless it is an isometry so what is the correct way to think about this do all coordinate transformations diffeomorphisms conserve global symmetries or subgroup of them
290340 my physics book mentions that its kinetic energy being released from the splitting of atoms but it makes more sense for it to be heat energy as the construction of power plant as shown below is using the energy to heat water to produce steam is it really kinetic energy released from fission or heat energy as if it was kinetic then couldnt we directly transfer the kinetic energy to the turbine without the need of steam
290472 im working on some exercise regarding the spin coupling of two electrons there we have the wavefunctions corresponding to the values as begin align begin array uparrow uparrow dfrac sqrt uparrow downarrow downarrow uparrow downarrow downarrow end array 5mm frac sqrt uparrow downarrow downarrow uparrow end align understand that the three wavefunctions for are symmetric and the one for is antisymmetric my question is why is the combination with the minus sign is the one for my thinking is that in uparrow downarrow or downarrow uparrow combination the components would already add up to so that the minus sign would not change anything in the fact that or is it that downarrow uparrow or uparrow downarrow each represent state with and so that subtracting the one from the other gives
290614 as far as know the electroweak theory only holds for some energy scale probably the one we use at the lhc for that scale there is gauge theory for the electroweak interaction under this scale symmetry breaking occurs and this unification does no longer hold then we get again electromagnetism qed what theory then describes the weak interaction thought we need this unification because there is no gauge theory for the weak interaction that is conistent with qed
290688 noticed something interesting yesterday if consider the unit vectors in spherical coordinates expressed in terms of the cartesian unit vectors hat textbf sin theta cos phi hat textbf sin theta sin phi hat textbf cos theta hat textbf hat boldsymbol theta cos theta cos phi hat textbf cos theta sin phi hat textbf sin theta hat textbf hat boldsymbol phi sin phi hat textbf cos phi hat textbf see that one can get the expression for hat boldsymbol theta by taking the derivative of hat textbf with respect to theta similarly one can get the expression for hat boldsymbol phi by taking the derivative of hat textbf with respect to phi and then setting theta to pi im not completely sure what the second part of this means know that hat boldsymbol phi cannot depend on theta but why that particular value guess hat boldsymbol phi lives in the plane or something except for this parenthetical remark this makes sense to me as the unit vectors in curvilinear coordinates are functions of the coordinates and their derivatives with respect to the coordinates should be easily related to the other unit vectors in an orthogonal coordinates system this is particularly useful because dont have the expressions for hat boldsymbol phi and hat boldsymbol theta in terms of the cartesian unit vectors memorized but can easily derive them from the expression for hat textbf however also noticed similar relationship for the cartesian unit vectors hat textbf sin theta cos phi hat textbf cos theta cos phi hat boldsymbol theta sin phi hat boldsymbol phi hat textbf sin theta sin phi hat textbf cos theta sin phi hat boldsymbol theta cos phi hat boldsymbol phi hat textbf cos theta hat textbf sin theta hat boldsymbol theta if one takes the textit partial derivative of hat textbf with respect to phi ignoring the phi dependence of the spherical unit vectors one gets the expression for hat textbf similarly taking the partial derivative of hat textbf with respect to theta and setting phi to yields the expression for hat textbf however since cartesian coordinates are not curviliear taking their derivatives with respect to the coordinates doesnt really make sense whats going on here is this just coincidence or something meaningful
290690 ive been studying the postulates of qm and seeing how to derive important ideas from them one thing that havent been able to derive from them however is the identity of the momentum operator for simplicity im only thinking about no relativistic effects no spin no time dependent potentials and one spatial dimension also im assuming the position operator is simply multiplication by as in im in position space so the hamiltonian operator is frac hbar 2m nabla know that the momentum operator is hbar frac partial partial but how do get there from the postulates know that it makes sense as it results in the ehrenfest theorem the de broglie wavelength hypothesis the heisenberg uncertainty principle for and the momentum operator being the generator of the translation operator and possibly many other desirable theorems and correlations with classical momentum but none of these are postulates at least not in the various formalisms encountered so you cant derive hbar frac partial partial from them rather they are consequences of it you need to know the operator beforehand to see that they are correct yes this is just semantics but that is the core issue for me regardless of how much sense it makes is the identity hbar frac partial partial under the assumptions made postulate meaning that you cant derive it from other postulates or can it in fact be obtained from them and in the latter case could you show me how note know that there are many different and equivalent sets of postulates for qm but in none that saw did they name it as postulate nor properly derived it

290906 it is often said that according to general relativity spacetime is curved by the presence of matter energy but isnt it simply the coordinate lines of the coordinate system that are curved
291186 in the ideal gas the volume of molecule and the interactions between the molecules are assumed to be negligible why arent the interactions between the molecules and the walls of the container assumed to be negligible why are they much larger than those between molecules
291481 when we first studying vibrations in crystals we begin by studying the monoatomic chain and then go onto the diatomic chain with series of alternating masses in studying these we look to calculate the dispersion relation which is the angular frequency as function of the wave vector for example in the monoatomic chain we can derive the dispersion relation as omega sqrt frac 4c sin big frac ka big where is spring constant inherent in the crystal structure is the mass of the atoms on the chain is the wave vector and is the atomic spacing in the chain when studying the diatomic chain we get two solutions corresponding to the optical diatomic only and acoustic diatomic and monoatomic waves what dont understand is exactly why we are concerned with an angular frequency what has the property of angular frequency as far as know there is no rotational motion and the intrinsic frequency of wave is surely more useful in addition to this question how can we calculate the frequency of say an optical wave of diatomic chain given the angular frequency from the dispersion relation omega
291491 walter lewins first lecture at analyzes the time for an apple to fall to the ground using dimensional analysis his reasoning goes like this its natural to suppose that height of the apple to the ground mass of the apple and the acceleration due to gravity may impact pardon the pun the time it takes for the apple to reach the ground then propto alpha beta gamma on both sides the units must be equivalent so alpha beta left frac right gamma alpha gamma beta gamma therefore gamma quad alpha gamma quad beta solving we have gamma frac quad alpha frac quad beta then we conclude sqrt frac where is some unit less constant lewin concludes that the apple falls independently of its mass as proved in his thought experiment and verified in real life but dont agree with his reasoning lewin made the assumption that is unit less why could he come to this conclusion after all some constants have units like the gravitational constant why isnt the following reasoning correct the constant has the unit therefore to match both sides of the equation beta so indeed the mass of the apple does impact its fall time
291621 let us consider cylinder filled with ideal gas and let us assume that the gravitational field is parallel to one of its sides well in this case how would the system be in equilibrium suppose that in fact the system is in equilibrium with temperature pressure and volume knowing that the pressure is related to the density of the gas and its average kinect energy we would expect pressure greather in the bottom than in the top how could the system be in equilibrium then
291991 intro in completing walter lewins 6th lecture on newtons laws he presents an experiment go to which leaves me baffled experiment recommend watching the video see link above there is kg block with identical strings attached to it one at the top the other at the bottom the top string is attached to ceiling and the bottom to floor professor lewin stretches the system by pulling on the bottom string with the block not accelerating one string snaps prediction initially the top string has tension of approximately to counter the force of gravity the bottom string has no tension at all then when lewin pulls the bottom string it gains some tension to counter act the force exerted by the bottom string the top string exerts now assume that the string with more force will give out sooner leading me to conclude that the top string will break results this was conducted by lewin not me see link above trial bottom string breaks trial top string breaks trial bottom string breaks additional notes the results dont seem consistent if was right id expect all experiments to be right conversely if was wrong id expect all experiments wrong with one exception the results are more less random and one result isnt preferred over the other question why was my prediction incorrect was there flaw in my logic why were the results inconsistent
292411 the square of the momentum operator hat from the time independent schr dinger equation is hat hbar frac dx tag in the one dimensional case so if we solve this equation for hat we obtain hat hbar frac dx the overall minus sign is subjective but there is one major problem have with equation it assumes that frac dx left frac dx right tag now we know that in general frac dx ne left frac dx right so why does equation hold in this particular case
292565 im asking this question because im feeling bit confused about how lorentz transformations relate to the electromagnetic tensor and hope someone can help me clear out my possible misunderstandings please excuse me if the answer is obvious in special relativity the em field is described by the tensor mu nu begin pmatrix end pmatrix which is an anti symmetric matrix then recalling the one to one correspondence between skew symmetric matrices and orthogonal matrices established by cayley transformation one could view this tensor as an infinitesimal rotation matrix that is generator of dim pseudo rotations this seems at first natural given that space time velocities and momenta for fixed mass particle have fixed vector norms all forces including em and accelerations on the particle will be lorentz transformations however this page is the unique reference ive found which states such relationship and dont fully understand the discussion which follows which find somewhat disconcerting is this line of reasoning correct on the other hand according to wikipedia general lorentz transformation can be written as an exponential mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf mathbf cdot mathbf mathbf cdot mathbf where im quoting mathbf are the rotation generators which correspond to angular momentum mathbf are the boost generators which correspond to the motion of the system in spacetime and the axis angle vector mathbf and rapidity vector mathbf are altogether six continuous variables which make up the group parameters in this particular representation here the group is the lie group so then the generator for general lorentz transformation can be written as mathbf cdot mathbf mathbf cdot mathbf xk yk zk xj yj zj begin pmatrix zeta zeta zeta zeta theta theta zeta theta theta zeta theta theta end pmatrix how does this matrix relate with the em tensor by comparison between the two matrices it would appear that the components of the electric and magnetic field mathbf and mathbf should be linked respectively with mathbf and mathbf im missing what the physical interpretation of this would be
292913 in some textbooks the neutron star is explained as degenerate fermi gas to calculate the degenerate pressure of the neutron fermi gas the average energy of neutron is calculated when the volume is changed du dv however this does not consider that the changing neutron density under compression also changes the potential caused by strong interaction between the neutrons at least the attractive hartree potential in the hartree fock formalism grows linearly with nulceon density which grows by this gain in would win over the repulsive increase in the kinetic energy under compression which grows only by thus the negative pressure caused by the increasing binding energy grows faster than the positive fermi gas pressure due to the kinetic energy it is energetically advantageous to collapse what will certainly prevent collapse is the hard core of the neutron the strongly repulsive nuclear force for distances below fm as dicussed in question why is the central density of the nucleus constant the density of the nuclei is not too far away from tightly packed spheres with fm radius however this is totally different physics and the textbooks would wrongly explain the neutron star as fermi gas suspect that the constant density may have something to do with the fock term exchange potential in the hartree fock equation which in fact is another representation of pauli exlusion principle compensating the increase in the hartree term what is the nature of neutron star
292958 know the spent fuel is still radioactive but it has to be more stable than what was put in and thus safer than the uranium that we started with that is to say is storage of the waste such big deal if mine the uranium use it and then bury the waste back in the mine or any other hole should encounter any problems am not doing the inhabitants of that area favor as they will have less radiation to deal with than before
293042 for an object or force to do work it needs energy but from where does the gravitational force get the energy to do work upon say falling object the gravitational force is doing work upon the object isnt it searched the internet and physics se and found this caesar asked similar question and udiboy1209 answered it udiboy1209 says lets take the example of ball dropped from some height gravity of the earth pulls it downward doing work on the ball and giving it kinetic energy the question you ask is where did it get this energy from go back step and think about how this ball ended up at such height you lifted it up with your arms and put it on that height your arms did work against gravity spent some energy to put that ball on that height where did that spent energy go this was given to gravity when you do work against gravity you store energy in the gravitational field as gravitational potential energy which then gravity uses to do work on that object but isnt the work done by our arms stored on the ball he says that the energy spent is stored in the gravitational field work is done upon the ball shouldnt the energy be stored on the ball if so then where does gravitational force get its energy to do work upon the ball on the first place
293063 admitting the ansatz ikx tag then frac tag and frac tag if one admits that the total energy is related to momentum as frac 2m admiting also the de broglie relations it follows that frac 2m frac frac tag this is schr dingers equation this equation is said to be non relativistic because of its use of frac 2m rigorously speaking though it is non relativistic because it is not lorentz invariant however starting from the relativistic total energy equation frac sqrt frac mc mc tag where is the kinetic energy and mc the particle self energy now using the expansion of frac sqrt frac mc mc frac mv frac 3mv 8c frac 5mv 16c and ignoring members dividing by because we are considering ll it becomes frac mv mc mc frac 2m mc tag or frac 2m mc frac 2k 2m mc tag so mc do not vanishes even under classical approximation admitting that plancks and de broglies equations holds in every situation and that in planck equation is the total energy substituting equation and into the schr dinger equation would have the form frac 2m frac mc frac tag now we could postulate this equation making the steps of getting it less fundamental then the end result tried to consider that ll mc in schr dinger equation but realize that an electron in hydrogen atom moving with half the speed of light using classical equations as we are analyzing schr dinger equation it would have less than rm 100kev rm 64kev if my math is not wrong of kinetic energy but rm 511kev of self energy so my question is why schr dinger equation do not have an mc term if is supposed to be the total energy and not just the kinetic energy
293106 need to show that the surface of water in bucket rotating with constant angular velocity will have parabolic shape im quite confused by this problem but heres what did vec cf vec grav vec nabla vec omega times vec mg hat where cf is the centrifugal force grav is the force of gravity is potential energy vec xyz so nabla uz mg omega hence uz gmz frac omega which is parabola in this approach was trying to use the fact that the surface is equipotential for cf grav but apparently my approach doesnt quite hold any water please give some suggestion on approaching this problem as have no other idea
293359 in another post claimed that there was obviously an oscillating charge in hydrogen atom when you took the superposition of 1s and 2p state one of the respected members of this community john rennie challenged me on this saying why do you say there is an oscillating charge distribution for hydrogen atom in superposition of 1s and 2p states dont see what is doing the oscillating am the only one that sees an oscillating charge or is john rennie missing something here id like to know what people think
293451 as can see in the picture there are so many pillars which are holding the bridge this picture gave question to me that what are these pillars doing below the bridge an appripriate answer could be these are providing support to bridge tried to get the answer as follows in the first image there are two pillars holding bridge of mass since gravitaional force is acting downwards thus pillars are bearing force of frac mg in the second image there are four pillars bearing force of frac mg im assuming that mass of bridge is uniformly distributed and each pillar is bearing an equal amount of the load now the question is that since the pillars are bearing the force so if we make strong enough pillars to bear large force then there will be no need of so many pillars but that is not the case we see large number of pillars holding bridge what is wrong with the work did shouldnt the number of pillars depend upon the strength of the pillars we make rather than the length of the bridge shall be thankful if you can provide more information about this topic
293543 as far as know an electron cant go below what is known as the ground state which has an energy of ev but why cant it lose any more energy is there deeper explanation or is this supposed to be accepted the way it is
293831 we use source sigma ma spring damp for the forces acting on an object undergoing damped harmonic oscillation we define damp beta where beta is the drag constant and is the velocity my question is why damp is proportional to and not because if we have damped pendulum the damping force should relate to the air resistance drag force which is proportional to drag frac rho if we let beta frac rho we get drag beta so why is the damping force proportional to and not
293864 the paper gloge marcuse formal quantum theory of light rays starts with the sentence maxwells theory can be considered as the quantum theory of single photon and geometrical optics as the classical mechanics of this photon that caught me by surprise because always thought maxwells equations should arise from qed in the limit of infinite photons according to the correspondence principle of high quantum numbers as expressed by sakurai the classical limit of the quantum theory of radiation is achieved when the number of photons becomes so large that the occupation number may as well be regarded as continuous variable the space time development of the classical electromagnetic wave approximates the dynamical behavior of trillions of photons isnt the view of sakurai in contradiction to gloge do maxwells equation describe single photon or an infinite number of photons or do maxwells equations describe single photon and also an infinite number of photons at the same time but why do we need qed then at all
293873 always thought the non linearity of einsteins field equations implies that there should be direct graviton graviton interactions but stumbled upon wikipedia which argues if gravitons exist then like photons and unlike gluons gravitons do not interact with other particles of their kind that is gravitons carry the force of gravitation but are not affected by it this is apparent due to gravity being the only thing which escapes from black holes in addition to having an infinite range and traveling in straight lines similarly to electromagnetism is wikipedia correct if not why not and what then are the arguments that there must be graviton graviton interactions as of this question being asked the above paragraph has been removed from wikipedia
293947 im not very familiar about string theory but just curious wanted to know in what sense are the strings of string theory different from quanta of relativistic fields which we interpret as particles im looking for an answer that an self taught student of quantum field theory and someone unfamiliar with the mathematical formalism of string theory can understand in quantum field theory particles or field excitations are momentum eigenstates and therefore delocalized and hence they are not point objects popular talks of string theory also suggest that strings too are extended objects then what is the difference between strings and particles as learnt in quantum field theory not too technical answer will be helpful
294047 understand that if the frequency of driving force coincides with the natural frequency of an oscillator say pendulum the rate at which energy is transferred to the same is maximized however there may be other frequencies that are not so efficient but do transfer energy to the system the latter absorbs it the usual graphs plot intensity or amplitude versus frequency and they have the look of steep triangle so they point at the frequencies surrounding the natural one as the most effective but what about frequencies that are sub multiples of the natural frequency like and so on for example when swinging take impulse not every time reach peak but every other time it seems to me that force operating at this frequency should attain as much amplitude increase as the natural one in every shot though of course it shoots at lower rate thus understand that this actor does not shine up in graph plotting against intensity which is power surface so it has time dependence ok but dont see why these frequencies are not merited in graph plotting purely against amplitude like this one reason may be damping the effect is wiped out before it can consolidate but what if the oscillator were ideally free of damping anyhow leaving aside the graphs can it be said that those are after the natural frequency itself the most effective frequencies in terms of increasing amplitude
294271 why do we use the electron volt why did it come to be the electron volt and not say just prefix of the joule like the nanojoule does the electron volt represent anything particular as far as the mathematics goes am guessing that it does and if so what is it that the electron volt exactly represents in terms of the mass of particle as have seen it used for both the energy of photon and the mass of subatomic particles
294833 was watching the video the ingenious design of the aluminum beverage can at the author says spherical can has no corner so no weak points because the pressure in the can uniformly stresses the wall and later talking about cuboid these edges are weak points and require very thick walls it is intuitive to me that in sphere the wall is stressed uniformly it is also quite intuitive that edges of cuboid cans are weak points as they can be hit from the exterior from wider angle however the statement says that in sphere there is no weak points because the pressure in the can uniformly stresses the wall suggests to me that in cuboid the pressure is not uniform and eventually higher in the corners this is not intuitive to me is the pressure higher against the corners than against flat walls in cuboid how much does the pressure against the walls vary if it does in cuboid at equilibrium when not at equilibrium typically when the cuboid is accelerated it the pressure higher against the corners
294965 in most references ive seen see for example peskin and schroeder problem or section here one constructs the field operator hat phi for the complex klein gordon field as follows first you take the lagrangian density for the classical klein gordon field mathcal partial mu phi dagger partial mu phi phi dagger phi tag and find the momentum conjugate to the field phi via pi frac partial mathcal partial dot phi dot phi dagger tag then one imposes the usual canonical commutation relations on hat phi and hat pi hat phix hat piy delta 3x tag so one needs to find operators hat phi and hat pi such that they obey the above commutation relations and such that hat pi dot phi dagger the textbooks then go on to show that defining hat phi int frac vec pi frac sqrt 2p dagger mu mu pe mu mu tag hat pi int frac vec pi sqrt frac mu mu dagger mu mu tag where and are bosonic annihilation operators satisfies these properties my question is why do we need two different particle operators to define hat phi and hat pi it seems to me that one could simply define hat phi int frac vec pi frac sqrt 2p mu mu tag hat pi int frac vec pi sqrt frac dagger mu mu tag with hat single bosonic annihilation operator then clearly hat pi dot hat phi dagger and also begin array rcl hat phix hat piy int frac 3p pi frac 3q pi sqrt frac 4p iq mu mu mu mu pa dagger int frac 3p pi frac 3q pi sqrt frac 4p iq mu mu mu mu pi delta 3p int frac 3p pi frac ip mu mu mu frac delta 3y end array tag which is up to some details about normalizing the hat correct we would then have klein gordon field with just one kind of excitation the hat excitation why do all textbooks claim we need two separate bosonic excitations hat and hat
294966 have seen simulations of antimatter on tv has antimatter ever been photographed
294984 the diffusion equation of the form frac partial uxt partial frac partial 2uxt partial if one chooses real value for the solutions are usually decaying with time however in some situations in physics most notably the time dependent schr dinger equation one sees an equation of similar form to the diffusion equation but with complex diffusion coefficient this causes the equations solutions to osculate instead of decay with time because exp dt exp idt which is why the schr dinger equation has wave solutions like the wave equations it seems like one can transform the diffusion equation to an equation that can replace the wave equation since the solutions are the same this does not make much intuitive sense to me so think my understanding of the solutions of the wave and diffusion equation is not complete what is the difference if any in the set of solutions of the diffusion equation with an imaginary diffusion coefficient and the wave equations
295232 am learning about inductors and capacitors and we derived the energy stored on capacitor to be of that delivered by the battery we did this considering circuit of capacitor connected to battery and resistor in series to not encounter the problem of an infinite initial current if we assumed there was no other resistor in the circuit however our lecturer assured us that no matter how small the resistance in the circuit even if it is just the small resistance of the wires exactly of energy would be lost this made sense to me from the mathematics assume that in the case of capacitor it is impossible to consider the theoretical case with no initial circuit resistance as you get infinities popping up in the mathematics then we considered an inductor charging in simple circuit consisting of just battery and an inductor and found that all of the energy from the battery is stored on the inductor appreciate that this is just theoretical treatment and that some energy would be lost in the wires internal resistance of the battery and also understand why similar theoretical treatment of the capacitor case is impossible however cant think of the fundamental reason as to why it is completely impossible to charge capacitor with anything but of the battery energy whereas an inductor could theoretically store

295365 quantum mechanics says that if system is in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian then the state ket representing the system will not evolve with time so if the electron is in say the first excited state then why does it change its state and relax to the ground state since it was in hamiltonian eigenstate it should not change with time
295412 in text introduction to quantum mechanics by griffiths am using it states without motivation that spin angular momentum has the same commutations relations as orbital angular momentum these relations with the ladder operators were used to find the eigenvalue equations of orbital angular momentum these are the spin angular momentum commutation relations hat hat hbar hat hat hat hbar hat hat hat hbar hat it follows then that spin angular momentum has the same eigenvalue equations as orbital angular momentum hat rangle hbar rangle hat rangle hbar rangle further in the text we consider two particle system of two spin frac particles for example the electron and proton of hydrogen atom in ground state where we define the spin operator as hat hat hat it then states that in order to confirm eigenvectors belonging to this operator we have to ensure that the eigenvalue equations above are satisfied just want to know if the commutation relations holds for any spin operator even for multi particle systems and is that then why the same eigenvalue equations arise if this is true then we should also be able to apply the ladder operator in each case in about the same way as orbital angular momentum to derive the eigenvectors of certain spin operator
295478 so diamond has energy band gap of approx ev if that is too much for visible light approx ev to be absorbed and then it travels straight through diamond although still see diamond know that when light goes through there is change in index of refraction if visible light does not interact with the diamond then how does it reflect off the surface

296103 consider magnet with temperature we can observe its net magnetization so we say that value of specifies macrostate statistical mechanics tells us which macrostate the magnet is in to do this we compute the free energy fm and minimize it the free energy is defined by ts and hence depends on the entropy this entropy is determined by the number of microstates that could be compatible with the given macrostate the number of spin states that lead to the magnetization we observe this procedure has always felt sketchy to me because it seems to rely on some subjective notion of knowledge the reason that there are many allowed microstates is because weve postulated that we know nothing about the system besides the net magnetization if we did know something else it would decrease the number of consistent microstates and change the entropy which changes as such it looks like the result of the calculation depends on the set of macrostates we use for example suppose somehow attached measuring device to every single spin then in principle could specify my macrostates with long list containing the state of every spin then there is only one microstate corresponding to each macrostate in this case for each macrostate and the minimum free energy is attained for minimum then conclude that the system is always in the ground state whats wrong with this reasoning is it somehow illegal to make this macrostate choice could acquiring all of this information about the spins necessarily change how the magnet behaves from something like landauers principle in general can changing macrostate choice ever change the predictions of statistical mechanics

296521 if the buoyant force acting on body submerged in liquidsay water does not depend on depth why does it become increasingly difficult to push an object deeper and deeper know that the buoyant force is just the pressure difference between the bottom and the top of an object and since the only forces acting are the force which you are applying on the body to push it the buoyant force and the weight of the object and also since the latter are constant shouldnt also be constant could someone please point out to me where am going wrong
296601 know amplitudes cancel destructive or combine constructive as per image below source but how do frequencies cancel out or combine for some context question from my textbook song is played off cd one set of speakers is playing the note at hz but the presence of the second set of speakres causes beats of frequency hz to be heard at point equidistanct from the four speakers the possible frequencies being playing by the addition speakers are answer and hz am not sure if understand the concept correctly but amplitudes canceling out makes sense as its matter of negative amplitude cancelling out an equal magnitude positive amplitude and combining into one wave or variations of this depending on the magnitude of each wave so to me this seems like matter of distance displacements in the form of amplitude or distance above or below the centerline canceling out but dont see how this works for frequencies frequency is waves second so wouldnt playing hz frequency and hz frequency just cause both of them to be heard separately rather than cancel out to hz dont understand how speeds can cancel out

296678 have variously heard people describe the no cloning theorem as an essential feature of quantum physics akin to saying we cannot copy arbitrary quantum information to arbitrary precision however this question is about the interpretation of the quantum result only insofar as this sheds light on the classical result presented in the course of the question the basic formal statement of the theorem is that given hilbert space there is no unitary operator otimes to otimes such that lvert rangle otimes lvert rangle lvert rangle otimes lvert rangle for all lvert rangle in and blank state lvert rangle the question is is anything about this result surprising or quantum from the viewpoint of classical mechanics heres an argument that no cloning also holds in classical mechanics taken almost verbatim from theres no cloning in symplectic mechanics by fenyes let omega be symplectic manifold the omega is the symplectic form that encodes what we physicists call the poisson bracket by omegax fx fg where is the vector field defined by mathrm omegax then all physical motions on are symplectomorphisms functions to that preserve omega because they are integral flows of the hamiltonian vector field which is symplectic vector field by construction the combined phase space of two systems omegam omega is times omega omega where times is the cartesian product of manifolds now the classical analogue to the no cloning theorem would clearly be the statement that there is no symplectomorphism phi times to times such that phiab phiaa for all in and blank state in and indeed this is true let uv in bb times be tangent vectors at bb since phixb xx by assumption curves gammatb starting at bb get mapped to curves gammat gammat starting at bb and so mathrm phi bb w0 ww for all in bb times therefore begin align omega omegau0v0 omega omegauuvv implies omegauv omega00 omegauv omegauv implies omegauv end align which is contradiction because symplectic forms are non degenerate by definition therefore no classical hamiltonian cloning map exists so what does this result actually show are the assumptions of the no cloning theorem silly and the desired cloning map does not actually reflect what we mean by being able to copy arbitrary information in either case is there subtle difference between the classical and the quantum setting which makes the assumptions silly in the classical but not in the quantum setting if the assumptions are not silly then what is the significance of the classical result

297279 in this blog post lubos motl claims that any commutator may be shown to reduce to the classical poisson brackets lim limits hbar to frac hbar left hat hat right where hat and hat are the hermitian operators corresponding to the classical observables and how is this done edit as acuriousmind points out the proof is trivial if you start with classical hamiltonian and then quantize it via reasonable quantization procedure but what have in mind is starting with quantum hamiltonian and the canonical commutation relation hat hat delta ij then taking some limit hbar to and showing that the resultant emergent classical theory has poisson brackets that agree with the quantum commutators under these assumptions you cant use any facts about your quantization procedure because you never quantize classical hamiltonian at all
297386 have seen several questions and good answers on the link between reversible and quasistatic processes such as here or here however these questions only adress one side of the problem reversible process is necessarily quasistatic am interested in the other side of the equivalence is there process that is quasistatic yet not reversible it looks to me that an irreversible process cannot be made perfectly quasistatic the wikipedia article about quasistatic processes takes as an example the very slow compression of gas with friction as the compression occurs very slowly the transformation is quasistatic and the friction makes it irreversible am not convinced by this example if you press on the piston with vanishingly small force you will have to reach the threshold of the coulomb law for solid friction before moving the piston anyway it makes the process non quasi static however small the coulomb threshold might be another example ive heard of is the reaction between strong acid and strong base it is always an irreversible process and you could make it quasistatic by adding very small drops of base into acid at time but by trying to do that you would inevitably reach limit to the size of the drop imposed by surface tension even if reversible and quasistatic mean very different things is it true to consider that in practice reversible process and quasistatic process is essentially the same thing

298790 have read this question what is the general relativity explanation for why objects at the center of the earth are weightless and john rennies answer where he says when the christoffel symbol gamma tt is zero and that means the radial four acceleration is zero and that means youre weightless and this question gravitational time dilation at the earths center and lubo motls answer where he says if you spend billion years at the center of the earth your twin brother outside the gravitational field will get billion and one years older if you wish you may interpret it by saying that its healthy to live at the center of the earth good luck so what the two are saying is that at the center of mass there is time dilation there is no curvature read and understand what they are writing about the christoffel symbol gamma tt frac 2r left 2m 2r mr left3 sqrt frac 2mr sqrt frac 2m right right and the potential at the center assuming uniformity is phi frac gm gr frac frac frac gm frac gr and that this gravitational potential determines the slowing of time too and somehow just cannot understand how it is possible to have time dilation without curvature thought that time dilation is caused by in gr not sr curvature which is the effect of gravity the gravitational potential dont understand how there can be gravitational potential without curvature thought the only effect gravity has is the curvature of spacetime can somebody please explain how with math and with simple way too how that is possible together how can there be gravitational potential and time dilation without curvature isnt gravitys only effect the curvature is there another effect with what gravity can create potential so without creating curvature and so create time dilation
299286 the following is quote from an answer was given to this previous question of mine the definition of the expectation value of an operator is begin equation langle rangle int psi ax psi dx end equation tag because it represents the value of the variable ax times the probability of being in that configuration px psi psi and for the particular case of the expectation value of the position operator begin equation langle rangle int psi psi dx end equation tag ever since asked that question have been using equation without fully understanding why for arbitrary operator its expectation value takes the form begin equation int psi ax psi dx end equation understand that the probability is given by begin equation int psi psi dx int psix 2dx end equation so equation makes sense to me as it is simply langle rangle int psix 2dx which is the value of the variable times the probability of being in that configuration as mentioned in the quote but for equation the arbitrary operator is color red text in between the psi and psix so unless can rewrite in the form of value times probability begin equation langle rangle int ax psi psi dx int psix 2dx end equation tag fail to see how equation gives the expectation value but already know that equation is wrong since in equation the operator is acting on psix so it doesnt make any sense to move the operator to the front of the integrand just to make it look like equation can anyone please explain to me why equation is justified as the expectation value even though the operator is in the middle
299504 is there any theoretical proof for the constant speed of light in all frames of references know it is experimentally proven but just curious
299526 know that if you are accelerating upward in an elevator you will have more weight if you are on scale due to normal force of the elevator pressing up into you would that happen if you are currently moving downward and negative velocity if you accelerate upward would that change the effect of acceleration on your weight
299608 if we neglect the danger of unsuccessful lift off of the rocket and the cost would it be physically possible to send all nuclear waste on earth to the sun will there be an obstacle that prevents this for example solar winds
299645 first of all ive read this other question is the universe linear if so why and im aiming at different kind of answer theories like general relativity or qft which are believed to be quite fundamental are strongly non linear however in the end both theories must be just low energy limits of an unified theory so this question arises could this unified theory be linear im looking for both mathematical and physical answer in other words id like to know if it is possible to make linear theory that has non linear low energy aproximations and if non linear universe would make any physical sense in view of the superposition principle
299721 this may be more of philosophical question than physics question but here goes the standard line is that nonrenormalizable qfts arent predictive because you need to specify an infinite number of couplings counterterms but strictly speaking this is only true if you want your theory to be predictive at all energy scales as long as you only consider processes below certain energy scales its fine to truncate your lagrangian after finite number of interaction terms or stop your feynman expansion at some finite skeleton vertex order and treat your theory as an effective theory indeed our two most precise theories of physics general relativity and the standard model are essentially effective theories that only work well in certain regimes although not quite in the technical sense described above as physicists were philosophically predisposed to believe that there is single fundamental theory that requires finite amount of information to fully specify which describes processes at all energy scales but one could imagine the possibility that quantum gravity is simply described by qft with an infinite number of counterterms and the higher energy the process you want to consider the more counterterms you need to include if this were the case then no one would ever be able to confidently predict the result of an experiment at arbitrarily high energy but the theory would still be completely predictive below certain energy scales if you wanted to study the physics at given scale youd just need to experimentally measure the value of the relevant counterterms once and then youd always be able to predict the physics at that scale and below so wed be able to predict that physics at arbitrarily high energies that we would have experimental access to regardless of how technologically advanced our experiments were at the time such scenario would admittedly be highly unsatisfying from philosophical perspective but is there any physical argument against it
299723 when am on earth the weight of my body is countered by the reaction of the ground so there is no net force acting on me but am spinning with earth but if there is no centripetal force then why am spinning and the equal air pressure on both side of my body wont be enough for me to stay in the same angular velocity as the earth is it just conservation of angular momentum
299738 what is the fate of photonic quantum that hits black wall how does this work with the conservation of energy and matter
299834 what are the reasons why we usually treat quantum field theory in momentum space instead of position space are the computations of feynman diagrams generally easier and are there other advantages of this formulation
300146 the earth takes hours to spin around its own axis and days to spin around the sun so in approximately half year the earth will have spun around its axis times now take look at the following picture assuming that the earth is in the position on the left is say on 1st of jan and in the position on the right half year after the earth will be roughly on the opposite side of the sun given that half year passed is that correct if at noon half year earlier that part of the earth was facing the sun then why wouldnt the opposite part of the earth be facing the sun now after complete rotations and the earth being on the opposite side of the sun we expect the noon time to occur on the dark side instead of the lighted side shouldnt this cause the am pm to switch the rotations made are consistent with passing days assuming its noon at both dates why does the earth face the sun at the same time on both sides of the sun
300242 got the main picture repeated over and over again about why if theres big bang we indeed should see the cmb with this feature in this question im asking something different what independent evidences do we have that the cmb is really related with what the universe was 400k years after the big bang and not just related with what the universe is now or just related with something else we dont yet know what are the effective evidences that is the result of the big bang as it is usually described if the list is too long would also appreciate one or two references
300309 today have learned what laplace transform is and how it is defined have heard that it has wide applications in physics engineering and so started to wonder started with probably the simplest function in all of physics distance formula in straight line movement with no acceleration dt vt where stands for distance for velocity and for time taking laplace transform of this function leads to mathscr dt frac now as the shows up in the exponential in the definition of the laplace transform along with it seems to me that it has to have dimensions of text time for it to make any physical sense this would suggest that is some sort of frequency but cannot understand what this new function tells us about the movement understand that perhaps im using this transform in wrong way place and it has no real physical in that particular case therefore would like to ask if there is any physical meaning in what have done if yes what meaning if no why
300551 did search the question on physics considering it would be previously asked found this how come wifi signals can go through walls and bodies by kitchen microwaves only penetrate few centimeters through absorbing surfaces but in this question the answers are to or in comparison with microwaves their absorption and certain other things didnt find sort of general answer that could be the answer to the question so the question is wifi or radio waves reach us through concrete walls they also reach us through the ceiling if some one is using it in the flat above ours even through the air they travel such lot bending around corners or doors now would not compare them to microwaves because dont want the answer in terms of properties of the material but physics visible light which is so much powerful than them cant penetrate black opaque paper leave alone the walls same is true for gamma rays penetration through very thick wall so why then radio waves being so very less powerful than light waves are able to travel through walls there should be general concept as to why the radio waves are able to pass through walls but microwaves or light waves cannot linked question is also that sound travels much faster in solidswalls but is not audible in it though it is in air after reading billns answer it would be really helpful if any one could explain it in terms molecular resonance or crystalline structure or electrical conductivity or how does molecular resonance or crystalline structure or electrical conductivity cause this
300568 assume that the linear charge density is the same for the charged infinite cylinder and the infinite line by gauss law know the charge enclosed is the same given gaussian cylinder of certain length and so the fields must be the same at any given distance from the axis of symmetry for both objects given that the distance is greater than the radius of the cylinder just dont understand intuitively why this is the case for charged infinite cylinder since the charges are distributed only on the surface of the cylinder shouldnt the field produced by the cylinder at distance being the radius of the cylinder from the axis of symmetry of the cylinder be greater in magnitude than that produced by an infinite line of charge at the same radius
300667 we know that text torque times and is the position vector but the position vector depends on the choice of the coordinate system and in turn on the choice of origin so where should we take the origin also do torque angular velocity and angular acceleration point of out the plane of rotation for 2d objects because otherwise they wouldnt have constant direction many sources including my textbook seem to say that the origin should lie on the axis and that it wouldnt make difference where it is on the axis but dont get why it shouldnt since position vector would be different from different origins and so the torque according to me might come out to be different
300718 was reading about heat flow when this came up consider an isolated metal plate which had been heated locally in some small region and allowed to evolve thereafter at some later time we measure the temperature txyz for all point pxyz in the metal plate this constitutes our initial conditions for the system we wish to simulate reverse heat flow with these initial conditions is this system chaotic that is do you suppose that small variation in the set of initial temperaturescaused by measurement errors will lead to huge difference in simulation of the system state at some earlier time
300782 in solar system we have all planets roughly on the same plane is it true for all of the star systems or at least for those that we have observed so far with multiple planets in our galaxy other galaxies if not are there any other patterns
300829 consider standard quantum harmonic oscillator frac 2m frac omega 2q we can solve this problem by defining the ladder operators and dagger one can show that there is unique ground state eigenvector psi with psi frac hbar omega psi and furthermore that given any eigenvector psi of with eigenvalue the vector dagger psi is also an eigenvector of with eigenvalue hbar omega however it is usually stated that we now have all eigenvectors of by considering all vectors of the form dagger psi how do we know that we have not missed any eigenvectors by this process how do we know that eigenvalues are only of the form frac hbar omega also slightly more technical question how do we know that the continuous spectrum of is empty the technical details am operating with are that mathcal mathbb and all operators are defined on schwartz space so that they are essentially self adjoint with their unique self adjoint extensions corresponding to the actual observables
301076 for example dont understand why the speed of satellite moving in an orbit of radius around the earth must be equal to sqrt gm if release particle in outer space with velocity perpendicular to the line joining the particle and earth but magnitude not equal to sqrt gm what will happen for al know the acceleration will still be perpendicular to its velocity at all instants and an always perpendicular acceleration is only capable of changing the direction of velocity continuously then wouldnt the particle still rotate even if its speed not equal to the one given by mv
301242 have read that destructive interference between water waves always leads to the creation of smaller waves which eventually die out why in particular for water waves it is hard to cancel each other
301267 my current understanding is this when current passes through resistor heat is generated which the resistor then gives off to the surrounding air that way the resistor is kept at roughly the same temperature so is constant which makes ohms law ir linear but in space the resistor doesnt have anywhere to put off the heat in that case will the resistor keep heating will that change its resistance in turn affecting the ir relation
301307 so it sounds like dumb question as it is very intuitive why rotation occurs however can you give me scientific explanation as to why whenever exert force on body it tends to move but when it is tied to something or am pushing it through the edge of an object it rotates what is there in body which lets it rotate in place of simply moving
302232 from learning about the lagrangian lately it seems that that it can underlie so many phenomena that it must be the unifying concept that underpins all physics often hear that physicists are searching for the theory of everything why is the lagrangian approach not considered to be such theory on related note can the lagrangian and or hamiltonian approach to describing system be considered the ultimate test of validity for any physical theory in other words is it necessary that every fundamental physical theory can be derived using the lagrangian approach
302269 have recently read that an orbital node in an atom is region where there is chance of finding an electron however have also read that there is an above chance of finding an electron practically anywhere in space and such is that orbitals merely represent areas where there is chance of finding an electron for example would just like to know if there truly is probability that an electron will be within region defined by the node many thanks
302307 reading on the no communication theorem and quantum teleportation have difficulty understanding the following thought experiment light source is emitting photons at regular intervals in vacuum the photons travel through geometry that disperses it in the desired directions something like diffraction aperture two observers in the same frame of reference as the source possess clocks synchronized with that of the light source observer d1 is nearer the source and will choose whether or not to observe each photon by time t1 observer d2 further from the source will observe every photon from the source observer d2 will not though be able to observe photons that have interacted at d1 because all their energy will be intercepted at d1 and will not propagate as far as d2 can the photon theoretically at least be delivered such that the interaction probability at d1 is and d2 is would it not possible to send bit stream from d1 to d2 if observer d1 intercepts photons to indicate false and moves their detector allowing photons to pass to indicate true this question is can observer d2 measurements determine what d1 did would the transmission time of the bit stream from d1 to d2 be independent of their separation dependent rather on the difference in their distance from the source if those assumptions were correct the message transmission could be made to exceed so suspect assumption is wrong
302342 claim is made in sean carrolls gr book multiple times that goes along the following lines given problem in relativity we can find solution with ease if we choose convenient reference frame for instance frame co moving with an object were interested in or if were in curved spacetime we could go to frame using locally inertial coordinates then we can find tensorial expression that reduces to the answer we found in our specific frame this tensorial expression will be the answer in any frame examples of this can be found in pages and of carrolls book my problem with this method is that im not so sure theres unique tensorial expression that can be extracted from an expression in specific frame of reference is there something that guarantees this uniqueness to me it seems intuitive that there could be multiple tensorial expressions that reduce to the same thing in the convenient frame we chose but yet give different results in other frames in this case the method wouldnt actually work
302370 have read that most stars are made mostly of plasma my questions in this statement are are there stars not made of plasma in what percentage stars are made of plasma
302445 used the same argument in the proof of equation of continuity to flow of stones suppose drop stones from the upper end of vertical pipe am continuously dropping the stones so that at any instant the pipe is full of stones the stones clearly have streamlines just like fluid flow because they have only straight line downward motion so after applying law of conservation of mass we get the equation of continuity for the stones since the stones are freely falling so they clearly come out of the pipe with speed greater than the initial speed so the area of lower end of the pipe should be smaller but this doesnt make sense because all the stones only have downward acceleration throughout their motion so theres no way their paths would have curved in the journey so that they come out of smaller area so hows this possible ive one confusion with the equation of continuity for fluid flow also if drop water from height with initial velocity zero and having some finite initial area of tube then the area of the tube after any finite time will be frac 1v so the water flow will have zero area after any finite time hows this possible
302487 we know that angular momentum is defined as the cross product of position and linear momentum by taking the time derivative we can deduce that the time rate of change of the angular momentum equals the net torque then why is the conservation of angular momentum considered law when we can easily show it is conserved when no net torque is applied by using newtons laws it truly confuses me
302553 as an exercise ive been trying to derive the biot savart law from the second set of maxwells equations for steady state current begin align nabla cdot mathbf nabla times mathbf mu mathbf end align ive been able to do this using the fact that an incompressible field has vector potential mathbf allowing me to rewrite the second equation as nabla mathbf mu mathbf which can be solved by components using the greens function for the laplacian yielding mathbf mathbf frac mu pi int frac mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf and since nabla times left psi mathbf right psi nabla times mathbf nabla psi times mathbf nabla times mathbf mathbf mathbf frac mu pi int frac mathbf times mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf as desired however if instead take the curl of both sides of amperes law and use the identity nabla times left nabla times mathbf right nabla nabla cdot mathbf nabla mathbf initially find that nabla nabla cdot mathbf nabla mathbf nabla mathbf mu nabla times mathbf which can again solve like poissons equation yielding mathbf mathbf frac mu pi int frac nabla times mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf which can be simplified using the identity psi nabla times mathbf nabla psi times mathbf nabla times left psi mathbf right giving mathbf mathbf frac mu pi int frac mathbf mathbf times mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf frac mu pi int nabla times left frac mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf right mathbf the first integral is precisely the biot savart law but have no idea how to make the second integral vanish ive exhausted any obvious vector calculus identities and stokes theorem doesnt help much im clearly missing an obvious mistake but havent been able to locate it this is similar to other questions that have been asked before but have specific question about step in the derivation which is not answered elsewhere
302633 why do we add minus sign in our formula for gravity when we might as well choose the unit vector instead of im just wondering why we choose this convention is it because its easier to remember that goes with edit actually is wikipedia right my syllabus says the following still my question holds why go through this trouble of adding minus sign
302795 have some sheets of polarization film they came in big box all stacked at the same angle noticed that the entire stack of them lets almost no light through even though theyre all at the same angle pulled out two and those two also block more light than just one why is this because have low grade polarizers or because lining them up at exactly the same angle is impossible or because the light that gets through the first one is not really polarized exactly to its angle its just that less of it is polarized away from its angle than before if its because these are low grade polarizers can anyone recommend linear polarizer that can stack several of in row at the same angle and still have probability of the light getting through feel like im probably just misunderstanding polarization theory so please correct me
302811 the curl in cylindrical coordinates is defined nabla times vec left frac rho frac partial partial varphi frac partial varphi partial right hat boldsymbol rho left frac partial rho partial frac partial partial rho right hat boldsymbol varphi frac rho left frac partial left rho varphi right partial rho frac partial rho partial varphi right hat mathbf for vector fields of the form vec frac rho hat varphi plotted below rho and varphi rho so the resulting field has zero curl but choosing frac mu pi results in the correct solution for the magnetic field around wire vec frac mu pi hat varphi this field cannot be curl free because of maxwells equations amperes law etc so must have made mistake somewhere why am calculating this field to be curl free
302825 background in any adiabatic quantum computer aqc algorithm we solve problems in the following manner we have an initial hamiltonian whose ground state is easy to find and problem hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the solution to our problem if we then evolve our aqc for time so that its energy is described by the hamiltonian ht th th then provided couple of conditions apply the system will be in the ground state of at time and voila we would have solution to our problem question if we just set up the aqc so its energy is initially described by the hamiltonian why wouldnt the system just fall into its ground state encoding solution to our problem immediately why do we need to evolve the aqc from the initial hamiltonian into
303234 am aware that there are independent infinitesimal lorentz transformations that can be separated into rotations and boosts is it possible for quantum field theory to be invariant under the boosts but not invariant under the rotations
303298 often read high level conceptual articles and news on the advances of particle physics in these statements are made along the lines of particle splits into particles and which exist for about billionth of second and then decay what am wondering is how an experimental physicist sees or deduces realise the particles are not observed directly what happens what does the fundamental data he investigates and bases his conclusions on actually look like and how is it obtained
303412 when jumping car battery the standard advice is to connect the red positive cable first whats the physics explanation for this
303724 understand that in vacuum monochromatic plane waves are transverse suppose that non monochromatic plane wave would also have this property as it can be decomposed using the fourier transform and each of its components would be transverse however what happens if the waves are not plane are they still transverse the only demonstrations ive found are used for plane waves so dont know if this is necessary condition or is just done for simplicity but can be generalized
303747 as the wmap and other satellite data have shown that universe is very nearly flat but the theories like general theory of relativity assume curved space to describe gravity so how can it be does it mean that space is curved around massive bodies and the whole universe is flat know we do not know the shape of the universe for sure but current data show it to be nearly flat

303815 what is the reason that the windows of ships bridges are always inclined as shown in the above picture
303844 am trying to understand how one obtains the galilean algebra from the poincare algebra specifically through the method of central extension im doing this by imposing that the generators of the poincare group scale with the velocity in certain ways and then taking the small velocity limit also was told should make the definition tag where is the hamiltonian and will turn out to be central element of the algebra now have been able to fine many of the commutation relations and they make sense match the galilean algebra but dont really understand how to show commutes with everything also is the physical interpretation that is the potential energy and is the kinetic energy
303977 if have an ice cube of lets say for example times times cm it was put inside container of internal dimensions times times cm and the container is strong so as not to allow compression will the cube melt when put at room temperature or will it just melt partially what will happen exactly
304212 was watching this video by veritasium note dont have much physics knowledge as understand at ligo they detect the gravitational waves that were generated by the collision of the two black holes how can they still measure these waves if the energy that they measure was released was only the last 10th of the seconds of the merging black holes as understand from the video as far as understand that would mean that there is only one peak that they can measure which is that 10th of second but their experiment seems to be going on many years and they have made many measurements how is this possible if the final collision was so short what do they really measure then edit basically my question comes down to was that once in lifetime chance of measuring the waves have they been sitting there waiting for the exact moment and then do measurement it isnt something they can measure everyday
304245 am confused some sources say it is possible at least theoretically http www wiskit com marilyn battleship jpeg and some say it is not true http blog knowinghumans net battleship would not float in bathtub html is it necessary or not that there exists an amount of water around the ship that weights at least the same as the weight of the ship
304370 so the kaon particle and the sigma particle are created very quickly through the strong interaction and decay slowly through the weak interaction how is this so is this not some kind of discrepancy what is the explanation for this an internet search has lead me to determine that it could be something to do with cp violation could it also be to do with the fact that they tend to decay into pions and protons dont want fully complex mathematical explanation just short qualitative one would be great its from past exam paper and is just short mark question
304651 according to this answer energy has some minimal mass associated with it therefore when lots of energy hits the earth such as solar radiation in hour period shouldnt the earth gain some small additional mass and if so how much
304776 the title of the question does not allow enough characters for clear statement of the question this is the question imagine that series of black holes are converging toward common center of gravity to simplify the scenario imagine the black holes are all of equal mass and therefore have identical event horizons they are approaching from identical distances from the center of mass with identical magnitudes of velocity it seems to me that if two of the black holes were approaching on opposite directions on the arbitrary axis and three were approaching on the plane with mutual angular separation of degrees that eventually the event horizons of the five black holes would begin to overlap of course other numbers of black holes and geometries could create similar phenomenon using euclidean geometry for analysis it appears that as the black holes continued to approach the common center of gravity there would be period of time where volume of normal space at the center is completely surrounded by composite event horizon then by shell consisting of the space within this common event horizon and then by continuous outer event horizon which in turn is surrounded by normal space so is there anything remarkable about this inner region of space is it still normal space it appears to be completely cut off from the rest of the universe to greater extent than is true even for the space within the event horizon of black hole normal space can communicate one way with inner event horizon space but there is no communication in either direction between core space and normal space also nothing within this core space or the core space itself ever actually crossed an event horizon yet it is completely surrounded by not one but two event horizons is there any reason to think any of the laws of physics would be different in this region of space as the black holes continued toward the center of gravity and this core space continues to contract would hawking radiation at the surrounding event horizon region increase exponentially and attempt to explode this structure consisting of concentric shell of space sandwiched between two event horizons and an inner core of normal space just as an atomic scale black hole is predicted to do could this process progress at the core space region to form the equivalent of an event horizon of an atomic scale mini black hole but with negative curvature edit it occurs to me that the event horizons of the approaching black holes may not actually merge there should be plane of zero net gravity intersecting at angle to line segment with the ends defined by any two centers of two black holes for equimassive black holes the line segment would be intersected at the midpoint of the line with increasing net gravity as the distance on either side of the plane increases but remaining below value that creates continuum of space with the black hole inner event horizon space this may result in continuous series of pathways of normal space connecting the inner or core space region with normal space surrounding the composite black hole system one commentator inquired whether the composite system could have rotation if rather than approaching black holes the three plane bhs were in the same orbit around the center of mass with degree angular separation and the two axis black holes were in orbit in perpendicular orbital plane or alternatively three black hole as in the plane then the composite system would have rotating elements of course the masses of the black holes in one orbital plane could be different than those in the other orbital plane such that the resultant two orbits did not intersect the orbital radii could be quite different perhaps such that the system could be gravitationally stable or quasi stable if the orbital speeds were high enough the hypothetical pathways between core space and external normal space could be changing so fast that any potential pathway from the exterior of the composite system would require speed greater than light for any matter energy to succeed in travelling through the pathway before it was swept away by an approaching event horizon there could still be continuous normal space connections between core space and external space but the core space region would still be effectively isolated from external normal space since no transfer of matter energy could occur between the two regions the commentator also inquired about what thought the inside event horizon might look like interpret this as what would be the surface topology of inner event horizon imagine in the simplest case it would be five sided three walls floor and ceiling with each wall and the floor and ceiling having convexity with radius of curvature equal to that of the black hole event horizons of course this core space regions would be extremely black perhaps the blackest region of space that is theoretically possible interestingly if the orbital model of this system included black hole as the center of mass of the system the core region would then be shell of space bounded by single inner event horizon and the two outer event horizons so this inner shell space would be contained within three event horizons
304837 for few days was thinking of this question lets assume we have simple circuit that is meters long and lets say that we have bulbs and connected to the circuits 30th 60th and 90th meter relatively from the side when we switch the system on would all the bulbs light up at the same time or would light up first and last or the opposite
304859 was working on problem with electrons acting as waves in diffraction part of the question asked me to calculate the momentum of the electron since was dealing with waves used the following equation implies since we can substitute that in resulting in hf substituting in the de broglie into the above equation we get since were talking about electrons the only energy that the electron has is kinetic so we can substitude 5mv into the equation giving us 5mv 5mv ive repeat that 5mv any 4th grade physicist knows that momentum is mv so on one hand have mv and on the other have derivation saying the momentum is 5mv is there mistake in my derivation im not seeing noticed something bit later implies pv mv see any similarities between this and another infamous equation in the realm of relativity
304992 guess it has something to do with their being both high horizontal and vertical velocity components during re entry but again wouldn that mean there is better reentry maneuver that the one in use
304993 gallon litre bulk chemical storage railcar can store products with vapor pressures in excess of psia mpa the same railcar can not withstand vacuum when being unloaded want to understand why bulk chemical storage car in this example assume refrigerant on warm day is unique in its design in the sense that it is pressure vessel contains well over psig mpa internal pressure whereas many metal tanks are rated for far lower pressures thus the pressure differential between atmosphere and the inside of the metal tank may be typically be close to the difference found in this example psi kpa or less the definition of metal tanks can be open to interpretation not only with regard to pressure ratings but also wall thicknesses one of the answers posed refers to plastic or aluminum soda containers the material properties are far different than those typically found in the types of rail cars have presented here
305093 superstring theory proposes that our universe includes fundamental strings that vibrate in possibly dimensions to describe how this occurs in our universe string theorists strominger and witten among other prominent theorists propose that space is composed of particular type of calabi yau cy manifold these manifolds can accommodate the vibrations of strings in the required ten dimensions the problem is that there are at least possible different cy manifolds and so far there is no theoretical way to determine if superstring theory is true which one of these or more cy manifolds is the cy manifold for the space of our universe my question is is there any way to mathematically completely rule out even one of the possible cy manifolds as the manifold that accommodates string vibrations in our universe
305246 am considering the equation for simple harmonic motion which is ddot omega 2x to solve this have seen three approaches this is confusing as do not know which approach is physically correct or if there is no correct approach what is the physical significance of the three different approaches my guess is that the first approach is slightly redundant as it is only using the well known result of cosine and sin solutions of this form of second order differential equation which was derived from using methods of the full solution using phi as in the the second and third approaches however do not know which of these is correct or why we can view it in two different ways assume the sin and cosine results cosine and sine are both solutions of the above equation so the full solution is linear combination of the two cos omega sin omega which is equivalent to cos omega phi giving the common form solve more generally for complex have seen the equation also be solved by solving the homogeneous differential equation for ae omega be omega then the constants are used to give the real solution so the boundary condition that is real yields that so here we have complex constants and we get the result cos omega ia sin omega rea cos omega ima sin omega which as before with constants multiplying sin and cos terms reduces to cos omega phi the final approach have seen is by solving the differential equation for and just setting rez solving the equation for gives ae omega be omega where believe if got the method correctly the constants are here real as this still reduces to cos omega ia sin omega but this time for real and and therefore is complex number you can see that this is equivalent to de phi omega where the complex amplitude component phi rotates the complex number omega in the complex plane such that the ratio of the constants of the cosine and sin terms of is correct and as given in the cos omega ia sin omega form of this reduces to omega phi yielding rez cos omega phi as before as mentioned am not sure which is the correct way to approach this if any but there must at least be physical significance to tackling this in the different methods which would be grateful if someone could explain some of the thoughts have had so far are the first sin and cos solution is just shortcut using the known result derived from the more formal solution using phi however the sin cos form only applies when the variable in the differential equation is real for example it gives the correct solution for real but if had complex in there which knew was meant to be complex then assuming the sin cos form would be wrong and would not give the complete solution picture it would only give the real component of the difference between the second and third approaches seems to be that in one case we know we have complex variable in that case we actually find that the constants can be real although think they may also be not real provided that neq this still yields complex as the complex parts do not cancel out and in the second case we find that the constants must be real and that such that we get real as mandated by the boundary conditions so considering this cant quite see how approaches and above would yield the same form through these two different ways using boundary conditions for complex and so that complex parts cancel or allowing to be complex and thus neq and making the real part of this complex solution apologies for the long post hope have made my confusion and thoughts sufficiently clear
305501 lets say have charged particle in front of me if start spinning in place the charged particle will appear accelerated to me from my reference frame if the laws of physics pertaining to this scenario are valid in all reference frames if spin with with an appropriate angular velocity to bring the emitted waves into the visible light spectrum will see light if there are many such particles will the entire room light up for me and remain dark for stationary observer next to me
305563 one of the main reasons why we havent switched to clean energy is the lack of efficient storage methods but why arent we using dead weights to store energy and draw it back later when needed as an example of what mean
305627 moving magnet induces current in conductor then shouldnt we be able to generate electricity through manual labour was thinking about building gym that used magnets as weights people would lift the magnets up and down creating change in flux generating current for example the exercise bikes and the rowing machines would definitely be able to produce current due to their rotating discs also machines like squat stand can be turned into generator because the weight can be turned into magnet the key idea is that any machine that can move can turn into generator to produce electricity for homes there should be many gyms spread out along the city like mini power stations the electricity generated doesnt have to be used straight away but can also be stored in battery for later use am wondering if there will be enough electricity generated to supply homes if not all homes then street or two

306013 this press release by nist titled nist physicists squeeze light to cool microscopic drum below quantum limit makes the following claim the new technique theoretically could be used to cool objects to absolute zero the temperature at which matter is devoid of nearly all energy and motion nist scientists said im not sure thats exactly what the nist scientists said nor what they meant im very suspicious of anyone who claims to be even theoretically capable of reducing mechanical system to absolute zero the full publication itself is at sideband cooling beyond the quantum backaction limit with squeezed light clark et al nature arxiv can someone with access to the actual article in nature clarify whether the news article at nist was accurately reporting on the content of the nature article regarding achieving absolute zero the abstract instead references cooling arbitrarily close to the motional ground state im not looking for debate about whether or not reaching absolute zero is possible nor discussion about the discrepancies in definitions of absolute zero just want someone to clear up the probable discrepancy between what nist wrote and what nature published
306036 suppose have source object that is not time varying to be concrete lets say its galaxy is there anything additional that can be learned or done with multiple short exposure images of exactly the same field as compared to single long exposure given that the total integration time is identical im thinking of things along the lines of noise suppression background removal image processing magic so far the only thing can think of is that long exposure could saturate the detector im thinking ccd here short exposures could avoid this allowing for accurate photometry across the entire image ive tagged this astronomy since thats the area of application im most familiar with but perspectives from other fields are welcome

306438 while reasoning that why particle can not be accelerated to light speed it is argued that the mass momentum approaches infinity as speed approaches think it is per gr am sure this also fits into mathematics otherwise people would not be making this argument may be wrong and please feel free to correct me if you think so but do not think that is the case mass momentum does not approach infinite my simple argument is if the mass momentum of moving particle approaches infinite and such particle moving at speeds close to then it would be almost impossible to stop that particle in other words it should be equally difficult impossible to slow it down we all know that though it is not possible to accelerate the particle further but it is no big deal to slow it down slowing down an infinite mass momentum would not be that easy infinite mass reasoning must apply both ways in speeding up as well as in slowing down has it been experimentally shown that it also applies to slowing down at limits close to therefore can argue that mass momentum does not approach infinite it is the forces that are rendered ineffective at such speeds because the force itself propagates at and can not accelerate anything as fast as itself or faster force is rendered ineffective only in direction of motion acceleration not in opposite direction slowing down analogy how force may become ineffective in way we can not accelerate car that is already going at miles hr by pushing with our hands because humans can not move their hand as fast but we can accelerate car going at miles an hour as the speed gets closer and closer to that of force the force can not push it any more same way as we can not move our hand faster than miles hr and can not accelerate that car by pushing on it but slowing down would be effective dangerous and fatal though please correct if am missing something instead of blank down voting considering formula given by john rennie in his answer the momentum of an object of mass moving at velocity is gamma frac mv sqrt frac which goes to infinity as to in the limit of ll the lorentz factor gamma approx and we recover the newtonian approximation same math can be applied to effectiveness of the force only thing is that is the velocity only positive component in the direction of the force so for slowing down it will be or gamma approx the effective force f1 when particle is moving at velocity and force is applied gamma f1 frac f1 sqrt frac this way the math does not change either so at limits close to the force must be fully effective in slowing down and pretty much ineffective in accelerating am proposing below experiment to prove disprove the concept if someone is aware of such an experiment being done please share the results make particle accelerate at highest speed that the accelerator can achieve once this speed is achieved continue to apply the force for another minute the particle should gain negligible speed during this minute but should gain lot of momentum per momentum formula now stop the accelerating force and start an equal slowing force reverse the force per the current infinite mass momentum explanation minute of slowing should reduce the speed by negligible same speed that was gained during last minute of acceleration because force is rate of change of momentum and same force in both directions should cause same change of momentum speed during same amount of time but per my explanation lot more slowing down will take place during the minute because gamma becomes zero for slowing down think evidence and results of such experiment being done can answer this question definitively but equivalent other answers would help too like evidence of the tev energy of protons being physically measured rather than just being calculated via the momentum formula

307026 im struggling with the concept of natural variables in thermodynamics textbooks say that the internal energy is naturally expressed as usvn for an ideal gas could take the sackur tetrode equation which gives me suvn and solve for to get frac 3nh pi left frac left exp left frac nk right frac right right usvn however have never seen this expression before usually people invoke the equipartition theorem to get frac utn or they use the ideal gas law to get frac frac pv upv so sticking with the example of the ideal gas this motivates the following questions what is natural about usvn compared to utn and upv can derive the expressions for utn and upv from usvn can derive usvn from utn and upv note that this question is not about the legendre transformation between different thermodynamic potentials but about expressing the same thermodynamic potential in terms of different variables

307654 in the framework of classical electrodynamics at distances much greater than conductors dimension the field ought to approach that of point charge located at the conductor but where at for highly symmetric conductor we ought to be able to deduce some information about the point charge location yet consider an arbitrarily shaped conductive body is the point located at the centroid edit am not questioning why we approximate source as point charge at far distances this question regards geometrical convergence in physical scenario if the field lines converge to that of point charge they emanate from point are there known relations between the point and the body itself
307714 my question is the following imagine that we study two electrons one has spin up and the other down if the two wavefunctions overlap then have the symetrisation postulate that occurs the state will be frac rangle rangle sqrt but do you agree with me that if the wavefunctions dont overlap can distinguish my two electrons so can write in that case psi rangle rangle and the reason behind is because in fact there will be other quantum numbers acting here my state will be in fact something like psi rangle rangle phi rangle otimes rangle phi rangle and because phi and phi dont overlap then it allows me to distinguish my particles they act like other quantum numbers if my particles were point like could write phi rangle rangle and phi rangle rangle for example just want to be sure that understood well the mathematical reason behind when it doesnt overlap dont have to symmetrise my ket edit have read pauli principle for particles very far apart from each other the first answer for example when he says psi vec vec psi vec vec but dont understand this if the particles dont overlap indeed without an overlap can label the identicals particles by mind if the particle is on earth and the particle is on the moon without any overlapping and if take as cooordinate on earth and as coordinate on the moon then psi vec vec neq but psi vec vec because the first particle cant be on moon because it is on earth

308494 how does covalent bonding actually work consider the molecule which has double covalent bond between the oxygen molecules chemistry texts say that double covalent bond occurs because this gives each oxygen eight valence electrons which is the most stable configuration understand that the octet rule works for single atom because the 3s state is much higher in energy than the 2p state however im not sure how this applies to two atom molecule there are two ways to explain it if were naive and say that the electron quantum states of are just the states of the original two oxygen molecules then its impossible to fill all of the 1s 2s and 2p states because there just arent enough electrons in chemistry class we get around this by double counting covalently bonded electrons somehow they can count as valence electrons on two atoms at once but how can single electron be in two quantum states at once less naively we could say that the orbitals are made by combining the individual atomic orbitals of the oxygen atoms together however in this case the octet rule doesnt make sense to me because the molecule orbitals look completely different in this picture how does the octet rule picture of completely filled shell survive
308580 this is request for references mainly for educational aims in textbooks about general relativity it is common to present the riemann and ricci tensors using the christoffel symbols this is easy to understand because it is straightforward way to perform practical computations and the formulas one obtains are elegant and easy to grasp besides christoffel symbols are given through the metric and one can do some algebra to get such kind of expressions but for my aims would need references rather than do the computations reporting formulas giving the ricci tensor using the metric explicitly also research papers are fine can anybody help

308735 according to the wikipedia article on night vision many animals have better night vision than humans do the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes these include having larger eyeball larger lens larger optical aperture the pupils may expand to the physical limit of the eyelids more rods than cones or rods exclusively in the retina and tapetum lucidum but recent study has shown that the human eye is capable of detecting individual photons of visible light it seems to me that this should be the highest physically possible sensitivity to light since qed requires excitations of the field to be quantized into integer numbers of photons how is it possible for animals to have better night vision than humans if humans can detect individual light quanta is it just that while the human eye can sometimes detect individual photons other animals eyes can do so more often

309019 beta minus decay emits an electron with range of energies within the nucleus the following is happening rightarrow bar for this reaction to be possible by lepton number conservation the neutrino must be present since this neutrino accounts for the range of electron energies can this not be used to be constraint on the mass of the neutrino for the maximum electron energy the neutrino will have no kinetic energy and only its mass energy mc so how come this principle has not been utilised in putting limits on neutrino mass energies there must be problem somewhere
309043 it is common for introductory courses in quantum physics to justify the need for new model with the ultraviolet catastrophe but cannot seem to grasp it the flaw in the rayleigh jeans law appears to be that it suggests an always increasing intensity relative to an increasing frequency and thus implies an infinite energy source however struggle to see how the model explains even observations they would have made at the time such as why things glow red when heated graphs such as these suggest that the intensity of blue light would be so much higher than red light that nothing could ever glow red what am missing

310060 theres famous claim along the lines of dp of pi are sufficient to calculate the circumference of the observable universe to the width of hydrogen atom dont know the accuracy and detail of claim but it prompted me to be curious assume that the claim if it were true and accurately remembered if equivalent to stating there are orders of decimal magnitude difference between the diameter of the universe and the diamater of hydrogen atom but thats not the biggest possible difference between interestingly measurable things because the diameter of hydrogen atom isnt the smallest length we could go smaller protons electrons quarks planck length dont know astrophysics well enough to know whether theres anything thats interesting to describe bigger than the observable universe but it seems that whilst considering length you can arrive at the greatest possible difference in orders of magnitude but there are other things that can be measured time for example so question what metric has the greatest range of orders of magnitude that are interesting to talk about and how big is that range
310391 one of the basic ingredients of quantum mechanics is the possibility of working in different pictures thus while we normally work in the schr dinger picture in which states evolve according to the schr dinger equation partial psit rangle psit rangle it is sometimes convenient to work in the heisenberg picture in which you set the state of the system as fixed and evolve the operators themselves through the heisenberg equation frac mathrm mathrm dt at hat frac partial partial or even in weird hybrid of those two called the interaction picture generally speaking textbooks do good job of explaining the commonalities and differences between those three showing that they are equivalent and demonstrating how one can change from one picture to another however theres one question thats often left unanswered and it then hangs in the air over the whole proceedings giving them an unwarranted air of mystery in the eyes of first timer what is in the abstract picture in this sense this is part of what makes the formalism slightly unsettling to newcomer because the use of the phrase schr dinger picture implies that the schr dinger is is an adjective or modifier on the general term picture but that general term is never explained moreover the heisenberg and schr dinger pictures are usually presented as very different formalisms and its hard for beginner to see how they can be understood as two versions of the same thing if you could have that then picture would be way to specialize the general formalism but again that is rarely explained in introductory texts
310472 lets consider the following system shaped as in the picture below in which the only fluid contained is water at room temperature as far as understand the water should be in an equilibrium between its liquid and gaseous phases while some of the liquid water at the bottom continuously evaporates due to vapor pressure some of the water vapour molecules will cluster into droplets causing condensation solid surfaces such as the ceiling and walls of this system are likely sites for this condensation because they reduce the energy barrier that needs to be overcome for this nucleation to take place however when try to bring gravity into the equation im struck by what seems to me like remarkable asymmetry any water droplets condensed against the ceiling of the container have greater potential gravitational energy than the liquid molecules at the bottom the stalactite esque spire protruding from the ceiling takes advantage of waters surface tension to direct trickle of water onto tiny waterwheel below powering tiny turbine going in the other direction any evaporated water molecules that end up condensed against the ceiling seem to do so without any input of external energy gas molecules will travel in any direction throughout container spontaneously reaching the upper regions merely through their own energetic brownian motions trading heat for gravitational energy if you will while apparently decreasing entropy of the entire system over time violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics while summoning maxwells demon that cant be right right nb it deserves mention that condensation produces heat whereas evaporation consumes heat the resulting temperature differences should remain constant though given that convection and conduction would keep the system in thermodynamic equilibrium between the sites of evaporation and condensation using thermally conductive materials in between top and bottom copper container walls is just one measure that can be taken to minimize the temperature difference of this equilibrium
310671 never had problem accepting that spacetime is curved as result of matter until learned the ligo experiments showed that evidently the curvature of spacetime can be measured this to me is very strange suppose the entire universe is empty except for two people floating in space meters apart since their masses are so small spacetime is almost entirely flat compared to the conditions on the surface of earth then suddenly some incredibly huge cosmic event happens and unthinkably large gravitational waves pass through the area somehow this doesnt kill them spacetime goes all spaghetti and these two dudes are just shaking all over like jellyfish but if space itself is changing how would they know they should observe at all times that they are still meters apart since they are not moving in space but space is moving with them in it right or maybe would each guy think that he is remaining still while the other one just goes totally nuts if the changing curvature of spacetime can be measured what if these two guys were each holding one end of meter pole seems to me being measurable would imply that or one or both would have to lose grip and then have to dodge the end as it comes back this is probably well explored question and just dont know the answer looked around on physics se and saw lot of questions like this very informative one and this one that assumes the effects are noticeable but none of them seem to be quite what im looking for

311127 conventional wisdom tells us that magnetic field lines must either form closed loops or shoot off to infinity however this leaves out the possibility that magnetic field line even if it stays confined inside compact region of space can in principle come back to close to its starting point but miss it forming quasi loop that never quite closes in particular suspect its possible to set this up using twisted torus magnetic field like the ones in tokamak where by controlling the relative strengths of the toroidal and poloidal components one can engineer situations where magnetic field lines close upon themselves after mathrm toroidal loops around the torus and mathrm poloidal loops about it but one can also engineer things such that this never quite happens and the magnetic field line occupies dense subset of surface or even dense subset of space image source alas in looking for an explicit expression for such field got drowned in technical results for tokamaks and magnetic fields in neutron stars so ill just leave this here in case someone wants to have crack at it is this possible im for now mostly interested in results for this specific configuration but if this configuration wont work if some result guarantees that field lines in this setting do close upon themselves then im also interested in examples from further afield
311145 am not physics student so please pardon me if this sounds silly because might be mixing irrelevant things here and am not even getting how to ask my question my main question is does light travels at the same speed irrespective of from where who how the light is created generated assuming light travelling in vacuum meaning the light coming from candle or beam from lazer gun or sun rays or light coming from any other star takes same time to travel from point to point does energy and force what caused that light to be generated has any impact on how fast they move when think of moving of photons my basic physics knowledge which learnt in childhood tells me that for moving anything some force has to be applied and speed and distance of the object depends on how much force is applied am hoping its same for the photons too in that case what wonder is the light from match stick lighter torch lazer sun or any bigger and larger star is same they will be same unless all applies same force to the photon
311468 assumptions the universe is flat currently supported the universe is simply connected the edges arent glued together as in torus the universe contains finite mass and energy conclusion the universe must have an edge yes there is similar question here how can the universe be flat and have no center if universal mass energy content is finite but my question is not answered in fact people are neatly dodging the notion of an edge by suggesting unusual topologies this is purely hypothetical question but since everyone says the universe has no edge and is flat am forced to ask the obvious space or some form of truly empty vacuum might go on forever but if matter energy are finite in the universe then eventually if we travel far enough past the cosmic horizon well find that there are no more stars no more galaxies no more photons and no more anything unless the universe is actually sphere in which case eventually well end up back where we started is there flaw in my reasoning must have read articles today to get to the bottom of this
311522 nearly every explanation of oil drop experiment ever found concludes along the lines of the charge on the droplets were thus measured and were all found to be integral multiple of cdot rm how exactly do you get this random number mean could say they were all integral multiples of cdot and ill still be right since in fact can just divide by any number and conclude that it is the fundamental unit of charge since the charge on the droplets is multiple of it until and unless we are certain that drop gained exactly one electron and measure it there is no way to conclude the value of isnt it

311606 found after searching that this question has been asked before but all the answers were not convincing suppose have body which is free not constrained always rotate about its center of mass why is that so convincing answer that found was that in most cases moment of inertial about center of mass is the least and thats why the body rotates about the center of mass but ask it again with hope of the question not getting closed and getting better succint answer edit was thinking that motion about the com is the most stable one and the rotation about other points degenerates dont think its right is it
311652 in this paper was written about the effects of radiation on solar panels the paper states that when electrons at energies greater than kev and protons at energies greater than 98ev bombard silicon crystal they can displace an atom from the crystal lattice producing lattice vacancy and recoil atom which comes to rest as an interstitial atom however the resting energies of electrons and protons are far greater than this at roughly kev and mev respectively concluded that the paper was referring to kinetic energy rather than total energy and adjusted my calculations based on this conjecture so was correct to assume that the paper referred to kinetic energy or was it instead some other measure of the particles energy more generally is there standard meaning for particles energy when referring to such particles moving at relativistic speeds

313740 here is quote from introduction to quantum mechanics by david griffiths the general solution is linear combination of separable solutions as were about to discover the time independent schroedinger equation equation yields an infinite collection of solutions psi 1x psi 2x psi 3x each with its associated value of the separation constant thus there is different wave function for each allowed energy psi 1x psi 1xe ie hbar quad psi 2x psi 2xe ie hbar ldots now as you can easily check for yourself the time dependent schroedinger equation equation has the property that any linear combination5 of solutions is itself solution once we have found the separable solutions then we can immediately construct much more general solution of the form psix sum infty psi nxe ie hbar tag am trying to understand it in this way the time independent schroedingers equation hat psi psi an eigenvalue equation ax lambda yields an infinite collection of solutions psi 1x psi 2x psi 3x dots has eigen vectors dots each with its associated value of separation constant dots each with its associated eigen value lambda lambda lambda dots thus there is different wave function for allowed energy psi 1xt psi 1xe ie 1t hbar quad psi 2xt psi 2xe ie 2t hbar dots have equations as ax lambda 1x qquad ax lambda 2x dots once we have found the separable solutions then we can immediately construct much more general solution of the form psixt sum infty psi nxe nt hbar forgetting the any other variable dependence we can construct more general solution of the form sum this last equation doesnt make any sense to me there is nothing in linear algebra that says that this last equation logically precedes the previous equations trying to understand from linear algebra what does the last equation mean why is the general solution of schroedingers equation linear combination of the eigenfunctions
313758 always feel unsure about the definitions of phase and phase transition first lets discuss in laudaus paradigm for example some people say that phase is classified by symmetry some people say that phase is classified by order parameter and that phase transition is when there is some discontinuity in free energy does this mean that gas and liquid are the same phase because in the phase diagram they are connected and they have the same symmetries translations and rotations if they are not the same phase what should we call the state of large pressure and large temperature liquid or gas does this mean that above the critical point the transition from gas to liquid is not phase transition but below the critial point the transition from gas to liquid is phase transition if the answers to my first and second question are yes does this mean that even in the same phase there can still be phase transition this conclusion is so weird in landaus paradigm whats the symmetry breaking and order parameter in the gas liquid phase transition it seems that the symmetry is same in gas and liquid gas liquid phase transition must be able to be explained by landaus paradigm but landaus paradigm says that there must be symmetry breaking in phase transition there is an answer admit that from modern point of view phase transition is not necessarily due to symmetry breaking but dont think that gas liquid transition has been beyond landaus paradigm up to now we only talk about the classical phase transition if we consider the general paradigm we know that symmetry breaking must imply phase transition but phase transition dont imply symmetry breaking for example in gauge ising model we can prove there is no symmetry breaking and local magnet is always zero but we can choose wilson loop as order parameter and find there is confined and deconfined phase so if given one phase we first find the symmetry is same in this phase and then check that several other order parameters are also the same in this phase however how do you prove that there is no weird order parameter that in one part of this phase is zero and in another part of this phase is nonzero for example in solid phase of water which has the same crystal structure how to prove that any order parameter that you can construct will not be zero in one part of the phase and nonzero in other part
313923 have lot of solid objects that were exposed to the sun for many years and obviously they changed their color write obviously because know it empirically and from other people but what is actually happening in the material are the photons from the sun knocking electrons or what is going on at an atomic level or is the heat accelerating the oxidation process can anyone help me to understand and visualize this phenomenon

314185 when an object falls through vacuum gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy is there some way to get electrical energy out of the equation by itself somehow convert the gravitational potential energy to electrical energy is this physically possible if so what properties must this object have by by itself mean without using any external possibly stationary reference object stationary coil so magnet falling through coil does not count the electricity is generated solely by the object that is falling note that the object itself can be arbitrarily complex internally just that whatever mechanism it has inside must also be falling along with the object

316848 in photoelectric effect of theory of spectral lines an electron takes the entire or none of the energy of the photon it absorbs the entire quanta not its fractions resulting in the disappearance of the photon but in compton effect the electron takes only fraction of the photon energy and the photon stays alive what specifically want to know is that quantum theory says that an electron will either take the whole or none of the photon energy why then in compton effect the electron takes fraction of the photon energy is that allowed by quantum theory or is not so or the electron takes up photon only when in an energy level when an electron is free can it absorb half the energy of photon edit still dont get whether the electrons are allowed to take the energy of the whole photon when they are in energy levels and can they absorb fraction of the photon energy when they are free
316936 so this is question that has been puzzling me for numerous reasons be it for advocating nuclear power or getting bit of nerd rage when watching sci fi work or having an argument with someone pretty much everyone knows that you need as much u235 you can get in given concentration of uranium to make bomb thats feasible and practical since the presence of u238 slows down the reaction so working that backwards is there concentration of u238 to u235 where its impossible for it to become supercritical because there are too many u238 atoms absorbing the neutrons and thus cannot trigger nuclear detonation have looked at the wiki for it https en wikipedia org wiki enriched uranium highly enriched uranium 28heu if am reading the second to last sentence on the first paragraph correctly that would mean any uranium that is below enrichment would be physically incapable of undergoing nuclear detonation regardless of mass of uranium involved but im not sure am interpreting what they have to say correctly so am asking here for further clarification since reactor grade uranium is only enriched that should mean it is impossible for that grade of uranium to ever achieve nuclear detonation even if you tried there is also blurb about this notion fact in this chernobyl footage but given its age and lack of explanation as to why im not sure this is valid source https youtu be cc vvhwxl9qt 14m50s so if got all my duck in row and understanding this correctly assuming enriched uranium is being used would it be accurate to say that nuclear reactors of the above parameters cannot and wont ever explode in the sense of an atom bomb
317226 am an undergraduate neuroscientist and recently have been studying probability distributions in relation to information theory and came across the definition of the dirac delta as singular distribution my mathematical maturity is relatively low seeing as am only just now taking multivariable calculus so bear with me if my understanding is not very deep understand that the dirac delta is rule of the form begin equation delta phi phix end equation which assigns to each value of the test function phix its value at namely phix also understand the proof by negation which shows that there is no regular distribution which satisfies this property making the delta singular distribution my confusion arises in the physicists notation of delta which understand to be an abuse of notation begin equation deltax phi int infty infty deltax phixdx phix end equation so my question is twofold what mathematical power does one gain by representing the dirac delta as such and why does the notation come in it seems that it could just as easily be written begin equation delta phi int infty infty deltax phixdx phix end equation since this notation is simply the physicist imagining that some function which satisfies this distribution exists even though one does not
317359 it is said that in spaceship you need to spend as much energy to brake as you spent for accelerating an electric car however charges its batteries while braking thus it actually recovers energy by braking both facts somehow seem intuitive to me but arent these two observations contradicting each other addendum looking at the answers realize the quastion might not have been clear enough so let me pose the question in different way do you absolutely need an outside object moving at different speed the road for car slamming into an atmosphere as space ship to convert kinetic energy into another form what is the fundamental principle
317521 how can the direction of the electric field of negative point charge be going in towards itself radially when the charge itself is generating the electric field is it generated at infinity then because if its generated by the charge then it cannot go further in towards itself in case of positive charge it is understandable that the field is being generated at the charge at its surface to be precise and is going outwards radially

317899 when astronomers physicists say that space is expanding does the definition of space include matter energy and the particles within or is space an empty stage in which all of the above exist if its empty then the expansion is just the movement of all matter energy etc away from one another and the red shift quantifies that so why do we call it the expansion of space isnt that like multiplying zero by factor to try and make it bigger
317989 in charge free region electric field lines can be taken to be continuous curves without any breaks what is meant by charge free region suppose it means absence of any external charge what if some other charge is present near the source of the field will it make the field lines discontinuous why does it state that field lines can be taken to be continuous are they not exactly continuous
318178 is the speed of causality or frac epsilon where is the speed of light in vacuum and epsilon is the dielectric constant of the medium searched the net but could not find good and relevant answer there was this but it did not address the main concern so will an electron travelling at 99c in water where the speed of light is actually frac violate causality
318286 the large hadron collider at low power accelerates particles such that much of the total energy provided goes towards increasing their kinetic energy and their masses increase to some extent as well and so newtons equations are valid for this situation however when its turned onto high power as the particles tend to the speed of light any additional power provided by the accelerator increases mostly the masses of the particles and their kinetic energy increases only slightly that is why these high energy particles can pack quite punch its sort of like taking car and propelling it such that it transforms into massive freight train this is very stupid question but bet ill get some really remarkable answers if the power output of the large hadron collider were infinite or at least very big number and notwithstanding failure or limitation of the mechanical and engineering aspects of the machinery would it eventually explode if the power is turned up too high
318397 while reading my text came across two statements as follows speed of alpha particle is characteristic speed as it depends on nature of nucleus beta particle come out from same nucleus with different speeds so it is not characteristic speed now am unable to understand why alpha particle speed depends on nucleus and why not then beta also are these just observation or there is something theoritically to say about these observations

318976 was wondering about the differences between electricity and magnetism in the context of maxwells equations when thought over it came to the conclusion that the only difference between the two is that magnetic monopoles do not exist is this right next one now searched for the equations with magnetic monopoles and found them at wikipedia they seem quite symmetrical except the constants of course except two major differences it is nabla times mathbf frac partial mathbf partial mu mathbf mathrm but nabla times mathbf mu epsilon frac partial mathbf partial mu mathbf mathrm this means that the induced magnetic emf if may call it that is produced by changing electric fields and currents in the exact opposite sense mean direction to the counterpart phenomenon of electromagnetic induction why so is there lenz law for magnetic emf induction also also the lorentz force on magnetic charges mathbf mathrm mathbf mathbf times frac mathbf why this minus sign in the force on magnetic charges that does not appear in the lorentz force on electric charges
319040 my mother came back from market which bags the products in paper bags with handles and asked me to move the bags from the trunk of the car to the house being the lazy human am hung few bags on each arm so could cut the number of trips back and forth as was walking to the front door the handles of bag tore the bag plummeting to the concrete ground glass jar of peppers had been smashed in to zillion little pieces as you might expect my mother was furious youre so lazy if you hadnt hung so many on your arm the peppers and their jar would still be intact disagree heres why scenario lazy scenario peppers conclusion note that bag will have on it regardless of bag bs existence sure my arm had but it wasnt the thing that broke so conclude that the tearing of the bag was inevitable and that the peppers fates were written by someone other than me manufacturer didnt put enough glue to handle expected weight cashier put more weight than permitted etc is my reasoning correct or am missing something that proves that im guilty
319123 have wondered that in an octave in piano there are seven primary notes and also we observe mostly seven primary colors of rainbow know we perceive logarithmically that means we only care about relative differences is there any relation between musical notes in an octave and colors of rainbow edit agree that the primary term for the notes in an octave is more or less the matter of taste however if we take the western musical taste as guide we can justify ourselves to use notes in an octave and place piano keys in the present way take look at here
319235 is there only one reversible way to move from one state to another if we consider two states and on an isotherm and we move from to by first reversible isochoric process and then reversible isobaric process now the path followed should be reversible since both the processes were reversible but what about simply following the reversible isothermal process according to me both processes should be reversible now entropy is the heat added reversibly to move from one state to another divided by the temperature at which it is added but we know that the heat added to the system is different in both the cases then how is entropy state function

321799 recently when reading about the black hole information paradox many authors have said that any state in quantum field theory looks like the vacuum at sufficiently short distances one example from recent review by marolf is first recall that at sufficiently short distances any state of our quantum field will be well approximated by the vacuum we must then also recall that the vacuum of quantum field theory contains divergent ultraviolet correlations between spacelike separated points have not managed to find detailed explanation why this should be so either by doing quick search on google or looking at my qft textbooks so would appreciate if either detailed explanation with all the maths or at least heuristic with maybe link to some book article could be given
321811 it is common place here for lattice qcd calculations to be computed using reference masses such as the pion mass which are greater that the physical values of those quantities sometimes multiple calculations are done at various heavier values so as to extrapolate down to the physical value the problem with this is that qcd is not entirely scale independent even thought the qcd coupling constant is dimensionless for example ive seen credible claim that bound dineutron state is stable at sufficiently higher quark masses than are measured experimentally also here even though bound dineutron states are not stable at physical masses presume that lattice qcd uses greater than physical masses because it is harder to do the calculations at the physical masses than at the heavier than physical masses but have trouble understanding why this should be so mathematically could someone please explain the reason that lattice qcd calculations are routinely done at greater than physical masses rather than at physical masses

322912 suppose we put jar in front of lamp which mimics sunlight and wait for the jar to heat up when the temperature of the jar increases by few degrees it stops increasing my thought is that as the jar absorbs heat it also gives heat off to surroundings when the heat absorbed equals the heat of surrounding area the temperature of jar no longer increases however am not quite sure of this explanation is it correct
323050 cannot understand how can the force carrier of electromagnetic force be the same particle that makes up light electrically charged objects emit photons by the way why dont we see them and the exchange of these photons make unlike charges attract like charges repel but then why cant one move charged objects by lighting them edit it seems many people dont misunderstand my question im not really asking why light cant move objects because it can via transferring momentum but not because photons mediated electromagnetic force between its emitter and receiver you can push objects with photons but it will accelerate very very slowly but you cant pull objects with photons is real life unlike in quantum mechanics now pick charged object and light it it wont move why wont these photons mediate force to the object or will it accelerate but at very slow rate that is far too small to be observable

323834 we know that reparametrization invariance of an action leads to hamiltonian which is identically zero check edmund bertschinger symmetry transformations the einstein hilbert action and gauge invariance for proof now note that the action of general relativity is reparametrization invariant therefore the hamiltonian must be zero we also know that according to the adm formalism the hamiltonian of general relativity is some expression possibly non zero this seems like an apparent paradox someone told me that this has to do with the fact that in the adm formalism foliation of spacetime is chosen therefore the two hamiltonians do not represent the same entity am not able to comprehend this line of reasoning please elucidate

325450 suppose we want to have formula which measures how hard we push or pull now momentum is measure of quantity of motion and our external push is something which changes it so our formula must have something to do with change in momentum now if we push box continuously with large effort then its momentum changes by large amount in short time interval and if we push the same box with feeble effort then to produce the same change in momentum we have to push it for longer time interval so the formula frac dp dt should make sense as measure of force but we can also think of the problem like this if we push box with large effort even through small distance then its momentum changes by large amount but if we push the same box with feeble effort continuously then weve to push it through larger distance to produce the same change in momentum so frac dp ds can also be measure of how hard we push or pull then what are the advantages of choosing frac dp dt as force
325535 this is question thats been bothering me while dont even know if it makes sense or not like if it is physics question or becoming philosophical one but here it goes the crux of my question basically is that we all know that we cant see light like in its photon or electromagnetic wave form directly when it is traveling past us however we also know that the way we see objects is by light reflecting off them this then means that we are seeing the light reflecting from the object which then sends the signal to our brain saying that we are seeing particular object we know that both light traveling past us and light reflected from objects are made of photons so they are the same kind so then my question is that what is happening to the photon of light after it is reflected from the objects that causes us to see it or the object but on the other hand we cant see light as it is directly traveling past us

326114 study maths in uni and we have course about relativity in the main principles ive read that the speed of light is invariant since we can calculate it from the maxwell equations my problem is that the maxwell equations know are not relativistic what is the clear way to formulate the maxwell equations with respect to the relativistic spacetime using that formulation do we get the same value for how do we do that edit it is clear now what was my problem after the answers the wrong concept had was that from the classical maxwell equations we can calculate the speed of light and with that information we can build up the relativistic spacetime where the maxwell equations might look different and it was weird for me from the answers it became clear that the invariant speed of light is an observation not result ps find it interesting that my maths like approach did not consider the possibility of something just being an observation not result
326529 this was question my friend found in book block attached to spring pulled by constant horizontal force is kept on smooth horizontal surface initially the spring is in its natural state then the maximum work that the applied force can do is 2f 4f 2k my friend thought that the answer is since the maximum displacement is and fx but he saw that the books answer is different and he asked this question to me at first thought that the answer will be but then realised that this situation is somewhat similar to charging capacitor the final energy of the spring is actually frac12kx 2k so probably the answer is but the work done is still but the book says neither its this is the logic in the book method in the book fx frac12kx 2f frac12kx 2f since the book is an objective questions book it did not have detailed explanations what is wrong in the following methods method by calculating the maximum displacement fx method by calculating the final energy frac12kx 2k ps we both know calculus so dont hesitate to use it in the answers
326797 why is the work done on charge calculated from infinity to point why not from one particular point to other
326967 have oft noticed that non rigid body on being rotated tries to increase its moment of inertia is there any way we can prove this in logical and mathematical fashion
327076 for example has anyone has directly observed charges oscillating due to standing em waves am particularly interested because itd demonstrate that radiation has transverse electric component to it anything else historical or modern that shows that light has transverse electric component would also be gladly invited
327186 it is said that the constant interaction between the molecules of gas in the form of collisions acts as randomising influence and prevents the gas molecules from settling but given the force of gravity wont the gas molecules settle at some point of time
327303 suppose we want to obtain displacement vector defined as mathbf st xt mathbf yt mathbf zt mathbf from the components of velocity vector mathbf vt dot xt mathbf dot yt mathbf dot zt mathbf mathbf according to my notes this can be done by equating each scalar component of the displacement vector to the indefinite integral of the corresponding scalars of the velocity vector mathbf st begin pmatrix xt int dot dt yt int dot dt zt int dot dt end pmatrix but as int fx dx fx frac df dx fx this should be syntactically wrong because were implying that number is equal to an infinite set of numbers or am missing something moreover this also leads to weird equation when solving the integral for example by taking into consideration the component of mathbf we would have that xt int dot dt which is correct but it would also mean that the component of the velocity could be equal to any value belonging to mathbb because of that we substitute with the initial condition and we equate it to zero giving it specific value but to me this sounds like break of the definition of indefinite integrals as int dot dt would basically mean that an indefinite integral is one specific function know this may be very stupid question and maybe it has to do with the same shortcuts that make us not specify forall in mathbb when adding the constant in the solutions of an indefinite integral but this doubt is really challenging me and still dont understand whether im missing some point or it should actually be written xt in int dot dt thanks lot in advance
327706 am aware that light partially polarizes upon reflection off non metallic surface however why is it that this only occurs for non metallic surfaces
327960 was looking at this answer on why absorption lines and emission lines dont cancel out an experiment shining light on the material and looking at the reflected spectrum will see absorption lines at those frequencies because the relaxation of the excited electrons will emit back radiation all around randomly whereas the reflected spectrum is at specific angle however it is not totally convincing to me the photons that get emitted towards the center of the sun by the electrons in higher energy states that absorbed photon earlier would get absorbed again when they hit different electron and then re emitted and would eventually make it out so why dont absorption and emission lines cancel out in our sun
328494 am wondering when solving rigid body exercises how can express the relationship between linear and angular acceleration for general case what would be the linear acceleration in function of the angular one of mathrm rod that is rotating through fixed point mathrm away from its mass center and what about the case of yoyo edit know the basic relation alpha but am confused as to how to choose and my textbook is not helping
328523 the power required to overcome drag is relative to speed cubed when im driving km my car consumes litres 100km at km the consumption should be litres 100km litres 100km obviously its lot less maybe only double what is it dont understand here
329044 sorry if this is trivial question why does gravity act at the center of mass if we have solid shouldnt gravity act on all the points xyz in why then when we do problems we only only consider the weight force from the center of mass
329292 see this sort of statement in many materials for example this the smallest radiating unit is dipole an electromagnetic point source and this the simplest infinitesimal radiating element called hertzian dipole however none of them includes clear explanation why dipole which is consist of charges isnt single non uniformly moving charge enough
329318 according to this site the general form of the gravitational potential energy of mass is frac gmm tag where is the gravitation constant is the mass of the attracting body and is the distance between their centres however am learning astrophysics at the moment and in the derivation of the virial theorem came across this alternate definition of the gravitational potential energy omega omega int frac gm mathrm tag so my question is as follows if go ahead and integrate find that omega left frac gm 2r right frac gm 2r ne but unless im mistaken omega must be equal to why are equations and apparently inconsistent due to giving different results tried searching the internet for an explanation but all sites found give the same result like this one on page therefore could someone please explain to me why am finding that ne omega
329376 can the huygens principle be justified rigorously mathematically to what extent and what purpose is it still relevant today is it made obsolete by the maxwell equations if not do the maxwell equations justify it
329604 at very basic level fusion can occur when the electrostatic repulsion between nuclei is overcome and they approach close enough for the strong force to come into play thus the easiest reactions would occur in nuclei with the lowest electrical charge relative to their nucleon count so that being the case why is the cross section for fusion so much smaller than fusion the electric charge is the same but the nucleon count is instead of what am missing
329781 relativity theory takes this result for granted because its one of its assumptions is there some theory which starts with some even more basic assumptions and then predicts that the speed of light is constant for all observers
329831 remember an episode of mythbusters where they were busting myths to do with head on collision between two cars they said that instead of crashing two cars into each other at 50mph they would crash car into stationary object at 100mph because the energy involved in the crash would be the same later on they corrected themselves to say that the energy is not the same but cant figure out why this would be the case can someone explain if these two scenarios are the same or not and why
330008 have been reading about volts and about the water pressure analogy being inadequate to describe electricity since pressure makes water increase speed and thus would mean electrons would also have an increase in speed under larger potential so if an electron doesnt increase in speed or have greater kinetic energy under larger volt and it always carries the same charge and current is the number of electrons passing through point how is one amp under volt even different from amp under volts
330120 consider two electrons approaching each other at rather fast speeds maybe even coming close to colliding does gravity play any role in this event if so how much influence does it have do we need gravity in charged particles
330453 it is known that friction is given as friction mu where is the normal force and mu is coefficient of friction for car travelling down hill with constant velocity the component of the gravitational force which is parallel to the cars velocity must be equal and opposite to the frictional force whereby the frictional force opposes the motion of the car however when the car is going up the hill for constant velocity to be obtained the frictional force must be going up the hill in the same direction as the motion of the car and equal and opposite to the gravitational force which is antiparallel to the cars velocity thought friction always opposes motion how can car accelerate with the same force friction which also causes it to slow down if there is no friction car cannot accelerate
330505 if have hamiltonian given by dagger dagger where aa dagger can make sense of it by generalizing the notion of vacuum if not what sort of troubles would run into has there been any instance such hamiltonians have been considered
330554 im struggling to understand the concept of quantum entanglement ive distilled my understanding into an analogy and need your help to validate it here it is lets say receive two envelopes both envelopes have this written on them hello open this letter if the paper inside is red then other envelope has blue paper if the paper inside is blue then other envelope has red paper so if open one letter and the paper inside is red then know the other letter contains the blue paper is this equivalent to quantum entanglement the fact that will know the color of the other paper when open observe one envelope in theory if one of the letters appeared in different galaxy would still know the color of the paper inside that letter just by opening my letter instantly correct before open the letter is the paper inside each envelope in superposition red or blue in this analogy am assuming that whats written on the letters is true is this correct assumption in quantum physics think so yes in real quantum physics would be able to change the color of one paper so that change the color of the other one no right
330994 light travels at speed through vacuum and then it encounters physical medium and slows down only to leave the physical medium and re enter vacuum the speed of light immediately re accelerates to speed the speed before going through the physical medium how does this happen what is the cause of this
331276 pardon if this is silly queston but im reading this for the first time it says that the force we perceive between two objects is an effect of the exchange of the force carrier particles even though gravitons are never detected thought of considering the idea that gravity works by exchanging gravitons suppose new particle is born from the decay of some heavy particle or from pure energy or teleported from another universe get that the particle and the earth dont feel gravity instantaneously they both need to exchange the force carrier particles assuming the graviton travels at light speed does it take some finite time before gravity is felt by the particle guess so but the question that is troubling me is how does the earth even know that new particle is born so that it needs to initiate sending graviton to the newly born particle
331699 our teacher told us that protons are nearly times heavier than electrons is there any known reason as to why this is so or is this just an empirical value one we do not know the reason to
331774 am reading this really interesting book by zwiebach called first course in string theory therein he generalizes the laws of electrodynamics to the cases where dimensions are not its an intriguing idea but the way he generalizes seems like an absolute guess with no sound basis in particular he generalizes the behavior of electric fields to the case of spatial and temporal dimensions by maintaining vec nabla vec rho but struggle to understand why could have maintained that vec falls off as the square of the inverse of the distance from the source essentially there is no way to differentiate between the coulombs law and the gausss law in the standard dimensions so how can prefer one over the other in the other cases to me it seems like it becomes purely matter of ones taste as to which mathematical form seems more generic or deep based on that one guesses which form would extend its validity in the cases with the number of dimensions different than that in which the experiments have been performed but on the other hand think there should be rather sensible reason behind treating the laws in the worlds with different number of dimensions this way considering how seriously physicists talk about these things so suppose should be missing something what is it
331976 was recently reading griffiths introduction to quantum mechanics and stuck upon following sentence but psi must go to zero as goes to pm infty otherwise the wave function would not be normalizable the author also added footer good mathematician can supply you with pathological counterexamples but they do not arise in physics can anybody give such counterexample
332395 leaf is green pen is blue and so on because those objects absorb all colours and reflect only one colour however when red light is incident on these objects their colour becomes reddish why is that the case
332461 in many texts the non relativistic newtonian kinetic energy formula text ke text newton frac mv is referred to as first order approximation of the relativistic kinetic energy text ke text relativistic gamma mc mc the same is also said of the classical momentum formula in relation to its relativistic counterpart however comparing the newtonian approximations to their respective relativistic formulas the newtonian ke formula appears to be second order approximation while the momentum formula appears to be of first order lets begin with momentum the relativistic formula for momentum is gamma mv frac mv sqrt left frac right for non relativistic velocities ll we use the taylor series frac sqrt approx left1 frac right giving approx mv left frac left frac right right approx which is first order in in other words approx mv which is the usual newtonian expression on the other hand the relativistic kinetic energy is begin align text ke text relativisitic gamma mc mc frac mc sqrt left frac right mc end align which for ll is text ke text relativistic approx mc left frac left frac right right mc mc frac left frac right frac which is obviously second order in if we compare plots of the newtonian forms for kinetic energy and linear momentum against their respective relativistic formulas there appears to be closer agreement for the approximation of kinetic energy than can be seen for linear momentum and hence my question why is the newtonian formula for kinetic energy referred to as first order approximation when it appears to be of second order
333025 recently was eating yellow rice for lunch in restaurant with only yellow lights but the rice looked white was intrigued by this because always thought it should look yellow since the yellow pigment reflects only yellow light but the rice looked really really white why is that thought it could be something about the rice but any yellow object was looking white the room was full of yellow light bulbs not normal yellowish bulbs but very tinted yellow lights and there was no other color of light to interfere maybe theres something to do with human perception
333262 was reading about bi metallic strips and came to know that on heating it forms an arc like shape also read sentence that said the radius of such an arc can also be calculated which will be taught in the future grades so just wanted to know if there is any direct formula to find the radius of curvature also think it can be found out using where is the angle subtended but then again how can the angle be found so what is the formula for radius
333619 fairly straightforward just thought it wouldnt be too hard to produce ripple in spacetime several times smaller than proton radius in particle accelerator or something it seems like it should be going on all the time
333996 see this statement in many qft books altland simons condensed matter field theory but the author never explains why can you briefly explain why grassmann fields never have classical meaning preferably physical arguments and possibly point out some good references
334004 in questions like this one temperatures of millions of degrees celsius kelvin it doesnt really matter at that point are mentioned but what does it mean exactly what is measured and how as more or less expected the wikipedia article mentions that the official definition the one was told in elementary school either between freezing and boiling points of water for celsius or between absolute zero and triple point of water for kelvin doesnt really work above 1300k so questions for earthly temperatures how is temperature measured consistently why would linearity of the measuring device be assumed in particular to extrapolate beyond the initial or range what guarantees that two thermometers working under different principles say mercury and electricity that agree at 0c and 100c will agree at 50c what do statements like the temperature in the suns core is times10 7k mean or even what do the 7000k in the earths core mean
334145 recognize that snells law relates indices of refraction and the angles of incidence and refraction but why does the equation use sine to describe those angles and not simply angle values it would seem that angle values would make the most sense since it directly refers to the size of the angle entering or exiting mediums what is it about the sine function that makes it essential to the correctness of snells law

334509 suppose have steady flow and want to find the rate of change of pressure of bit of fluid this depends on the velocity of the fluid and the pressure gradient frac mathrm mathrm mathbf cdot nabla the equation is simply saying that the pressure changes because im moving to new place in the flow so take how quickly im moving there and multiply by how much the pressure is changing in that direction if want to find the acceleration of bit of fluid conceptually its the same thing multiply the velocity by the velocity gradient in the direction of motion so one could write mathbf mathbf cdot nabla mathbf or leave out parentheses entirely however more commonly see mathbf mathbf cdot nabla mathbf in tensor notation its the same thing but it parses differently nabla has some intuitive physical meaning to me tensor for the gradient of the velocity field whereas cdot nabla doesnt seem to parse into anything particularly meaningful on its own this cdot nabla notation avoids having to figure out what the gradient of vector field is is that why its written that way or is there some other reason such as that theres good intuition for cdot nabla other than the rate of change due to spatial variation operator or am overthinking trivial bit of notation or what example of cdot nablav notation https en wikipedia org wiki navier e2 93stokes equations incompressible flow example of cdot nabla notation https en wikipedia org wiki material derivative
334926 assume there are no other forces acting and the rocket fuel described do not weigh anything also by rocket mean engine thruster not space shuttle suppose you have planet say of mass kg and you push it with rocket which exerts force of this will accelerate the planet by then suppose you have feather of mass kg and push it with the same rocket which exerts force of accelerating it by it follows that the feather will traverse distance of much faster than the planet and thus spend much less rocket fuel to do so so the energy used to propel the planet must be much more than the energy used to propel the feather but work done force distance times for both the planet and the feather think have misunderstood something how is this possible
335091 was reading recently how the compatibility of quantum mechanics with special relativity was initially problem for physicists and then dirac succeeded in formulating relativistic quantum mechanical theory through the dirac equation from my understanding the whole idea of relativity is to keep the speed of light or photons the same in all frames but in in quantum mechanics particles dont have definite position except when measured let alone velocity which is its derivative so how is speed of photon even defined quantum mechanically how do we generalize relativistic definitions like speed to be compatible with quantum mechanical concepts how exactly did dirac incorporate sr into his wave equation read related wikipedia articles but couldnt understand much am somewhat familiar with elementary concepts like the lorentz transform proper time the schrodinger equation etc but as you might tell have no formal education in it so please be easy with the technicality while answering
335184 appreciate the statement of heisenbergs uncertainty principle however am bit confused as to how exactly it applies to the quantum mechanical situation of an infinite square well understand how to apply schrodingers equation and appreciate that energy eigenvalues can be deduced as frac hbar pi 2ml however have read somewhere that the reason that the quantum particle can not have in other words is because by having zero energy we also have definite momentum with no uncertainty and by the heisenberg uncertainty principle this should lead to an infinite uncertainty in the position of the particle however this cannot be in an infinite well as we know it should be somewhere in the box by definition therefore may be another greater or equal to one surely when we have the energy as hbar pi 2ml which is also known energy and so why does this as well as the other integer values of not violate the uncertainty principle
335258 suppose the earth wasnt surrounded by magnetic field how would the aurora look like would we see sky full of colored star like lights with the color dependent on the energies of the incident particles the kind of particles with which particles the incident particles interact with and the altitude at which the interactions take place

336133 we can write down the metric of the schwarzschild black hole in schwarzschild coordinates on page of the notes by leonard susskind of course given at the perimeter institute titled black holes and holography we find the following however note that the schwarzschild coordinates are only formally valid for and must be analytically continued within the event horizon which aspect of the metric in schwarzschild coordinates indicates that the coordinates are only valid outside the event horizon
336206 it is well known that perturbation theory in quantum field theory leads to series that is at best asymptotic dysons famous argument for quantum electrodynamics is good justification for this what about in non relativistic quantum mechanics are there examples where time independent say perturbation theory leads to convergent series divergent series an asymptotic series as an example say one were to study the anharmonic oscillator with some perturbation mu perturbation theory for the ground state energy would lead to power series in mu dont think dyson applies here as the sign of mu for sufficiently small mu should not lead to such dramatic change in the physics as in negating the electric charge are there examples were perturbative series such as this diverge converge are asymptotic thanks for any input
336548 when atoms get heated up they start emitting em radiation because of accelerating electrons but why dont the protons emit em waves which destructively interfere with other emitted em waves because theyre also accelerating just as the electrons do because theyre both jiggling as one atom
336644 suppose we have cylindrical wire of radius carrying current if the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the wire the magnetic field inside is zero we can prove that easily using amperes law however when try to picture it in my head cant see why imagine that the cylinder is made up of infinite straight wires each of them contributing to the total magnetic field by frac 0i pi if we had two straight wires its obvious that exactly between them the fields are cancelled out with that in mind its easy to see that in the middle of the cylinder every component is cancelled by its symmetrical one what about the rest points it seems that one side is more powerful
336709 there is probably some reason for this but cant figure out what it is agree that it probably doesnt happen of the time but most all of the time the cream is clinging to just one of the cookie sides
336802 the phase difference can be measured but is it possible to measure the instantaneous phase of the electric field in light wave at one position
337423 im confused as to how quantum fields are defined mathematically and ive seen from questions on this site and wikipedia articles that classical fields are just functions that output field value for given point in space input is this the same for quantum fields are quantum fields too just functions if so how do they account for laws of quantum mechanics ive also seen answers on here saying things about operator valued distributions etc are these operators the creation and annihilation operators of the second quantization also if the field is field of operators then how do we determine the value of the field at point have all these snippets of knowledge and im not sure how they fit together to mathematically describe quantum fields finally im confused as to how it works with the rest of qft and guess this is my main question if quantum field is just field of creation and annihilation operators or even some other operators how do we define particles and their interactions you always hear that particles are just excitations in their quantum fields but mathematically how does this work and fit in with the other bits ive mentioned
337898 there is difference between the classical field phix which appears in the classical action phi and the quantity phi defined as phi cx equiv langle hat phi rangle which appears in the effective action even though phi cx is referred to as the classical field dont see why phix and phi should be the same in what sense therefore is the effective action gamma phi quantum corrected classical action phi how can we compare the functionals of two different objects namely phix and phi cx and claim that gamma phi is correction over phi apologize for any lack of clarity in the question and the confusion im hoping to clear up
337945 light is bent near mass for example when passing close to the sun as demonstrated in the famous sun eclipse of interpret this as an effect of gravity on the light however it seems to me at least that light is not accelerated when it travels directly toward the bary center of the sun the same gravitational force applies yet the speed of light remains constant viz what am missing
338089 know baryon is only stable when it contains quark of each color and as far as know the gluon essentially changes the color of quark and moves onto the next and this is what holds the particles together but in the process of the gluon moving from one quark to the next wouldnt the baryon have two quarks of the same color making it unstable or does the gluon move instantaneously or is the baryon not unstable enough to decay before the gluon reaches the next quark or essentially how does this process actually work
338456 as an extreme example suppose black hole bh were moving with respect to us would we not only feel gravitational pull to where the bh is directly located now but also where it was in the past and where its going in the future essentially does gravitational attraction also occur through the time dimension

338917 since an antiparticle by definition is particle with the same mass but opposite charge how is there such thing as an antineutrino neutrino has charge so could not have an opposite so why does an antineutrino exist and how does it differ from neutrino
339150 am following carroll he states that the geodesic equation is the the generalization to curved spacetime vec vec for vec vec this leads me to wonder what is the correct to generalize this further to paths that are not geodesics cases where vec neq suppose for example that an observer is sitting at on the surface of neutron star in schwarzschild geometry imagine that this observer does not follow geodesic since he is not falling toward smaller values of like test particles would and there is something present which the observer would interpret as force vec vec neq what would be the acceleration such an observer feels in particular this means that do not want to arrive at newtons law of gravitation what generalization of the geodesic equation is appropriate in situations like this and how would it be applied in any possible answer would prefer if point and would be addressed separately if possible
339489 was reading some popular science book and there was this sentence it says that energy has to be emitted in discrete portions called quanta otherwise the whole energy in the universe would be converted into high frequency waves im not physicist so this conclusion seems to me like huge leap first we assume that energy is emitted in continuous way not in quanta and how do we get to the statement the whole energy in the universe would be converted into high frequency waves
339504 context from what understand about the cosmic microwave background radiation is that it was from the big bang and since space has streched and become bigger since then the wavelength of the cmbr has increased over time which means that when the universe stopped being opaque it wasnt microwaves but gamma rays that must mean that it went from gamma rays to rays to ultra violet to visibile light blue then all the way to red then infra red and now microwave the cmb was emitted at an energy of em text ev which is the binding energy of hydrogen this corresponds to wavelength of lambda em frac hc em approx times text question so the question is simply if the cmb was emitted at the ionization energy of hydrogen why is it blackbody spectrum instead of line spectrum
339559 dark energy appears to be increasing at the rate which the universe expands why does this show the universe is open
339621 doubt has arisen regarding the following question are maxwells equations necessary to prove the postulates of special relativity what mean to say is einstein assumed two postulates namely all inertial frames are equivalent the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames does the requirement of come from maxwells equations or can it be argued without referring to them if the former then how can we prove it since maxwells equations do not put velocity bound if the latter how ask this question because even if its an assumption that works pretty well we just cannot take it because its got no logical footing why only photon why not anything else people generally answer by referring to massless particles bt the concept of massless particles itself comes from special relativity so all we have done is trace back circle
339645 suppose ph of water is think this means there is one text ion for every water molecules when we plug in the battery believe we see current as the text ions drift to the ve side of the battery and suck the electrons injected by the negative plate of the battery similarly text oh ions drift to the ve plate of the battery and give an electron away to the positive plate of the battery this way text and text oh ions neutralize themselves as they contribute to the current since the ions were neutralizing themselves would the current cease to exist after some time when all the text ions in the water were used up
339675 understand that killing vector mu satisfies mu nu also know that along geodesic the quantity mu mu is conserved where mu is the photon momentum or more generally tangent vector want to understand why it should be that this quantity is conserved want to show that frac lambda mu mu but cannot see how to even start given our knowledge of the property of the killing vector
339826 this is something thats puzzled me for while say you have proton with quarks uud with the quarks having charge and the quark doesnt this make quite neat fit for keeping the quarks confined within the proton in terms of the electrostatic forces between the three quarks at what point and for what reason did it become necessary to invoke gluons to provide the extra colour charge for ensuring quark confinement why is the ordinary electrostatic force not enough
340131 so mass can be created from energy when small protons speed up times bigger to be exact dont know if this is stupid question but im in middle school so cut me some slack where does all that mass go is it converted to thermal energy say we covered the earth with solar panels that would produce lot of energy also producing lot of mass dont know if thats the right wording dont want to sound like dont know energy cant be created or destroyed but if anyone could answer these questions for me thatd be great
340170 im currently reading about orbits of near earth satellites and some terminology is getting thrown around that im not sure understand what they actually mean the earths monopole moment and the earths quadrupole moment what are some easily understood explanations of the above terms
340285 ive been told that electrons can have over or over spin and that because of the pauli exclusion principle this is how they can occupy the same shell but when look online only ever see that particles with mass have only positive spin of over especially when look at the table of elementary particles so thought that maybe that particles always have spin of over and its just the direction of spin that makes it or because its handy way to explain it is that the case can all particles have the ability to have negative spin
340357 if you had big collection of neutrons they could decay into protons electrons and neutrinos through beta decay since protons are the only stable baryons after while you should get hydrogen out of that assuming some process to account for baryogenisis this would mean that the universe could start with whole bunch of neutral baryons and generate electrons as needed without having to worry about pair production to get its leptons with this in mind is there any evidence that hadrons were created first and then in turn created leptons regardless of evidence for baryogenisis itself or does the current theory suggest that leptons and hadrons were created contemporaneously in the very early universe
340479 already saw this phys se post and it seems perfectly reasonable that the free energy describing system must be non analytic function in order to display phase transition an analytic function can be taylor expanded around the critical point in phase transition the derivatives of the free energy are discontinous so the function cant be taylor expanded hence free energy must be non analytic my question arises because in the landau theory of phase transitions he considers that every free energy must be indeed analytic so why landau states such thing also in the paramagnet ferromagnet phase transition the discontinuous function is the magnetization which is not derivative of fmt but it is said to be second order phase transition why
340659 caesium is stable caesium and caesium are radioactive isotopes of caesium with half lives of years and years respectively why does caesium have longer half life if it contains three more neutrons than caesium and four more neutrons than stable caesium it would seem to me that caesium would have the longer half life given that it only contains one more neutron than stable caesium
340860 so learned that can create reciprocal lattice from direct lattice using the following formulas frac pi times times frac pi times times frac pi times times my question is why should consider when getting the formulas for 2d
341038 understand that light entering parallel block of glass at non degree angle will cause dispersion of colours within the block but that these will be refracted by the same degree upon exit so there will be no overall dispersion and will appear white but in that case why dont concave or convex lenses disperse additionally with block of parallel glass if it were sufficiently thick and wide although different frequencies would eventually catch up to each other and merge upon exit this would occur only after distance equal to the distance they were dispersed inside the glass right so the human eye if positioned close enough to the exit side of the glass would be able to see rainbow correct
341225 the cosmological principle states that the spatial distribution of matter and energy in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed in large enough scale find this notion problematic consider box with homogeneous and isotropic distribution of gas in rest when boost is introduced the gas is contracted lorentz fitzgerald contraction along the axis of movement and the distribution of gas in the box is clearly not isotropic anymore it is more dense along the axis of movement meaning there is preferred direction this suggests the cosmological principle is only true for the rest frame of the universe but this implies there is certain preferred frame relative to which an observer can always know how fast it is moving moreover this implies the friedman lema tre robertson walker metric that assumes the cosmological principle is only correct for the universal rest frame this goes against the invariance principle for inertial systems that lies at the very heart of relativity how can these problems be settled
341242 in quantum mechanics it is said that the galileo transformation mathbf mapsto mathbf mathbf quad text and quad mathbf mapsto mathbf mathbf tag is given by the operator mathbf exp left dfrac hbar mathbf cdot mathbf mathbf right tag now want to understand how does one show that this is the operator that implements the galileo transformation just cant understand because for me since we want mathbf mapsto mathbf mathbf it seems that the operator should just be translation by mathbf which would be mathbf exp left dfrac hbar mathbf cdot mathbf right but thats not it theres also the mathbf part which dont understand where it comes from ive tried two things first defining tilde psi mathbf psi mathbf mathbf tt to be the transformed wavefunction it also leads me to the translation only the second thing was to define mathbf dfrac hbar varepsilon mathbf with varepsilon infinitesimal and impose the conditions mathbf dagger mathbf tg mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf dagger mathbf tg mathbf mathbf mathbf in terms of the infinitesimal operator this becomes dfrac hbar mathbf varepsilon mathbf mathbf quad dfrac hbar mathbf varepsilon mathbf mathbf but this doesnt leads very far so what is the reasoning behind the usually presented being the operator that implements galileo transformations
341273 photons that are associated with the electromagnetic force are stable while the and bosons that are associated with the weak force are short lived guess that the high temperate electroweak particles that combine the electromagnetic force and the weak force are stable like the photons while the and bosons with short lives appear only when needed for decay is anybody here familiar enough with the research of the electroweak particles to know if they are stable or not
341400 if this question has already been asked or is super basic apologies im physics novice and this is my first question on this side of the site in classical physics waves and particles are mutually exclusive but in quantum theory subatomic particles are waves what if there were simultaneously waves and particles that we were testing but they were separate and distinct with our precision at the subatomic level not able to make that distinction when an ocean wave travels through water molecules most molecules move up and down while staying in place but few are carried by the wave for relatively short distance compared with the distance the wave travels what if subatomic particles were so light and the waves so strong that some particles could be carried tremendous distance then energy would radiate from star in huge waves carrying some photons for lightyears in distance but eventually dropping them which would put limit on the distance photon could travel in the single particle double slit experiment when firing solitary photon if the waves were still present in force it would make sense that individual photons would still demonstrate an interference pattern as for the effects of observation on these photons delayed choice quantum eraser experiment might their behavior not be explained by quantum entanglement sharing the interference of the sensors with the unobserved photon as stated im total amateur here so expect im just confused about something or ignorant of law or rule that would nullify this idea but as of now it makes more sense to me than thinking particles waves and observations in the future can effect behavior in the past please let me know what you think why im probably wrong and any links that would help me continue to educate myself on this would be much appreciated
341563 have question am struggling with for days so work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another at least as per wikipedia imagine scenarios scenario pen on which am applying force over course of 100m scenario an elephant on which am applying force over course of 100m imagine frictionless surfaces in both scenarios there would be of energy transfer as per work formula but what does it mean intuitively my doubt in scenario would be applying force for say time but in scenario would be applying same for time and obviously so am subjecting same force but for so different lengths of time why is transfer of energy defined as intuitively it seems more energy is expended in the elephants scenario since am applying same force but for more time can someone give me intuition which clarifies these scenarios
341809 do not have strong background in physics so please refrain from using complex mathematics in any answers was on this site and read when an electrical charge is moving or an electric current passes through wire circular magnetic field is created am trying to grasp the notion of magnetic fields under different reference frames suppose have point charge next to compass needle it is experimentally verifiable that the compass needle is not affected by the point charge the needle does not move it can be concluded that the point charge does not create any magnetic field but since the point charge is on the earth and the earth is moving shouldnt the point charge produce magnetic field why doesnt the compass needle move in response to this magnetic field is there magnetic field in the room

342072 the electromagnetic spectrum is continuous it can have any frequency since the ways of emission depend on velocity of electrons energy levels or vibrational modes of connections in molecules on the other hand the absorption of wavelengths depends only on vibrational mode of the absorbing material or energy levels of electrons in its atom if vibrational modes and energy levels are both discrete and the emission spectrum is continuous then doesnt it mean in practice that in principal there are unabsorbable frequencies or holes in the absorption spectrum
342105 was recently reading up about coulombs law and gauss law and several sources seemed to state that the gauss law was more fundamental than coulombs law even though one is deducible from the other which got me thinking what does it even mean for law theorem to be more fundamental
342328 my understanding of general relativity is that gravitation is equivalent to spacetime curvature and is proportional relative to localized mass traditionally we conceptualize that massive things attract each other by bending spacetime could some mechanism in the early universe have warped spacetime and thereafter massive objects attracted to or fell into these areas of warping thus giving us the difference between calculated galactic masses and observed activity in other words at this scale rather than mass bending spacetime perhaps warps in spacetime have collected mass has this been ruled out as the source of dark matter clarification edit thanks for the great explanations much of this knew its the maths im not so familiar with my initial question wasnt clear enough of course warped spacetime would affect normal matter as well which is why we see galaxies in those places wasnt meaning that dm normal matter and this warping exists but that the warping is what we call dm suppose that first there were some statistical outlying warpings of st geometry which collect normal matter which further the warping which collect more normal matter etc as feedback loop thus dm would be the difference between the warping from normal matter and normal flat spacetime curvature as opposed to some exotic form of matter that is warping spacetime

342686 saw question few days ago which referred to bertrands theorem so now know that stable closed orbits only occur when the potential function is frac or tfrac kr if we relax the conditions to stable but not necessarily closed orbits then what are the possibilities if we restrict consideration to power law forces kr for what are stable orbits possible my memory was that for geq there are stable orbits but for leq there are not forget the cases between and believe that circular orbit is possible for all but consider slight perturbation to that orbit for the well known case we will get ellipse with low eccentricity if my memory is right then for the orbit will be stable just not closed for the orbit will not be stable and spiral in or out after the perturbation am right on the power law forces have tried searching here and elsewhere but failed to find my answer clarification note that am not interested only in circular orbits the primary question is whether they are stable if perturbed but further information on the nature of stable orbits for central forces would be very welcome
342862 when cosmic rays pass through space they slow down but why the energy of the photons that hit these particles couldnt just be transferred to it making it go even faster in other words why cosmic rays lose energy thus speed when photons from the cmb collides with it would appreciate the help ps im not physicist nor expert just beginner who likes astrophysics so if said something stupid please correct me

343474 the name of the particle resonance in the recent announcement observation of the doubly charmed baryon xi cc is complicated im sure its standard notation but dont know how to decode it is it possible to explain the xi and the two super scripts and subscripts short description would be fine im wondering if the two plus signs indicate double charge or isospin or something else but im guessing that the double cs are related to doubly charmed in the title
343515 here is very simple example the definition of an electric field is vec frac text force text charge frac vec and its dimensions are mathrm newtons per coulomb but newtons per coulomb has the same dimensionality as mathrm volts per metre if we are just considering the magnitude of the quantity vec is it valid to write fbox vec frac text voltage text length of conductor frac ell tag since the dimensions are the same edit have now had chance to read all of your answers and comments and acknowledge that the general answer to this question in the title is no thank you to all that responded really appreciate your time the answers are wonderful however many of you have said that it is also invalid to write equation as did at the start in one of the answers user121330 mentioned that you should provide the actual example if you want more clarity also mentioned in comment below this question that would upload the example spoke of so here it is this is page from physics for ocr by authors david sang and gurinder chadha first published in by cambridge university press and has isbn more information about the book can be found on their website www cambridge org more importantly is that equation is also being used to derive ohms law this was small extract taken from my lecturers notes so does it seem that electric field cannot be written as frac ell or in magnitude as frac ell and both the book and my lecturer are wrong
343652 the book of dyson quantum field theory states in section that one can derive canonical commutation relations from schwingers quantum action principle however doesnt give calculation for the canonical momenta which should commute is it possible to derive the canonical commutation relations for fields and momenta just from schwingers principle edit by canonical commutation relations mean phix piy hbar deltax phix phiy pix piy with by schwingers principle mean that for given lagrangian which is an operatorvalued function on phix and partial mu phix variation phix phix delta phix phixm and the resulting change in the eigenstates new rangle old rangle the change in the transition amplitude langle new new rangle langle old old int dx phix int dx phix equals the change in the action
344681 im studying gr on carrolls book in chapter the constant appearing in einsteins equation is fixed by requiring to obtain poissons equation in newtonian framework in chapter the constant of the schwarzschild metric is fixed invoking the weak field metric understand that einsteins equation is built not derived or proved and hence we somehow do not have real ground to build on but we have to work the other way round still one would expect gr to be self contained so what is going on here is it actually necessary to use newtonian results

344747 there is the following problem in textbook on thermodynamics heat pump is an electrical device that heats building by pumping heat in from the cold outside in other words it the same as refrigerator but its purpose is to warm the hot reservoir rather than to cool the cold reservoir even though it does both have hard time understanding the principal difference between heat pump and refrigerator in refrigerator heat is drawn from cold substance into the refrigerator cabin and then excess heat is pumped out of the device now in the case of heat pump heat is also pumped from cold substance the cold outside and it goes into the cabin the building interior but then how does the building get heated and not refrigerated im really confused by this problem statement it couldnt be less clear
344909 was wondering how we could apply the laws of thermodynamics to defrosting some chicken breasts noticed that when put bag of frozen chicken breasts in lukewarm water the defrosting process is sped when compared with leaving on the counter or in the fridge this makes sense due to the higher temperature does the temperature of the chicken breast tend to the temperature of the water and in turn what does the temperature of the water tend to in summary how would you use the laws of thermodynamics to determine the most efficient way to defrost chicken breast update thanks to the answer and comments from johnrennie below im updating the question to be slightly more specific the situation is slightly different now just so can clear the situation in my mind and get better grasp on the concept of temperature equilibrium have the following set up have two sinks filled with water one is filled with lukewarm lw water and the other with cold cw water each sink with their own frozen chicken breast can we use thermodynamics to decide which chicken breast would tend to room temperature the quickest the reason for the change in question is that correct me if im wrong that the two sink systems will eventually tend to temperature of the kitchen system but how do we figure out which one gets there first
344918 it is often claimed that spin is purely quantum property with no classical analogue however as was very recently pointed out to me there is classical analogue to spin whose action is given in stone supersymmetry and the quantum mechanics of spin nucl phys by left int gamma vec cdot vec mathrm int omega vec cdot left frac partial vec partial wedge frac partial vec partial tau mathrm mathrm tau right right where omega is region on the unit sphere bounded by the closed loop gamma stone goes on to derive the algebra satisfied by the quantities equiv as the standard angular momentum algebra given by ij pb epsilon ijk where cdot cdot pb denotes the poisson bracket however while this all makes good deal of sense and the connection to spin in quantum theories is evident through path integration over su2 have to wonder why isnt this action studied in most introductions to classical mechanics some authors claim its because the dynamics generated by this action can only be understood through the use of symplectic forms which is rather advanced formulation of classical mechanics but this answer isnt very satisfying to me instead have the following set of related questions are there even any classical systems which can be described by such an action alternatively since the above action has degrees of freedom defined on the surface of the unit sphere are there classical systems whose dynamical degrees of freedom are simply on if so what are they and do they have direct quantum analogues in the same way that say the harmonic oscillator exists in both classical and quantum mechanics and the classical and quantum hamiltonians are directly related to one another if not why does spin appear as dynamical variable in quantum mechanics but not in classical mechanics despite the fact that both theories can accommodate it if classical mechanics is simply limiting case of quantum mechanics what about this limiting process causes spin to disappear in classical systems
345022 am tasked with this seemingly innocuous looking question consider the electric field of an arbitrary plane electromagnetic wave vec vec exp left left vec cdot vec omega right right write out the three components of vec so give my answer as 0x exp left leftk cdot omega right right 0y exp left leftk cdot omega right right 0z exp left leftk cdot omega right right such that vec hat hat hat where hat hat hat are the set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors but was suprised to learn that the actual answer is 0x exp left leftk cdot cdot cdot omega right right 0y exp left leftk cdot cdot cdot omega right right 0z exp left leftk cdot cdot cdot omega right right firstly this question seems little subjective as the question specifically asks about the electric field reason for boldface but then uses vec to denote the electromagnetic wave so basically would need to know if vec is representing the electric field or electromagnetic wave unfortunately there is no way can check this but supposing either is true if we are considering just the component of the electromagnetic electric wave field why do we need all three components xyz in the argument of the exponential mathematically understand why the answer is correct since the equation vec hat hat hat would not hold if the arguments of the exponentials were different but physically cannot understand why the answer that gave is wrong why cant each component of the wave field have single component in the exponential
345381 it was claimed that if an iceberg melts in the ocean the sea level wont change as the ice displaces as much water as there will be melted water the other claim was that the sea level should rise because oceans contains salt so the water in oceans is denser than the water in the ice which one is the correct reasoning
345404 after the article that china teleported particle into orbit im trying to understand the applications of quantum teleportation it sounds like nice oddity of the universe but has very little to no practical value id love to be corrected but from what understand the basic procedure is this alice and bob split up pool of entangled widgets alice and bob move far away from each other alice does black magic to her pile of widgets through blacker magic this affects bobs pile of widgets instantly this sounds all well and good until hit this part alice sends the new configuration of her pile of widgets to bob through traditional channels after bob gets the information from alice he knows what state his pile of widgets should be in this is great and all but since alice sends the new configuration of her pile of widgets to bob through traditional channels what is the point of even using the widgets it seems like weve added bunch more complexity for no real reason other than hey this is cool
345455 the kilogram is in the process of being redefined in terms of plancks constant so as to eliminate its dependence on physical artefact since the length and temperature units are already precisely defined why not just calculate the density of some substance say water at particular temperature and use that as standard for mass sounds simpler to me
345554 there are various more or less formal ways of expressing the foundational principles of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics including both nonmathmatical statements and more rigorous axiomatizations recently there have been various people who have treated this from quantum computing point of view others have explored whether qm can be bent without breaking it ive given some references at the bottom of this question to some of this kind of work but more concretely think most physicists would consider the following to be some sort of consensus on an informal list of principles actually id be happy to hear criticisms of this list as well wavefunction fundamentalism all knowable information about system is encoded in its wavefunction ignoring phase and normalization unitary evolution of the wavefunction the wavefunction evolves over time in deterministic and unitary manner observables any observable is represented by hermitian operator inner product there is bilinear positive definite inner product on wavefunctions completeness for any system of interest there exists set of compatible observables such that any state of the system can be expressed as sum of eigenstates question does this summary of principles have to be modified for qft if so how if not then what is the core difference between these two theories references kapustin https arxiv org abs mackey the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics 56ff aaronson is quantum mechanics an island in theoryspace http arxiv org abs quant ph masanes and mueller derivation of quantum theory from physical requirements https arxiv org abs hardy quantum theory from five reasonable axioms https arxiv org abs quant ph dakic and brukner quantum theory and beyond is entanglement special https arxiv org abs banks susskind and peskin difficulties for the evolution of pure states into mixed states nuclear physics volume issue september pages nikolic violation of unitarity by hawking radiation does not violate energy momentum conservation https arxiv org abs unruh and wald https arxiv org abs hep th ellis et al search for violation of quantum mechanics nucl phys b2411984381 gisin weinbergs non linear quantum mechanics and supraluminal communications http dx doi org physics letters sebens and carroll self locating uncertainty and the origin of probability in everettian quantum mechanics https arxiv org abs

345861 ive found number of questions that concern the doppler effect but none that seem to address my question have background in music people with musical ear can generally tell the ratio between two frequencies as musical interval for anyone whos not already aware we perceive ratio of as an octave as perfect fifth as perfect fourth as major third and as minor third therefore if vehicle passes at speed and perceive that the frequency of the engine noise drops by fourth as it does so then know that the ratio of the frequencies approaching departing is is this information just the ratio of the frequencies enough coupled with an assumed speed of sound of around 330m to calculate the speed at which the vehicle passed well assume the car passed quite close by so can be considered to be coming almost directly towards me when approaching and almost directly away when departing at this point we dont know the actual frequency of the sound just the relative frequencies some people alack not myself are fortunate enough to have perfect pitch in which case they could even estimate the exact frequencies lets assume 220hz and 165hz is this extra information helpful needed to ascertain the speed of the passing vehicle im not interested in telling the difference between and 38mph more like by the sound of it that must have been going at least 80mph
346253 have read about generalization of maxwell equation on manifolds that employs differential forms and hodge duality that goes as follow df qquad text and qquad star tag as understand exterior derivative is defined to be the differential on forms and to be an antiderivation roughly speaking the hodge dual of form is defined as the unique form star that satisfy eta wedge star langle eta rangle mathrm vol for all forms eta we can express the faraday tensor in coordinates such that the metric tensor is trivialized at one point mu nu eta mu nu then one should compute the hodge dual using the general formula in basis begin equation star alpha frac kn epsilon dotsi sqrt detg alpha dotsj 1j cdots kj wedge cdots wedge end equation that formula can be used to obtain star in single point if one put mu nu eta mu nu but due to the vanishing of first derivative of the metric tensor once differentiate with the exterior derivative one gets the correct expression in the point where the metric was trivialized by decomposing the effect of the derivative as spatial and temporal parts one gets maxwell equation here im following john baez and javier muniain gauge fields knots and gravity thus one sees that in an local inertial coordinate reference usual maxwell equation are obtained this formulation uses the fact that there is lorenzian metric and that the manifold is orientable but doesnt rely on any addiction structure like connection however am aware of another way to generalize maxwell equation the minimal coupling which is the substitution of usual partial derivative with the covariant derivative leading to nabla ab qquad text and qquad nabla bc tag with the levi civita connection dont understand how this two are connected are those two generalization the same how can it be possible if the differential form formulation is not aware of levi civita connection it will be remarkable if the right connection popped out from the differential forms version of the maxwell equation
346407 have just experienced snowfall and am not so clear on how it works three days after short day of snowfall and having min max degrees celsius full sunny scarcely cloudy each day there is still some snow persisting in shadow and dark places this is contrary to my intuition wouldve expected all the snow to have melted and disappeared after the first sunny day or after the second yet we are on the third day and still some snowman heads are alive is it because the snow contains salt or does the snow create low temperature air around itself or does the daily morning humidity turn the snow into ice blocks that are harder to melt and more solid to scatter sun rays

348222 hamiltonian mechanics is geometry in phase spase the poisson bracket arises naturally in hamiltonian mechanics and since this theory has an elegant geometric interpretation im interested in knowing the geometrical interpretation of the poisson bracket ive read somewhere that the poisson bracket of two functions and of the dynamical variables ip it given by fg sum left frac partial partial frac partial partial frac partial partial frac partial partial right is the dot product in phase space of the ordinary gradient of and the symplectic gradient of let me illustrate this interpretation as know the gradient in phase space is partial partial and the symplectic gradient is partial partial is just the gradient rotated by circ clockwise think the dot product is apparent now questions what is the meaning significance of the dot product interpretation is there any other geometrical interpretation of the poisson bracket
348232 have been told to think of vectors as existing independent of coordinate system this means that the magnitude of vector should be independent of any coordinate system we choose galilean transformations of the form vt do not preserve the magnitude of the velocity vectors however how is it possible to have vector that has different magnitude in different coordinate system
348271 not being physicist but liking to keep up with the news read that new particles were discovered that are their own anti particles can see that perhaps we can discover particle that has an anti particle as in the case of the electrons and when they come in contact we get all energy from the reaction believe they are called positrons being the anti particle to the electron but how can any particle be its own antiparticle if that was the case would they not annihilate each other and you would never even know they ever existed since as soon as one was in the process of being created and it is its own antiparticle it would go into non existence as fast as it came into existence and you would never know which particle it was that was its own antiparticle

348471 dont understand how the centripetal force which always points to the center of our circular motion can cause this scenario we have big stone which spins very fast so fast that part breaks down because of the centrifugal force this is at least how my text books describes it my problem the centrifugal force does not really exist we only use it in accelerated frames of reference so the newton laws still work there so if were in laboratory frame of reference which force would pull that piece of the stone to the outsode of the circle when we only have the centripetal force as mentioned pointing to the center of the circular motion please dont try to explain it in an accelerated frame of reference because there understand it but dont understand it in laboratory frame of reference

348756 suppose for the sake of this thought experiment am structurally identical to an average human with the only difference being that my body is scaled in all directions by factor of this would result in me having 27x more mass than normal human in cinema giants tend to move very sluggishly and that seems to match our expectation of creatures of that size after all most people think of whales and elephants as being very large slow moving creatures however now also have 27x more muscle mass wouldnt my much larger muscles provide the necessary force to counteract the increase in inertia barring slight increase in air resistance wouldnt my body movements walking running moving my arms be indistinguishable from that of normal sized human and not sluggish as depicted in movies
348892 the photon box is thought experiment involving massless perfectly reflective box containing light when the box is accelerated in any direction it results in difference of force being applied to the walls of the box that are in line with the acceleration the front being pushed less and the back being pushed more this results in resistance to acceleration or inertial mass and this mass can even be given value in kilograms regardless of the fact that no individual components are massive while understand that this box is massive do not know whether the box would have weight would the box fall in gravity field if so why
348950 when make martinis the recipe use is fluid ounces1 of gin2 and fluid ounce dry vermouth3 shaken or stirred4 with ice cubes5 then strained into cocktail glass mix until its cold enough and not for some specific length of time my observation if use less ice the martini is more diluted if use more ice the martini is stronger too strong in fact prefer some dilution my hypothesis with lot of ice the drink chills very fast not giving the ice as much time to melt and vice versa my friends think am crazy about the amount of ice6 they claim that the ice has to melt to chill the drink so no matter how much ice start with the same amount is melted to reach the desired temperature and had to retake physics 2a in college7 so what do know anyway pointed out that could chill the drink with really cold rocks whiskey stones and it could get just as cold with no melting and maybe they are missing something the answers to these questions seem to support my friends argument that the melting of the ice is the overwhelming contributor to the cooling what cools drink is an ice globe the worst possible way to cool drink with ice calculate mass of ice needed to cool water delta degrees however my experiment seems to demonstrate otherwise my experiment tested this by making six martinis two each with and ice cubes used the same amount of gin and vermouth in each weighed8 the ingredients before adding them to the mixing cup stirred until the desired temperature9 was achieved then weighed the amount after straining my result the cube martinis gained more weight than the cube martinis which in turned gained more weight than the cube martinis assume the weight gain was the melted ice my friends happily drank all the martinis but remained unconvinced of my physics acumen either theoretical or experimental10 my question am exhibiting confirmation bias and my stupid friends are right or is there an explanation for my hypothesis and observation and they should finally shut up about my having to retake physics 2a because come on it was like years ago already and besides im not using plancks constant to calculate how long it takes atoms to slow to halt im just making martinis is the ratio of nearly ice to liquid factor how about the constant mixing or is this dependent on the starting temperature of the ice and even though the warming of the ice contributes very little it is enough to affect the outcome footnotes apologies for the use of american measurements in this scholarly context but thats what my utensils are labeled with no apologies for the insistence on gin if you want to use vodka or make some other cocktail and call it martini we have nothing further to discuss use ratio others may quibble they are wrong seriously do not care can please continue for my ice trays this is fluid ounces of water prior to freezing in plain old kitchen freezer although they are all too happy to drink the martinis make these are friends that went to college with so cant argue that point but there were three intramural softball playoff games the weekend before finals so when was going to study but digress postal scale accurate to american again ounce sorry degrees american fahrenheit on my kitchen thermometer that measures to degree but accuracy unknown am willing to rerun that experiment as long as necessary until get it right edit appreciate the answers and am accepting the answer from cyberx86 because it independently supports my insistence that ice cubes is the right number and what kind of physics site would we have if we didnt reward showing your work however no one really put bow on it so ill add my conclusions since the final temperature of the martini drops below and there is also ice melting there must be both melting and absorption occurring together during the mixing the measurable change in the amount of melting in this case is due to the addition of the heat absorption capacity of more ice but only because it is below to start with
349014 we could imagine simple electronic circuit composed by power source and resistor it is usual find descriptions as the moving charged particles in an electric current are called charge carriers in metals one or more electrons from each atom are loosely bound to the atom and can move freely about within the metal these conduction electrons are the charge carriers in metal conductors wikipedia electric current that made me imagine electrons going from power running by the wires crossing the resistor and returning to power where they suffer new kick to power all that at near the speed of light in this model it is easy to define electrical current intensity as proportional to the number of electrons per second that cross one specific point of the circuit however looking for the physics of resistivity can read the phrase the actual drift velocity of electrons is very small in the order of magnitude of meter per hour wikipedia electrical resistivity and conductivity this is complete different point of view where electrons are more or less fixed around fixed position or moving very slowly an electricity is wave of collisions or jumps of electrons like in newtons cradle or do the wave as public in football match obviously we do not need severals hours from the switch on to the light on so the question is do electrons move around circuit references to band theory are welcome related question is if electrons doesnt moves along the circuit what is electrical current intensity note known there are similar questions already posted but answers of the ones ive read are not very detailed could be ive not found the best ones please be few patient before close vote
349032 in some submarines divers can exit and enter through moon pool an opening in the bottom of the submarine we can clearly see oceans water flowing in the moon pool but it wont come inside why so what is stopping the water here from coming inside
349115 ive read several popular articles telling that frequent opening of the fridge highly increases the power consumption is it really so significant isnt the heat in the room temperature food which is brought to the fridge so much more relevant that some air which goes into the fridge upon opening the door is nothing compared to that to make it more concrete how many times do have to open and close the fridge so the effect is comparable with putting there litre box of milk at the room temperature lets say the room has the fridge
349169 gravitational and electrostatic forces are everyday phenomenon and continue to be tested by sophisticated experiments at various distances rutherford measured the electrostatic repulsion of alpha particles from nuclei at higher incident energies when the projectile energy is sufficient to overcome electrostatic repulsion and distances of few fermi can be probed an attractive nuclear force shows up in the angular distribution as well but has the weak force ever been measured as force understand there is some subtleties here since in quantum mechanical systems like nuclear scattering for example we use potential form nuclear plus electrostatic and interpret the angular distribution by propagating an incident wave to get the angular distribution so wonder if deflection in scattering experiment due to the weak interaction would be good enough even if it might be difficult to interpret as strictly force related weak force attractive or repulsive can the weak force create bound state the charges of the forces
349403 have rather basic maybe even dumb question was wondering why speed is defined as it is of course what the equation means is not too difficult to understand however there are many ways that and could be related for instance am not sure who the first person to define speed was but was wondering how they made the decision to define speed as distance divided by time
349418 when is time degree of freedom was doing problem and made mistake and said that vec nabla cdot vec vec frac partial vec partial frac partial vec partial frac partial vec partial frac partial vec partial this discovered is wrong as the partial time derivative should be left out my question pertains to the reason for this when do we treat time as degree of freedom that should be included in the divergence or curl or gradient in the case of scalar function
349536 according to einsteins theory of relativity gravity is not pulling us down but space is pushing us down this mean there is no gravity and its an illusion so in this scenario how does earth hold its atmosphere since there is no force to pull it down
349672 the law of conservation of electric charge states that the net electric charge of an isolated system remains constant throughout any process in simple words charge can neither be created nor destroyed the question that popped into my head is that if take out some electrons from neutral body it would become positively charged so didnt just create some charge contradicting the law of conservation this feels kinda vacuous but what am missing here
349882 wasnt sure if this might be better suited to history of science and mathematics se but suppose it is bit more science than historical apparently newton believed in absolute space and absolute time existing independently from anything else within the universe these beliefs were supposedly laid down in the scholium of his principia see here however was under the impression that galilean relativity although supporting the idea of absolute time did away with absolute space and yet newton believed in galilean relativity and his first law body remaining in state of rest or uniform motion unless acted on by net force is essentially statement of galielean relativity how can it be so that newton believed in absolute space and believed in galilean relativity in fact in the link it suggests that newton believed in absolute motion as well which would be implied from his belief in the existence of absolute space and absolute time anyway perhaps am getting confused between the notions of relativity and absolute space time
349888 if you place cell with negligible internal resistance and an emf of 5v in parallel with resistors as shown below each resistor will have potential difference of 5v across it however if you were to replace the rightmost resistor with another cell this time with an emf of 6v and negligible internal resistance what will be the potential difference across the resistor remaining in the middle how would the potential difference be the same across each branch in this case would it even be the same and if not then how does this fit with kirchhoffs second law
350061 im reading book about single particle detection and particle detectors in general all detectors in the book rely on some energy transfer from the particle to the detector in form of ionisation activation photo effect etc im wondering if it is possible to detect incident particles of any form with detector without there being an energy transfer between particle and detector want to explicitly rule out processes in which the presence of particle is theoretically deducted from the measurement of another particle where energy transfer is allowed on side note it would be interesting to hear of concepts where the energy transfer is negative from detector to particle
350185 the only numerical tensors that are invariant under some relevant symmetry group the euclidean group in newtonian mechanics the poincare group in special relativity and the diffeomorphism group in general relativity are the metric mu nu the inverse metric mu nu the kronecker delta delta mu nu and the levi civita tensor sqrt det mu nu epsilon mu nu dots note that delta mu nu mu rho rho nu so only two of the first three invariant tensors are independent this result is extremely useful for constructing all possible scalar invariants of given set of tensor fields but ive never actually seen it proven how does one prove that there are no other invariant tensors
350404 according to quantum mechanics any quantum angular momentum is quantized in units of hbar does it mean that the angular momentum of the ceiling fan due to its rotation is quantized if yes what does it physically mean does it mean that it cannot rotate with arbitrary speed
350496 noticed people who wear glasses clean the lenses by first breathing on them and then wiping it with something like tissue or cloth etc does this actually help
350568 im quite surprised by these regularly spaced rings of alternating brightness in fluorescent tube these are also moving along the tube and only appear when the voltage is low what are these and does the pattern have anything to do with ac frequency
350805 is there logical mathematical way to derive what the very maximum percentage of surface area you can see from one angle of any physical object for instance if look at the broad side of piece of paper know have only seen of its surface area minus the surface area of the very thin sides is always the maximum amount of surface area you can see of any object from one angle assumptions this is assuming we arent considering transparent semi transparent objects or the extra parts we can see with the help of mirrors just looking at the very surface of an object from one particular angle
350938 mathematically understand why proper time tau is an invariant quantity since it is defined in terms of the spacetime metric tau sqrt ds using the signature and with more abstractly tau simply parametrises the length between two points along worldline and hence is obviously invariant in this sense however putting this aside for moment intuitively im less certain how to provide an answer to the question why it is the case that proper time is physically an invariant quantity consider particle in minkowski spacetime if two different observers alice and bob are moving at different velocities with respect to the particle and with respect to one another and each measures the elapsed time for the particle to propagate from one point to another then they will measure different time intervals to one another however they will both agree on the elapsed proper time of the particle is the reason why this is the case because the question what is the time experienced by the particle is frame independent question the proper time is measure of the amount of physical process that the particle undergoes as it moves along its worldline and this is physical coordinate independent phenomenon if alice and bob disagreed on the amount of elapsed proper time then they would be disagreeing with the particle on how much time has elapsed for the particle which would be nonsense apologies for such basic question im hoping someone can clear up any confusion for me
351108 if you add red light thz and green light thz you get what we perceive as yellow light thz but assume what you really get is mixed waveform that we perceive as yellow suppose the red is perfect sine wave and so is the green the mix of both will not be perfect sine wave but wobbly composite thing right which is different than perfect sine wave of thz but we call both things pure yellow is that correct if so are there animals that can discern composite pure yellow from singular pure yellow like we can discern the mixture of multiple audio sine waves as chord or is there machinery that can do that see also why both yellow and purple light could be made by mix of red green and blue
351309 usually in undergrad qm we see states such as psi rangle pm frac sqrt rangle pm rangle where trivially the state is symmetric and the state is antisymmetric however am bit confused by the particle exchange procedure ive mostly convinced myself it is swapping the contents within each ket rather than swapping the kets themselves reason this because there may be state phi rangle rangle which has to be symmetric but there are no other terms to swap it with although im not confident ask this question because im wondering about the symmetry of the state frac sqrt rangle rangle if in fact as think we flip the numbers within each ket then this state is symmetric however if we flip the kets themselves then this state is antisymmetric can someone provide insight into this with physical interpretation
351517 ive always assumed ac to be just another kind of current however ive recently heard this statement there is no real current in ac and we use the concept of current only to make understanding of ac easier is this statement true why or why not the only thing similar ive seen in physics is the concept of centrifugal force force which doesnt exist but we imagine to help with our understanding could this be something similar ive found nothing on wikipedia
351547 am reading these names hard particles and soft particles while reading literature related to jets but yet have not come across formal definition classifying them does it mean that the particles involved in hard interactions are hard and vice versa wished to the exact meaning of these definitions
351861 know that polarization only occurs in transverse waves and polarization of light occurs as em wave is transverse wave but sound waves are both transverse and longitudinal in solids so can polarization occur for the transverse part but we cannot stop the sound wave from propagating by any medium except vacuum because it will propagate through the stopping mediumlike an analyzer but for sound even if it gets polarized somehowi dont think it can get polarized then how can we observe it since any sound reaching our eardrums will be longitudinal as the medium in front of our eardrums will be air and so no polarization will occur in longitudinal waves see the 7th and 8th line in this imagesource https en wikipedia org wiki polarization waves am little confused now this may seem as possible duplicate but all other answers didnt clarify my doubt edit based on the answers it seems that shear waves can be polarized so my question is how to polarize these shear waves
351866 borns statistical interpretation of the wave function says that psi xt is the probability density of finding the particle at point at time then int infty infty psi xt dx tag in other words the particle must be somewhere in space at certain time is this equivalent to saying that the particle must be somewhere in time at certain position my thoughts why cant write int infty infty psi xt dt tag whenever look for the position of the particle psi stops obeying the schr dinger equation and discontinuously collapses to spike around some position if was able to focus my microscope at say and look for the particle across all of time in this case time is the measurement at not position so setting my microscope at doesnt disturb anything then psi would collapse to spike around some value of and this method of normalizing the wave function would be appropriate however humans can only sample at instants in time and look over all space equation textbf we cant sample at an instant in position and look over all time equation textbf scientists cant search for the particle in time therefore textbf is not appropriate however even though we cant do this as humans search through time at will instead of staying anchored to the present is it wrong to say that nature cant accomplish textbf or do we have laws like the 2nd law of thermodynamics that say nature is prohibited from doing so is this an example that shows how space and time are not on equal footing
351880 might be an odd question but recently read up on how sound works from wikipedia in physics sound is vibration that typically propagates as an audible wave of pressure through transmission medium such as air water or other materials which got me thinking on how fake reversed sound in an audio software must be imagine someone knocking on wooden door from what understand the sound you hear comes from the wooden door vibrating from the impact of the fist if you record it and reverse the sound in an audio software it cant be an accurate representation of how it would sound if it was reversed in real life it would have to somehow mimic the vibration of the wooden door and play that backwards which is obviously impossible so if im right how would such sound actually sound in real life if it was reversed
352602 in the context of maxwells equations was wondering whether there was any physical significance to the dual em field tensor and or its various derivations it has components tilde textbf begin bmatrix end bmatrix have seen two ways of deriving it one which uses index lowering via the minkowski metric tilde mu nu eta mu alpha alpha beta eta beta nu and another which uses the levi civitia tensor tilde mu nu frac epsilon mu nu alpha beta alpha beta am also aware it can be reached via the substitution to and to however it seems as though this is just consequence of the above definitions are both these definitions just formalisms so the dual em tensor has the form it does so it can be used in certain physical equations such as the simplification of maxwells equations partial mu tilde mu nu or is there any physical intuition to the ways in which it is defined
352659 while reading the introduction to feynmans lectures its mentioned how glass of water cools down through evaporation when some molecules get bit extra energy and break free if its not closed system energy will be gradually taken away from the cup hence blowing at the soup helps move those molecules away so that they dont reenter the surface but thought that all bodies also radiate heat does cup of water also emit low frequency radiation or is my understanding incorrect
352901 am self studying electrodynamics and am wanting to know what is meant by potential understand the concept of potential energy but what is meant by potential is it the same thing as field like gravitation or electromagnetic
352905 got the difference between polar vectors and axial vectors pseudovectors an example of pseudovector is mathbf but why exactly the magnetic field is pseudovector and its components parallel to an coordinate axis do no change signs if reverse that axis
352914 am not planning on staring into the sun during an eclipse or any other time have been reading about how no variety of regular sunglasses are safe enough to view the eclipse with im not talking about being able to see things clearly but just actual eye safety from what understand it is the ultraviolet light that causes damage to the retina but maybe it is more complicated how do my eyes get hurt if am looking at the sun through so called uv protection and what makes the eclipse glasses sold in stores different edit to clarify this is not about how the rays from the sun are dangerous but about why uv blocking sunglasses fail do other dangerous rays get through is the marketing essentially in what way are the best consumer sunglasses inadequate for looking at an eclipse answers about pupil dilation and what makes an eclipse more dangerous for naked eye viewers are not what im after
353080 if thousand people whisper inaudibly will the resulting sound be audible assuming they are whispering together believe the answer is yes because the amplitudes would simply add and thus reach an audible threshold is this right if possible please provide an explanation simple enough for non physics people
353081 imagine container filled with highly pressurized air now imagine that there is some object maybe marble inside the container is it possible to cause the marble to float within mid air due to the forces of the pressurized air acting on it in all directions additionally why is it that objects tend to spread to the edges of the container rather than the center imagine this would also depend on the shape size and pressure of the container as well as the shape and size of the objects inside
353244 ive been taught that in em waves the electric and magnetic field are in phase nevertheless using maxwell equation in absence of sources and solving the wave equation square in cylindrical coordinates and under clindrical symmetry frac partial partial phi frac partial partial one can get as solution the two fields with only one nonzero component and in the limit of frac omega has begin cases approx frac sqrt mathrm sin omega frac frac pi phi approx phi frac sqrt mathrm sin omega frac frac pi end cases the two fields are out of phase so is the in phase relation between the two fields really universal rule or is it valid only in some cases such as the simplest case of plane wave
353253 while was reading book on mechanics when introducing the vector multiplication the author stated that multiplying two vectors can produce vector scalar or some other quantity multiplying vectors multiplying one vector by another could produce vector scalar or some other quantity the choice is up to us it turns out that two types of vector multiplication are useful in physics an introduction to mechanics daniel kleppner and robert kolenkow the authors then examine the scalar or dot product and the vector or cross product the latter not shown in the above link can be seen on amazons preview but seem to make no mention of any other method my concern is not about vector multiplication here but what can be that quantity which is neither scalar nor vector the author has explicitly remarked the quantity as neither scalar nor vector what think is that when we define vectors and scalars we propose the definition in terms of direction in one direction is considered and in another it is not considered then how can this definition leave space for any other quantity being as none of the two would be obliged if someone could explain me if the statement is correct and how is it so also it would be great if you can substantiate your argument using examples
353624 lets say we have emitter emitting light that has frequency less than the threshold frequency of metal if you leave light shining onto that metal for long enough does the energy of the individual photons accumulate on the electrons so eventually they will ionize or does this not happen what am missing
353649 suppose polarised light has intensity when it is passed through polariser also known as polaroid whose transmission axis is at angle theta with vector the intensity becomes cos theta according to law of malus so the intensity and the amplitude decreases so where does this energy go
353667 since the velocity of rotational motion of earth equals orbital velocity of the satellite they are relatively at rest to each other if so the satellite should be at constant position above the earths surface how can it revolve if it moves with the earth
353742 on my book is written for particle in an infinite square well supposed 1d and large begin align delta sim to text heisenberg uncertainty principle to delta text min sim frac pi left frac 2m right to text min sim frac pi 2a 2m end align however im not sure that the last passage is legal how is it possible to consider delta text min and the same thing the first is the standard deviation of the aleatory variable while the second one is the physical value of momentum so id like to understand if there is another way to determine the zero point energy of system only using the heisenberg uncertainty principle
353984 in school at least in russia we are taught about the light as em wave with wave particle duality the nature of waves is described as recursive emitting electric and magnetic fields chain then its mentioned that all objects have such duality could be represented as waves with help of the de broglie formula much latter accidentally faced the fact that the de broglie wave is not em wave at all but for em quantum its similar enough frequency possibly phase while there are still lot vague moments with em waves for me is it right that em wave is just classic outdated concept and the waves of probability amplitude describing the probability of specific energy quantum to have specific coordinate is much closer to reality so there is no chain of changing electric and magnetic fields at all if you find my question too narrow minded just explain it as for year old child
353986 when we encounter problem in physics which can be expressed in terms of matrices or tensors why do we decompose the tensor in terms of its symmetric and antisymmetric or trace components what is the physics motivation behind doing so
354098 lets say we have closed system with states in hilbert space mathcal every state can be expressed as sum of energy eigenstates in closed system like box of atoms entropy will increase until the entire system is in thermal equilibrium however when we write state as sum of energy eigenstates time evolution merely contributes phase to each basis state it doesnt seem to me as though states get any more disordered over time so how can the entropy increase let me phrase my question differently recall professor once writing log dim mathcal on the board certainly the dimensionality of hilbert space does not change under time evolution so how can entropy increase under time evolution is the above equation only correct under certain conditions there must be big flaw in my reasoning memory
354159 ive studied bit of frequency analysis with fft and optimal phase binning and was taught that we can represent any composite waveform as the sum of its component frequencies understand the maths works and gives meaningful results that we can use for design or to solve problems but does this mean that sine waves are natural element like particles are for matter but in the time domain 4th dimension something that occurs in nature or are they mathematical construct that helps us interpret nature do pure single frequencies occur through natural phenomena or processes was taught about tuning forks but without having tested it assume they will produce some harmonics as the straight bars have more than one mode of vibration then thought about the rotation of the planets but they are not pure sinusoids either since the gravity of other planets affects their rotation finally thought about light but only lasers have single frequency and as far as know they dont occur naturally assume im not the first human asking this question are you aware of any academic work on this matter
354263 have kind of dumb question what would happen if the color gauge group is so3 instead of su3 assuming there are still colors and physical states are still color singlets will we get different zoo of hadrons
354314 explanations of conductors in electrostatics that have encountered seem to describe positive charge spreading out because you could say that lack of electrons can be thought of as abundance of protons that in itself is not trivial to me can any system of negative charges be replaced by another system of positive charges creating identical field lines if we theoretically removed all electrons from the conductor this is theoretically possible isnt it would be left with bunch of stationary positive charges as the protons of the atoms which are spread somewhat evenly across the volume of the conductor and not the surface as would have happened with mobile positive charges as far as know this make electric field inside possible which is not what textbooks and lectures indicate that happens what would happen in reality
354554 typical atmosphere near sea level in ambient conditions is around pascals but the pascal as the unit is not defined through earth atmospheric pressure its defined as one newton per square meter the newton is rm kg over so rm pa kg over nowadays definitions of units are often fixed to various natural phenomena but it wasnt quite so when they were being created the second is an ancient unit derived from fraction of day of synodic day on earth the meter is derived from circumference of earth the distance from north pole to equator the kilogram came to be as mass of cubic decimeter of water pascals or bar though is about the average atmospheric pressure at sea level thats an awfully round number while earth atmosphere pressure doesnt seem to have anything in common with the rest of the sources of the other units is this round value accidental or am missing some hidden relation
354889 am layman in physics and just read about black holes on the internet read that matter encounters geodesic incompleteness in the singularity in an uncharged black hole heard an analogy of geodesic incompleteness as straight line on paper reach hole on the paper so it cannot continue but in this analogy isnt the straight line possible to continue into 3d continue down the paper so if matter reaches the singularity is it possible too to reach another dimension also heard that the matter is annihilated when reaching the singularity does it mean it disappear from this world and violates conservation of energy
355224 recall being told once that hollow rods shafts tend to resist torsion more than solid rods shafts but wasnt told why this is the case now that im little older running this fact through my mind my intuition tells me that solid rod should be able to resist torsion better than hollow one assuming the wall of the hollow one is thick enough to withstand being dimpled in the process but need this verified quick spot of googling didnt lead to any answers maybe it did but couldnt comprehend most of the stuff out there way off topic for high school student physics se has this post thats similar to my question however that post requires comparison between hollow shafts and solid shafts resistance to bending whereas want to know about their resistance to torsion vaguely understood the ideas expressed in the answers there still trying to wrap my head around the second moment of inertia but im not sure if those ideas apply to torsion as well as bending of the shafts can someone tell me in simplified way not too simplified though dont want to miss out on all the good stuff why hollow shaft tends to resist torsion better than solid one since it was mentioned in the question linked the two possible cases that arise are solid and hollow rods of same diameter solid and hollow rods of same mass
355351 consider quantum system in an eigenstate rangle of the position operator hat which means that hat rangle rangle hope that the expected value of hat will be since the state rangle is the one in which the system is located in the position to prove it we do the following begin equation langle hat rangle langle hat rangle langle rangle langle rangle end equation now langle rangle deltax so think that langle rangle would be infty and then begin equation langle hat rangle pm infty quad text depending on the sign of end equation which is clearly wrong how do you calculate this mean value
355366 would like to cite relevant document that guides usage of si units it seems like currently there are two nearly identical literature sources 8th edition of si brochure issued by bipm nist special publication the international system of units which one should be used for the reference also both of them lack ids such as isbn or doi cannot find any so how to cite the right source preferably biblatex example if possible
355515 please refrain from quoting general relativity id like to know whether the exchange of virtual higgs bosons which are responsible for giving particles their masses can produce an attractive force between particles you may mention other virtual particles such as the graviton if it is helpful this is really confusing me because kept wondering how the momentum is transferred by the virtual particle presuming virtual higgs boson or virtual graviton theoretically
355525 im very confused about the pauli exclusion principle wikipedia states it as two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state in quantum system understand this for electrons that for each energy level in an atom there are two possible electrons that may occupy this energy state but with opposite spin numbers what about for protons and neutrons protons and neutrons are both fermions so why in nucleus can multiple protons and neutrons simultaneously exist understand that neutrons and protons are not identical fermions but considering them individually suppose in nucleus with protons are the energies of individual protons different from one another and similarly for neutrons in the nucleus apologies im not very familiar with quantum theory or the maths involved super confused about how the exclusion principle works for protons and neutrons the only explanations ive been able to find consider protons and state that they can have different spin what happens when we consider more than protons neutrons
355566 consider quantum mechanical system whose hilbert space of states is mathbb and has hamiltonian hat begin pmatrix 0e 0e end pmatrix describe the time evolution of the system am not exactly sure how exactly to start off here and guessing that the time evolution operator is required know that hat frac hbar hat but not sure how to proceed further
355726 in my textbook it is written that for collision physical contact is not necessary condition how can collision occur without physical contact if there is no physical contact then there would be no contact force between particles to act as impulsive force what would act as impulsive force in such collision where there is no physical contact between the particles can you give an example of such collision
355774 im giving high school lecture and want to introduce the potential energy of spring my students have not learned the hookes law and the notion of integral is too advanced im really trying to justify with hand waving argument that the energy is given by frac kd to do so let them realize that stretching compressing the spring will change its energy so this lets me justify why it only depends on the properties of the spring captured by and the deformation then by looking at the units of energy they should realize that the deformation has to be squared and that the constant takes care of the remaining units but if student argues that could be defined with other units so that the dependence in is linear could answer that the energy should be identical whether the spring is stretched compressed so that only or 2n are possible solutions see how to justify that is not physical solution because it would create cusp in the energy in and that nature does not like that at their level at least additionally having is just the simplest case my missing argument is therefore how to justify that the energy is the same when spring is stretched compressed by please keep answers light on the mathematics
355926 as it turns out analytic solutions of the schr dinger equation are available for only very small number of relatively simple model hamiltonians of which the quantum harmonic oscillator the particle in box the dihydrogen cation and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives even the helium atom which contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen atom has defied all attempts at fully analytic treatment wikipedia why for example doesnt the helium atom have an analytic solution what about the other noble gases are the other formulations of qm more successful if its to hard to answer all subquestions please answer partially maybe all answers together will draw fuller picture
356065 would like to know the meaning of an operator to the power of minus often see it in papers but do not know how it is defined for example in this paper on page of the pdf the following has been written begin align mu frac mu square mu mu nu varepsilon mu nu alpha frac partial alpha mu nu frac mu mu nu varepsilon mu nu alpha frac partial alpha mu nu end align there are two things here that am unsure of the first is the factor frac mu square mu how is this things action on functions mu defined the second is the term in the second line which has exponent 1i just cant see how these operators which are in the denominator can act on functions which are in the numerator the only way can make sense of this is if it is interpreted as taylor series but then think things would be very ugly one more thing if have the following equation begin align square mu square psi alpha beta gamma end align can somehow conclude that this implies square mu psi alpha beta gamma by applying square or something along these lines
356173 was discussing about the theory that claims that every emitter also behaves like receptor are emitters always receptors was brilliantly told that this theory would be false for fluorescent lights and also for resistors because of entropy messing with time reversed operations condensed version however as im curious by nature made this little experiment heating ohm resistor with flame and measure its voltage with cheap multimeter what surprise to discover that some current flowed from this hot resistor at measured 0mv after seconds of heating it was mv current around have just discovered some kind of reversed first joules law or did made some logical methodological or experimental mistakes
356257 this was question on worksheet during my first week in class on electromagnetism the answer is essentially no life would be no different if electrons were positively charged and protons were negatively charged opposite charges would still attract and like charges would still repel the designation of charges as positive and negative is merely definition but how would we have negative charges within the nucleus taking look at the wikipedia page for residual strong force it seems that down quarks are required in this new negative proton to help with creating the pion to transmit residual part of the strong force even between colorless hadrons tried to set out and try to find particle with charge with down quark by going through this list of baryons but all the particles are not stable with the exception of two unknown bottom xi baryon double bottom xi baryon assuming one of the above are stable could the strong force act between one of them and neutron implying its alright to have negatively charged nucleus edit if it wasnt clear my question concerned whether or not there existed stable baryons of charge with down quarks that could replace the proton
356366 in free body diagrams such as beam attached horizontally to wall is always shown acting on the center of gravity of an object my question is this the case in real life where gravity only acts on this point of the object or is gravity acting on all parts of the object but that point is at the exact center of all the force
356412 what is meant by enthalpy my professor tells me heat content that literally makes no sense heat content to me means internal energy but clearly that is not what enthalpy is considering pv and either way they would not have had two words mean the same thing then understand that this statement is mathematical formulation of the statement at constant pressure enthalpy change may be interpreted as heat other than this have no idea what or means so what does mean
356551 here is picture of my power adapter you can see in has one green led lit when charging now here is picture of my mirror with beveled edges when view the power adapter in the mirror see three projections of the led the original plus two ghost leds one on either side can someone explain how the mirrors bevels are able to cause these triplicate projections and why does it only appear to affect the led except near the edges if the mirror had different bevel pattern for example in the following image would it affect the number of ghost projections update for what its worth took another picture late at night with the camera lens as close to the mirror as possible to maximize the angle of reflection doing this showed me ghost projections which is mostly in line with agent ls answer there are actually many more after but as every next one is lets say dimmer than the previous only the first is noticeable apologies for the poor image quality
356706 the third kepler law states that begin equation frac frac pi gm end equation where is the period of the orbital movement is the semimajor axis is the mass of the sun and is the mass of the planet this is counterintuitive to me because believed that gravitational motion was independent of the mass of the orbiting planet since the mass cancels out from the beginning when one states newtons law furthermore thought that this had to do with some fundamental things asociated with gravity being geometrical theory that doesnt depend on your mass but just on the geometry of your trajectory why does the period depend on the mass of the planet then
356709 push my hand into wall the wall pushes at my hand thats why dont fall through the wall but what if get sledgehammer and smash through the wall now all see is newtons third law working up until point where the wall cant exert big enough force to react against the sledgehammer so newtons third law isnt universal edit wait guys you are not making sense to me but tell me if this is wrong or right is it because the wall pushes back against the sledgehammer with an equal and opposite force as they interact but when the wall breaks its just like the hammer is going through the air like the wall isnt there anymore
356776 just want to get an idea what momentum is know the mathematical meaning that momentum is mv where is velocity but dont know its significance like know that acceleration is how velocity is changing with respect to time wanted to get feel of what momentum really is
356886 earlier questions under similar title referred to the short range of the strong force my question is completely different id like to know why gluons are considered massless in the standard model regardless of the range of the strong force for example if mass is result of the higgs interactions then why do gluons not interact with the higgs boson in addition to the theoretical reasons is there any experimental evidence of gluons being actually massless do realize that such experiments are not easy because of the confinement in the past neutrinos were also considered massless but not anymore is there similar possibility for gluons to have perhaps small invariant mass or is there an overriding reason for them to be definitely massless edit the answer ive been looking for is deep in the comments below and not immediately apparent to make it clear am repeating it here to interact with boson particle the higgs must have charge mediated by this boson the higgs has weak charge and therefore interacts with the and bosons thus giving them mass the higgs does not have the electric or color charge and therefore does not interact with the photon or gluons thus leaving them massless
357039 ive just watched this video on youtube called bells theorem the quantum venn diagram paradox dont quite understand why it is considered paradox at he says that as you rotate polarizing filters less and less photons come through the 2nd filter and when the angle is degrees of photons come through then at he adds the 3rd filter in the middle rotated by degrees and expect two degrees polarizing filters to be equal to one degrees filter but degrees filter degrees filter relative to each other does not equal to one degrees filter right why does he expect it to be dont understand why hes so surprised saying somehow introducing another filter actually lets more light through at whats so surprising about it he rotated the 2nd filter by degrees allowing photons with polarization of degrees since degrees is of degrees range to come through why would they have any problems coming through the 3rd one which rotated degrees relative to the 2nd one at he says the more filters you add the more light comes through well no kidding by adding more filters between the first filter degrees and the last one degrees you just widening the polarization range photons can have youre basically allowing of photons from the 2nd filter to go through to the end so in theory using perfect filters the amount of photons you can see will gradually increase and by the time you add more filters with step of degree youll be able to see the same amount of photons as you could after the 2nd filter
357119 if gravity field force has an elementary particle the graviton why dont other field forces like magnetic fields have their elementary particles mean why isnt there magneton or what elementary particle is associated with the magnetic field is there boson for the magnetic field if one considers the magnetic field to be special type of em field with amplitude electric field then should you expect to detect photon when you place photon detector near magnetic field
357387 get that forces can be classified as either conservative or non conservative depending on whether the work done in round trip is zero or non zero what property of the force makes it to be conservative or non conservative so that the work done in round trip is zero non zero note im not asking the conditions for force to be conservative im asking what exactly makes it conservative
357860 have been asked this question by school kids colleagues and family usually less formally when ascending flight of stairs you exchange mechanical work to attain potential energy ascend pot cdot cdot however when descending you have to exert an equivalent force to stop yourself from accelerating and hitting the ground with splat sqrt cdot cdot if you arrive downstairs with vertical splat you counteracted basically all of your potential energy int fh cdot dh descend approx pot cdot cdot so is the fact that ascending stairs is commonly perceived as significantly more exhausting than descending the same stairs purely biomechanical thing having joints instead of muscles absorb counteract kinetic energy or is there physical component am missing edit1 feel need to clarify some points in reaction to the first answers the only reason introduced velocity into the question was to show that you actually have to expend energy going downstairs to prevent ending up as wet spot on the floor at the bottom of the steps the speed with which you ascend or descend doesnt make difference when talking about the energy which is why formulated the question primarily using energy and mechanical work imagine that while ascending you pause for tiny moment after each step regardless of wether you ascended very slowly or very quickly you would have invested the same amount of work and gained the same amount of potential energy delta cdot cdot delta step delta pot the same holds true while descending after each step you would have gained kinetic energy equivalent to kin cdot cdot delta step but again imagine you take tiny pause after each step for each step you will have to exert force with your legs such that you come to complete stop at least in direction however fast or slow you do it you mathematically will end up expending step int fh cdot dh cdot cdot delta step if you expended any less brake work some of your kinetic energy in direction would remain for each step and adding that up over number of steps would result in an arbitrarily high terminal velocity at the bottom of the stairs since we usually survive descending stairs my argument is that you will have to expend approximately the same amount of energy going down as going up in order to reach the bottom of arbitrarily long flights of stairs safely with approx am quite positive fairly sure that friction does not play significant role in this thought experiment air friction as well as friction between your shoes and the stairs should be pretty much the same while ascending and descending in both cases it would be basically the same amount of additional energy expenditure still yielding identical total energy emounts for ascending and descending anna is of course right in pointing out that you need the friction between your shoes and the stairs to be able to exert any force at all without slipping such as on ice but in the case of static friction without slippage no significant amount of energy should be dissipated since said friction exerts force mainly in direction but the deceleration of your body has mostly component since the component is roughly constant while moving on the stair orthogonal directions of frictional force and movement so no energy lost to friction work edit2 reactions to some more comments and replies added some emphasis to provide structure to wall of text no am not arguing that descending is subjectively less exhausting am asking why it is less exhausting when the mechanics seem to indicate it shouldnt be there is no free or automatic normal force emanating from the stairs that stops you from accelerating the normal force provided by the mechanic stability of the stairs stops the stairs from giving in when you step on them alright but you have to provide an equal and opposite force from your legs to decelerate your center of gravity otherwise you will feel the constraining force of the steps in very inconveniencing manner try not using your leg muscles when descending stairs if you are not convinced please use short stairs for your own safety also as several people pointed out we as humans have no way of using or reconverting our stored potential energy to decelerate ourselves we do not have built in dynamo or similar device that allows us to do anything with it while descending the stairs we actually have to get rid of it in order to not accelerate uncontrollably am well aware that energy is never truly lost but also the energy diversion instead of expenditure process some commenters suggested is flawed most answers use some variation of the argument im discussing in or you just need to relax let go to go downhill which is true but you still have to decelerate which leads to my original argument that decelerating mathematically costs exactly as much energy as ascending some of the better points so far were first brought up by dmckee and yakk your muscles have to continually expend chemical energy to sustain force even if the force is not acting in the sense of cdot holding up heavy object is one example of that this point merits more discussion will post about that later today you might use different muscle groups in your legs while ascending and descending making ascending more exhausting for the body while not really being harder energetically this is right up the alley of what meant by biomechanical effects in my original post edit in order to address as well as f1 lets try and convert the process to explicit kinematics and equations of motion will try to argue that the force you need to exert is the same during ascent and descent both over direction amount of work and over time since your muscles expend energy per time to be able to exert force when ascending or descending stairs you bounce little to not trip over the stairs your center of gravity moves along the axis of the image with two components your rougly linear ascent descent depends on steepness of stairs here for simplicity and component that models the bounce in your step also alternating of legs the image assumes hx cdot cos2 pi cdot here is the height of your cog over the stairs depends on body height and weight distribution but is ultimately without consequence and is the amplitude of the bounce in your step by derivation we obtain velocity and acceleration in direction vx pi cdot sin2 pi cdot ax pi cdot cos2 pi cdot the total force your legs have to exert has two parts counteracting gravity and making you move according to ax so fx cdot cdot ax the next image shows fx for and kg interpret the image as showing the following in order to gain height you forcefully push with your lower leg counteracting gravity and gaining momentum in direction this corresponds to the maxima in the force plotted roughly in the center of each step your momentum carries you to the next step gravity slows your ascent such that on arriving on the next step your velocity in direction is roughly zero not plotted vx during this period of time right after completely straightening the pushing lower leg your leg exerts less force remaining force depending on the bounciness of your stride and you land with your upper foot getting ready for the next step this corresponds to the minima in fx the exact shape of hx and hence fx can be debated but they should look qualitatively similar to what outlined my main points are walking down the stairs you read the images right to left instead of left to right your hx will be the same and hence fx will be the same so desc int fx cdot dx asc the spent amounts of energy should be equal in this case the minima in fx correspond to letting yourself fall to the next step as many answers pointed out but crucially the maxima correspond to exerting large force on landing with your lower leg in order to hold your weight up against gravity and decelerate your fall to near zero vertical velocity if you move with roughly constant velocity fx is proportional to ft this is important for the argument that your muscles consume energy based on the time they are required to exert force muscle approx int ft cdot dt reading the image right to left ft is read right to left but keeps its shape since the time required for each segment of the ascent is equal to the equivalent falling descent portion time symmetry of classical mechanics the integral muscle remains constant as well this result carries over to non linear muscle energy consumption functions that depend on higher orders of ft to model strength limits muscle exhaustion over time and so on
357970 closed kepler orbits are ellipses with the sun at one focus the force felt by the planet points in the direction of the sun as such it is not central force since the focus is not the center am confused the force should be central what is my misunderstanding

358355 the lorentz transform for spinors is not unitary that is lambda dagger neq lambda understand that this is because it is impossible to choose representation of the clifford algebra where all the gamma matrices are hermitian however does this not go against the conventional wisdom of wigners theorem which says that symmetry operations are needed to be either unitary of anti unitary for the invariance of observable properties across frames how can one reconcile this with the transformation above
358842 perhaps since the standard model relies heavily on the symmetries of chosen groups do either or both theories demand maximum number of particles or fields that are allowed to exist my guess is that someone has asked this but cannot find it in the similar questions section or the questions that may already have your answer section
358894 if arranged an experiment where light raced electricity what would be the results lets say red laser is fired at the same time switch is closed that applies volts to gauge loop of copper wire with meter at distance of ten meters also does the speed of the electricity depend on the voltage applied or the resistance of the conductor for this test lets say the distance is ten meters through air im not looking for an exact answer an approximation is fine
358943 suppose am an alien living on distant planet very big distant planet one day thought of making planet on my own went to nearby land and using my ultra heavy duty land moving machine drilled out some kilos of mud then dumped it into my space vehicle and went off in search for gravity free space using my supersensitive gravimeter found place and opened my vehicle and set all the mud to float freely in space knew that the particles would eventually coagulate according to the frac gm 1m rule given that my life time is very long will ever get to see planet out of my mud now if wait long enough will make star out of my planet thinking little deeper will my planet be watery since water evaporates and suddenly freezes in space according to water in vacuum or space and temperature in space the water in the mud instantly vaporizes and spreads out which means wont get watery planet after all but the same link says the water recrystallizes into ice once thrown out in space does that mean that the ice would return to the planet due to its gravity and due to pressure form water making my planet watery again
358956 am reading the elegant universe by brian greene in many places its directly indirectly mentioned that the lhc may not be able to detect with the current technology heavy particles to prove super symmetry what prevents such accelerators from detecting such heavy particles always thought it would be the opposite as heavy particles can make stronger impression on detectors than light particles

359088 understand that particles interact via the fundamentals forces of nature for example photons interact with matter because they carry the change in the electromagnetic field neutrinos on the other hand do not interact with the electromagnetic field and so go through matter with almost no interaction however neutrinos still have size and mass so can neutrino hit an electron which also has size though unlikely that is since neutrinos do not interact with the electromagnetic field they would not be deflected so can two particles like neutrino and an electron hit head on
359381 in my physics book it says that in the human ear the sensation of loudness is approximately logarithmic and that the relative sound intensity is directly proportional to logarithmic ratio expressed as follows beta log frac so does that mean an average human wont perceive for example sound of intensity frac to be as twice as loud as sound that has an intensity of frac while they will perceive sound that is db to be twice as loud as one that is 5db
359604 in qed the fine structure constant alpha runs upwards in the uv with loop calculation involving geometric series of the vacuum polarisation diagram indicating divergence in alpha at sim text ev it is often claimed see for instance schwartz qft and the standard model section that this means qed is an incomplete theory at high energies or that it is not predictive at these energies and that some uv completion is required however qcd is another theory with landau pole in the ir this time at sim100 text mev neverthless qcd is theory valid down to arbitrarily low energies it is merely non perturbative in this regime my understanding is that the landau pole is an artefact of extrapolating perturbative calculation of the coupling strength alpha into the non perturbative regime in fact there is no divergence in alpha although explicitly calculating it is impossible or perhaps not even meaningful with current tools and understanding therefore whilst perturbation theory clearly breaks down in qed at very high energies is it not possible that qed is perfectly legitimate and consistent theory up to arbitrarily high energies in much the same way that qcd is at low energies is the qed landau pole really there said another way is there really any link between the point at which perturbation theory breaks down and the point at which the theory stops being predictive perhaps these are linked when were working with an eft with infinitely many terms whose coefficients are unconstrained but if we postulate the qed lagrangian as fundamental is it not at least in principle predictive up to arbitrarily high energies
360007 there is question that explains work and energy on stack exchange but did not see this aspect of my problem please just point me to my error and to the correct answer that missed what am asking is this why in physics when the units are the same that does not necessarily mean you have the same thing let me explain please let me use for meter sec second and kg kilogram as the units for brevity sake the units for work are kg sec the units for kinetic energy are kg sec they look that same to me need them to be the same so can figure out the principle of least action comments are welcome
360211 when writing the equations of motion for the simple pendulum why do textbooks always choose theta to be the generalized coordinate the force of gravity is in the direction so wouldnt it be natural to write everything in terms of instead of theta since the string is of fixed length we can write sqrt and so shouldnt we be able to write the equations of motion completely in terms of

360582 what do mean there are two kind of equalities or two ways to interpret an equality take for example the ideal gas law pv nk bt we all know what this equation means when you calculate both sides of the equation you find the same physical quantity this equation in other words is saying that temperature of an ideal gas is proportional to the pressure and the volume of the enclosing container and inversely proportional to the number of molecules of the gas there are so many of these equations in physics but there is another more subtle kind take this other equation about from the statistics of ideal gas langle rangle frac mv rms frac bt now this equation can also be taken as an expression of proportionality however this can also be taken as definition for temperature we can read this equation to mean that temperature macroscopic phenomenon is the average kinetic energy of gas particle up to multiplication incidentally one take ma in similar way for example when we are in rotating or generally accelerated frame the equation actually defines the fictional force in terms of the acceleration so is pi an expression of proportionality or definitional identity and why follow up the ideal gas law does not tell us why lhs rhs it expresses law it does not explain nature on the other hand the second equation informs us on the nature of temperature it explains nature it tells us this is what temperature is find these kinds of equations very satisfying and they are much rarer in physics if you disagree on any of this please leave comment am interested
360690 since mathbf cdot mathbf is lorentz invariant of the electromagnetic fields it seems like an interesting thing to plug into lagrangian to see what happens however this ends up disappearing and im told this should be obvious because it is total derivative this however is not obvious to me is there an easy way to see that frac epsilon alpha beta gamma delta alpha beta gamma delta frac left mathbf cdot mathbf right is actually total derivative id also appreciate if someone can show what it is the derivative of so that can work out the derivative to help it sink in
360930 our high school teacher told us that the earth pulls us with some force and we pull the earth with the same force within newtonian physics this is true because of newtons 3rd law but let consider einsteinian gravity my mass is small so don warp space time much but earth large mass warps space time to far greater extent so do pull earth with the same force it pulls me if yes how
360989 it is often stated that points in the space of quantum field theories for which all parameters are invariant under renormalisation that is to say fixed points of the rg evolution are scale invariant field theories certainly this should be necessary condition since the theory must look the same at all scales however have doubts whether this is sufficient in the classical theory there is no notion of renormalisation but nevertheless we can talk about scale invariant theories these theories possess global dilatation symmetry theories with inherent mass scales such as phi theory with non zero quadratic term are not classically conformal because they lack such symmetry it seems to me that the vanishing or perhaps blowing up of such dimensionful couplings must also be condition to impose on quantum field theory if we wish for it to be scale invariant my question is then are the dimensionful couplings of all fixed points in rg flow necessarily trivial is it impossible for an rg fixed point to have some mass scale neq in its lagrangian as see it either the answer is yes in which case being at fixed point is enough to guarantee scale invariance or the answer is no in which case we also need to make an additional requirement of our theories if we wish for them to be conformal beyond the vanishing of all beta functions
361196 since represents an note hz tone also represents an since it is at the frequency however when generate this note in audacity always get unwanted frequencies appearing as small peaks below the fundamental and all the harmonics heres an example of hz sawtooth wave generated at hz sample rate you can clearly see those small peaks starting at hertz what causes these unwanted frequencies to appear edit finally realised that these ghost frequencies are actually the result of aliasing because the sawtooth wave is not being band limited id est not having its maximum frequency limited the harmonics beyond the nyquist frequency are being mirrored down to frequencies whose hertz are multiples of the greatest common divisor between the fundamental frequency and the sample rate in this case the gcd between and is which explains the aliases appearing at multiples of hz another example would be the fact that hz sawtooth wave generated non bandlimited at hz would produce aliases at multiples of hz
361590 my friend and are discussing whether or not physical phenomena are deterministic lets say for example that we have dimensional box with balls inside of it upon which no gravitational forces are acting the balls each have their own size mass starting position and starting velocity after given amount of time the balls will have changed positions and possibly also velocities due to movement and possible collisions with other balls the question is does the same initial state always lead to the same state after given amount of time in other words if we have two boxes of the same size with the same number of balls of the same size starting at the same positions with the same initial velocities will the balls inside of each box be at the same positions as we would expect from deterministic system or would there be any randomness involved
361620 when maxwells equations are solved one of the solutions is electromagnetic waves that should move at certain speed frac sqrt mu epsilon now one could argue that since maxwells equations hold for all observers regardless of their reference frame they should all see these waves with speed so the speed of these waves must be independent of your reference frame moreover lets say you could observe someone travelling at more than this speed of electromagnetic waves now someone in this reference frame produced these waves also there is wall in front of them that is destroyed if the electromagnetic wave touches it it is powerful laser and if the person in this reference frame hits the wall he dies now from your perspective he will die since he is travelling faster than the wave and will reach it first however the person himself would be sure he could survive if he fired the electromagnetic wave at the wall before he got to it so he would be sure he would not die this leads to contradiction and so it must be impossible to observe reference frame that travels faster than this speed of the electromagnetic waves suspect there is probably hole in this line of argument but cant imagine what it is

361935 am wondering about this question since asked myself why do people feel more weightless in the rear car of roller coaster than in the front car to feel the effect of weightlessness you must accelerate at the acceleration of the gravity around 8m thus you do not feel that effect in the front car but more likely in the rear car but all the cars are connected together and one individual car cannot accelerate faster or go faster because they will get pulled pushed from the other cars am stuck right now to get the answer if all cars must go at the same acceleration or same speed at different points on the tracks why does the rear car feel more weightless to have that feeling you must accelerate near the gravitational acceleration it doesnt make sense have put the air friction the frictional forces outside of this since am guessing their force shouldnt be taken in consideration in that kind of situation
362109 part in the classical theory of electromagnesitm as given by maxwell we know that by just looking at the four famous equations an electric field has source there are charged particles non zero divergeance whereas theres no such equivalence for the magnetic field there are no known magnetic charges and roughly that the change in time of either field generates the other despite the difference in and it is nonetheless known that electric and magnetic fields are just different views of the same physical thing that is by considering the relative motion of charges in different frames we observe magnetic field being generated or equivalently static electric field although understand the reasoning behind this as we are simply switching frames once being at rest to the charge once being in motion relative to it it remains still very confusing picture to help clarify matters are we saying that based on the classical maxwellian theory of electromagnetism magnetism has no fundamental physical meaning instead its all about the behaviour of charged particles part on the other hand in our modern theories of qm and qft we quickly learn about new fundamental physical property other than the charge namely the spin and how it is at the very core of everything in magnetism taking simple toy models such as all the ising variants we explain all sorts of magnetic behaviours ferromagnetism paramagnetism and phase transitions between them based on the understanding of how spins interact how they can be locked in blocks of same orientation how they respond to an external field and so on moreover unlike the concept of charge spin extends to photons as well where mathematically we assign half integer spins to fermions electrons and integer ones to bosons photons compared to the starting discussion of the classical theory the contrasting feature here is the fact that magnetism deals with the spin properties of system and not the charges meaning that there does not seem to be dual equivalence anymore between magnetic fields and electric fields based on qm is there way to meaningfully connect these two pictures that of the classical theory of electromagnetism to the modern understanding of charges spins in qm for example we know that part is macroscopic theory so as consistency check is it possible to retrieve the results therein but starting from the modern picture the collective behaviour of fermions in our modern understanding of the electromagnetic theory considering relativistic and quantum mechanical corrections do we still treat magnetic fields and electric fields as different views of the same thing this has been my attempt at claryfing what is confusing me hopefully the questions are not too vague as they stand please let me know if any additional details and clarification are required although this post is not necessarily literature recommendation one any books or papers that you think will help me better understand this whole matter are perfectly welcome
362354 or couple of them on the moon it seems to me that its seismically pretty quiet there with no trucks bouncing around on nearby highway messing things up maybe four ligos at the vertices of regular tetrahedron that should make for pretty good gravitational wave observatory dont ya think it seems to me that ligo in space might be hard to deal with and having known and fixed positions relative to each other is important and would be hard to guarantee in space
362780 was reading up on the clay institutes millenium prizes in mathematics and noticed the navier stokes equations were described as minimally understood as far as was taught in physics few weeks agoscqf level they are used but solutions to them are hard to find in three dimensions because they require large amounts of computational power due to the complexity of the equations and so approximations are used how were the equations discovered in the first place if we cant solve them

363126 as understand it during boiling the input of heat destroys or re arranges the hydrogen bonds it is used in other words against the potential energy of the intermolecular bonds but if some hydrogen bonds between molecules are destroyed then why is the kinetic energy of these particular molecules not increased and consequently temperature
363211 by strange mean is there reason for this or is it something we accept as peculiarity of our universe see no reason why if magnetic field is in the direction and charges velocity is in the direction that the force experienced by the charge cant be in either the or direction both are perpendicular to and the equation for lorentz force just tells us that it goes in the direction but it seems equally valid that the force would be in the direction mean theres nothing to distinguish from anyway you can turn one into the other by swapping the handedness of your coordinate system it seems as if the universe is preferentially selecting one direction over the other as practical example if current carrying wire is in magnetic field and it experiences an upward force why shouldnt it experience downward force
363306 just recently ligo and virgo successfully detected new signs of gravitational waves this time instead of colliding black holes it is pair of colliding neutron stars this collision emits light and gravitational waves read in cnn first seen neutron star collision that this collision had signal that lasted for seconds read before that the first gravitational wave detection of two colliding black holes had signal lasting for split second and this is also an indication of how long the merging takes place is this accurate if so if the colliding neutron star has signal lasting for 100s does that mean that the merging takes longer time in addition if the merging of two black holes happen almost instantly short time then why does the merging of two neutron star take up more amount of time
363394 was looking for examples of conservative and non conservative vector fields and stumbled on the question is magnetic force non conservative and in the answer section it is stated the magnetic force cannot be vector field so it cannot possibly be considered conservative as am learning the maths for divergence and curl naturally wanted to find some examples to help my intuition and that is what leads me to ask for an explanation of the explanation found on stack exchange
363490 ive often heard it said that the motion of double pendulum is non periodic this may be related to the fact that its chaotic system but im not sure about that but this does not seem possible to me for the following reason let theta and theta be the angles of the two masses relative to the vertical then we can consider the two dimensional phase space with theta axis and theta axis and the motion of the double pendulum is continuous curve gamma infty rightarrow pi times pi the thing is im pretty sure such curve must be self intersecting because if its not self intersecting then its graph would cover more and more of the codomain with time and so think youd get space filling curve and yet space filling curves are always self intersecting so youd get contradiction thus gamma must be self intersecting and thus the motion of double pendulum is always periodic so whats wrong with my reasoning or is my reasoning correct and is the motion of double pendulum always periodic just with such long period that it looks non periodic if so is there formula for the period
363541 know about the definition of differentiable manifold and that the transition functions psi circ psi psi circ psi are the way to construct the notion of coordinate transformation change of charts but even after reading walds sean carrolls and nightingales books unfortunately didnt grasp why we perform coordinates transformations like displaystyle frac partial partial mean didnt connect the abstract notion of coordinate transformation by the transition functions with the notion of coordinate transformation by partial derivatives furthermore know that the functions psi are differentiable but why priori we want to differentiate then
363748 could you please give an intuitive definition of chemical potential it seems that it is an extremely important notion of physics but definitions are really vague
364208 lets say have eigenstates rangle associated with measurement of position know that the eigenstates corresponding to their respective eigenvalues form basis lets call it now lets say want to expand generic state vector rangle in that basis formed by eigenstates now what does it mean when physicists say that is the coordinate of the state rangle in the basis any explanation or reference to similar kind of questions would be helpful
364488 https en wikipedia org wiki position and momentum space https en wikipedia org wiki pontryagin duality am trying to understand logic behind the uncertainity principle and as far as understand it follows mathematically if we assume that wave function in momentum space is fourier transform of the wave function in position space tried to dig in and find out why they should be related so and the only explanation could find out was pontryagin duality
364771 ive been told it is never seen in physics and bad taste to have it in cases of being the argument of logarithmic function or the function raised to cant seem to understand why although suppose it would be weird to raise dimensionless number to the power of something with dimension
365390 ive recently come across strange result when comparing the hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics suppose we are working in the regime where we can say the hamiltonian is equal to the total energy tag that is the constraints are holonomic and time independent and the potential is vq where the generalized position vector 1q ldotsq let tag be the lagrangian now the euler lagrange equations tell us frac dt frac partial partial dot sigma frac partial partial sigma tag for the generalized coordinate sigma with sigma in ldotsn we also know that the conjugate momenta are defined by sigma frac partial partial dot sigma so this equation tells us dot sigma frac partial partial sigma tag in the hamiltonian formalism we know that dot sigma frac partial partial sigma tag combining these gives frac partial partial sigma frac partial partial sigma tag now this seems very strange because in the regime we are considering this implies that frac partial partial sigma frac partial partial sigma rightarrow frac partial partial sigma tag of course there are many examples where this is not true simply consider the free particle analyzed using polar coordinates then we have frac dot dot theta tag and so frac partial partial neq tag what is the explanation for this strange discrepancy am making silly mistake somewhere
365462 from multiple sources learned that in em waves electric field vectors are perpendicular to magnetic field vectors and both are perdendicular to the direction of propagation on this gif which claims it visual representation of em waves electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other but the magnetic vectors are not always perpendicular to the direction of propagation describing circles so is it an accurate representation still am missing something
366078 it has been written in goldsteins classical mechanics that in lagrangian formalism the independent dynamical variables are and thats why we represent state of system in lagrangian formalism using point in configuration space but throughout the calculations we treat dot also as an independent variable like for calculations from euler lagrange equation also goldstein mentions that mathematically we treat dot as independent variable but other than that it is not so how can mathematically independent quantity not be considered so while understanding the dynamics of the system like in stating the state of its
366089 cant understand this according to what read here the speed of wave depends on its wavelength and its depth through the relation sqrt frac lambda pi tanh left2 pi frac lambda right where lambda is the wavelength is the water depth and is the acceleration due to gravity yet the speed of sound is constant at rm but sound is product of an oscillation that provokes the molecules of the medium atmosphere to move up and down an oceanic wave is again the product of an oscillation that provokes the molecules of the medium water ocean to move up and down shouldnt both be constants just of different value since water is denser medium than air can understand the reasoning of the one but when accepting it can not understand why it does not apply to the other and vise versa am really confused here

367089 had sprain in my leg few days back the doctor recommended dipping my foot alternately in ice cold and hot water to aid blood circulation it is here that discovered something interesting the picture above shows the piece of ice that was put in the bucket the above picture shows the ice cube from above if you look at the large piece of cube from the side see below you can see that the upper part of the cube that was near the open surface of the container in which the ice froze seems to be almost transparent and has crystalline appearance the lower part does not have this appearance and it is white and opaque why is there difference in the layers of ice in the large cube is it because the water was from tap and not completely pure the water was put in the refrigerator for period greater than hours so the ice has frozen properly can anyone explain this unique structure of ice ive never seen this before update this update is to simply demonstrate the bubble formation in the icewhich causes the cloudiness out of the two answers had accepted the one by iliasmilga today the ice formed demonstrated this idea clearly given below are the pictures in which the bubbles of dissolved gas are clearly visible the last two pictures are the best

367378 in quantum mechanics qm teacher always emphasizes on the weird parts like epr paradox bell inequality and so on the bell inequality tells us that qm is either nonlocal or non realistic or both however in quantum field theory qft teacher says that physics requires locality and causality and never mentions that the nonlocality or nonrealisitc while qft is also quantum theory is there some contradiction of locality requirement of qft with nonlocal in qm or does it mean that locality of qft just implies that qm is local and nonrealistic

367717 considering potential energy of and displacement of the force is given by frac partial partial since equilibrium is defined as the point at which we can express this as frac partial partial this is clear to see on the following graph it is also clear that some equilibria are stable and some are not given small displacement at the system will return to equilibrium whereas this would not happen at hence we can say that for frac partial 2u partial 2x the equilibrium is stable whereas for frac partial 2u partial 2x the equilibrium is unstable is there general solution to this case or does each have to be considered individually what is not clear to me is the case where frac partial 2u partial 2x does this simply mean that the equilibrium is stable given displacement in one direction and not the other or is it more complicated for example if particle were to oscillate about stable equilibrium point its motion would be dampened until it were at rest but this would not be possible at point where frac partial 2u partial 2x if the particle were to move to the side where frac partial 2u partial 2x it would not return to the equilibrium point is there general solution to this case or does each case have to be considered by inspection

368186 although this question is going to seem completely trivial to anyone with any exposure to path integrals im looking to answer this precisely and havent been able to find any materials after looking for about minutes which leads me to believe that it makes sense to ask the question here in particular im looking for an answer wherin any mathematical claims are phrased as precisely as possible with detailed proofs either provided or referenced also my search for solution has led me to think im actually looking for good explenation of wick rotation which cant really claim to understand in detail any good references about this would be very welcome as well im looking to make sense of the following integral identity int infty infty dx exp lefti frac ijx right left frac pi right exp left frac ij 2a right qquad aj in mathbb wikipedia and various other sources say that this result is valid as an integration in the complex plane as long as has positive imaginary part clearly the left hand side does not exist in lebesgue sense for real an answer to the question wick rotation in field theory rigorous justification claims it is convergent as riemann integral thanks to some rather delicate cancellations to make the integral well defined equivalently to see how these cancellations occur we need to supply some additional information wick rotation provides way of doing this you observe that the left hand side is analytic in and that the right hand side is well defined if imt then you can define the integral for real by saying that its analytic continued from complex with negative imaginary part want to see the gory details and all known motivation for the validity of this procedure for the kinds of applications where such integrals occur suggestions such as include an epsilon in order to make it finite seem arbitrary in that case one would have to motivate that prescription from the very start that is within the modeling procedure that ends up giving that integral expression which is likely the correct way to approach this im also not sure how to interpret the right hand side since it involves the square root of an imaginary number which should involve some choice of branch cut which have never seen specified in connection to this formula
368378 during the discovery of the neutron by chadwick it was observed that something is emitted from beryllium when bombarded by alpha particles that could knock out protons with mev from paraffin slab and they thought it was gamma rays but later calculated thatthe gamma photon energy would have had to be at least mev which is far too much energy to be produced from beryllium interacting with an alpha particle and concluded that it was not gamma ray paraffin slab is rich in protons so is there need of high threshold energy how did they calculate the mev cant the photoelectric effect happen there so that only mev photon is needed

369162 have this simple question but cannot find the answer saw this video about plane getting hit by lightning in it captain joe explains why people do not get electrocuted this has simple explanation due to the faraday cage effect produced by the fuselage but another question come to my mind in that moment why does the aluminum from the fuselage that acts as faraday cage not melt because of the extreme currents carried by the lightning after this thought about the following example thin metal correctly grounded lightning rod is almost intact after strike while tree breaks in the middle and sometimes it even burns clearly it has something to do with the resistivity of each material much higher in the trees wood it is also said in this article that the only dangerous zone plane can get hit is the radome the nose cone as its the only part of planes shell thats not made of metal so it clearly has something to do with the conductive properties of the fuselage so my question is basically this why does tree break and burn when struck by lightning but lightning rod does not and ultimately why does plane hit by lightning not melt with the hundreds of thousands amperes going through the fuselage
369590 lets look at quantum subroutine of shors algorithm image source hadamard gates create superposition of all exponential number values for input qubits then we perform classical function on them which is here fa textrm mod where is the number we would like to factorize is some chosen usually random number smaller than then we perform measurement of value of this function fa random this measurement restricts the original ensemble to only input values such that fa mathematics says that this restricted ensemble has to be periodic this period can be concluded from value of quantum fourier transform and allows to conclude the factors however quantum computers require reversible unitary operations we cannot just use or gate xy to mathrm or and instead we need to use to mathrm xor mathrm or which is own inverse but which requires one additional auxiliary qubit initialized as so their required number is comparable with the number of gates of the classical function can be quite large but whats happening with all these auxiliary qubits at the end of computation and after the computation is over measuring the classical function has led to the crucial restriction of the original ensemble can we ensure that auxiliary qubits arent finally also measured collapsed also restricting the ensemble is there some time interval when such measurement restricts the ensemble analogously required time order between qft and measurement of classical function if not can we ensure that restriction from inevitable collapse of auxiliary qubits does not cripple our computation peter shor has confirmed below the problem with auxiliary qubits requiring to uncompute them to fixed values for proper computation process

370873 in an lc circuit or an lc tank the capacitor discharges in one direction through an inductor and then the inductor seems to carry energy in the form of magnetic field to charge the capacitor again with current in the same direction while it is clear to me why magnetic field would create that energy when it is collapsing into current dont understand how is this situation possible since it seems like the energy coming from the capacitor when its discharging somehow doubles itself to charge the capacitor again with the same amount of energy in the other direction am of course deliberately ignoring the resistance and assuming it to be zero just to isolate and understand the functionality better and so there seems to be an extra energy generated by the inductor how is it possible for the energy to be used twice once in the discharge and again in the charging in the other direction where does this extra energy come from

371162 the question below shows the velocity of three balls projected in different directions will be the same upon hitting the ground why isnt the velocity of the ball thrown horizontally the greatest wouldnt this have both horizontal velocity and vertical downward velocity due to gravity hence wouldnt its velocity be the resultant velocity sqrt horizontal velocity vertical velocity which would be greater than simply the vertical velocity of ball or following from this the kinetic energy is said to be equal in all when hitting the ground but wouldnt the horizontally projected ball have the greatest kinetic energy if it had the greatest speed source https courses physics illinois edu phys211 su2013 lectures lecture8 pdf edit after the prompts in the comments my calculations would go like this corrected due to comments only ball has horizontal component of velocity too so ball would have velocity vy ball would have vx and vy so the resultant velocity for ball would be sqrt vx vy sqrt at which would be different less than is that incorrect where acceleration due to gravity time initial speed horizontal component and vertical component

371381 does an object necessarily needs physical contact in order to move because as far as can guess energy doesnt have to be contained in matter in order to work just like heat works in distance the kinetic energy is not the only force that can make the object move
371402 assume we have started current in closed circuit which only includes capacitor no inductor for example by having battery initially disconnecting and and reclosing the circuit for dissipative conductor the current would decrease with the timescale of the inverse scattering rate what if the circuit were superconducting would there be an oscillation of the current with charge sloshing back and forth each plate of the capacitor at which frequency
371615 if you have mirrors over for each other placed exactly so they face each other perfectly and then use laser light pen as the source into one of the mirrors so it bounces to the other mirror and back again would the laser light line continue to exist between the mirrors if the source of the laser stopped if so how long could the laser light continue to be between the mirrors without source would it just continue existing between the mirrors using itself as the source or is this not possible for light note it doesnt have to be only mirrors it could be any amount of mirrors if that would change the outcome
371902 in nuclear physics when you break eg nucleus of uranium some neutrons are liberated and the original atom degrades to lighter element the energy that was used to keep these subatomic particles together is liberated strong interaction and small part of the mass is converted to energy mc so you get lot of energy with small amount of atoms so why nuclear fusion the opposite operation could even liberate much more energy would naively expect it to take lot of energy not liberate it im not physician nor student just interested in physics and this has always been mystery to me edit actually both of your answers are great and cristal clear that makes perfect sense and is exactly what was looking for wish could accept both answers but the one with the graphic was bit more complete but thank you two
372024 read an abstract here due to the bosonic nature of the photon increasing the peak intensity through combination of raising the pulse energy and decreasing the pulse duration will pile up more and more photons within the same finite region of space in the absence of material this continues until the vacuum is stressed to the point of breakdown and virtual particles become real the critical intensity where this occurs for electrons and positrons the so called schwinger limit is predicted to be cm2 according to it virtual particles can become real at certain conditions guess that means that the virtual particles of vacuum fluctuation can become real cannot judge with my limited knowledge whether this is true can somebody verify it and if it is true explain how and why it happens

372221 understand that the conservation of energy essentially says that energy can neither be destroyed or created but that it is transferred from one form to another given that on the ocean wind energy gets transferred to the sea where it then takes the form of wave ocean waves travel sometimes thousand kilometers or more when wave reaches the shore or reef it breaks my question is where does that ocean wave energy go after it breaks know it creates sound which is sound energy but that does not seem like enough where does the energy go when the sound dies out where does the energy go
372306 in chapter schwartzs quantum field theory book defines renormalizability as follows paraphrasing bit for brevity consider given subset of the operators and its complement bar choose coefficients for the operators in to be fixed at scale lambda ll lambda if there is any way to choose the coefficients of the operators in bar as function of lambda so that in the limit lambda to infty all operators have finite coefficients at lambda the theory restricted to the set is renormalizable im very confused about what schwartz is saying here the rg flow equations are just differential equations that run backward just as well as they run forward thus you can choose any couplings at lambda whatsoever for all of the operators and simply run the rg flow backwards to see what the couplings at lambda should be also dont see how this is equivalent to the usual definition of no irrelevant operators in the lagrangian moreover im not sure what the theory restricted to the set means does this mean we are supposed to forcibly set the coefficients for bar to zero at lambda could somebody shine some light on this passage
372380 we have focused our discussion on one dimensional motion it is natural to assume that for three dimensional motion force like acceleration behaves like vector introduction to mechanics kleppner and kolenkow we learn it very early in the course of our study that force is vector but if were the physicist defining the the newtons second law experimentally and analysing the result ma how would determine whether force is vector or scalarespecially in actually when read the aforementioned sentences from the book wanted to know why do the authors expect it to be natural for us to think that in force behaves like vector know aacceleration is vector and mass scalar and scalar times vector gives new vector but is there another explanation for this
372477 im uncomfortable with dimensional analysis arguments made in quantum field theory particularly those related to renormalization for example in section iii of zees qft book it says consider fermis theory of the weak interaction imagine calculating the amplitude mathcal for four fermion interaction at lowest order mathcal sim let us try to write down the amplitude to the next order by dimensional analysis the only possibility is mathcal sim lambda without cutoff on the theory or equivalently with lambda infty theorists realized that the theory was sick infinity was the predicted value for physical quantity fermis weak interaction theory was said to be nonrenormalizable this is already confusing because uv divergences occur in renormalizable theories too its also confusing why the energy scale of the process cant appear then one page later it reads here is another way of making the same point suppose we didnt know anything about cutoffs and all that then by high school dimensional analysis we see that the scattering amplitude at center of mass energy has to go as mathcal sim ldots when reaches the scale the amplitude reaches order unity and some new physics must take over these two passages seem blatantly contradictory didnt we just say wasnt allowed in the dimensional analysis how did the cutoff disappear when it really should still be there in general there always seem to be three dimensionful scales and lambda whats the right way to make dimensional analysis argument using them and why are the two passages above not inconsistent
372547 based on my current admittedly deficient understanding of physics everything in the universe is in constant change and motion is that understanding correct or is there something that is static by static mean that all of that objects properties remain constant from one moment in time to the next these properties include its position motion as well as the properties of its internal structure

373085 is it possible to formulate the schr dinger equation se in terms of differential equation involving only the probability density instead of the wave function if not why not we can take the time independent se as an example frac hbar 2m nabla psi mathbf mathbf psi mathbf psi mathbf any solution will yield probability density mathbf psi mathbf psi mathbf and the question if an equation can be found of which is the solution if psi is solution of the se assume not since it would have been widely known but have not seen the arguments why this would be impossible understand the wave function contains more information than the probability density the phase of psi which is relevant in qm drops out of but do not see that as sufficient reason against the existence of such an equation
373132 this answer by qmechanic shows that the classical liouville equation can be extended to quantum mechanics by the use of moyal star products where it takes the form frac partial rho partial frac hbar stackrel star rho ive seen this mentioned as possible classical interpretation of quantum mechanics but ive never seen this used in anger so want to ask is this representation actually useful in understanding dynamics in what contexts does it provide insights about physical processes that are harder to obtain through alternative routes im not really looking for an exhaustive list of places where this representation turns up but would like to see few representative examples to get better feel of how it looks like in applications

373250 discuss whether this statement is correct in the absence of air resistance the trajectory of projectile thrown near the earth surface is an ellipse not parabola is the above statement right to the best of my knowledge particle projected from the earths surface follows parabolic trajectory under constant acceleration of course an approximation one of my friends pointed out that in case of variable acceleration one which follows the inverse square law the path is an ellipse so what is correct if it is indeed an ellipse im having trouble deriving the equation of its trajectory could someone please post solution or method to derive the actual trajectorys equation if the parabolic trajectory is an approximation then making appropriate changes in the equation obtained should yield parabolas equation right

373357 the wp article on the density matrix has this remark it is now generally accepted that the description of quantum mechanics in which all self adjoint operators represent observables is untenable the first footnote is to the appendix in mackey mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics have copy of mackey but am unable to connect the material in the appendix to this statement also dont know anything about algebras and mackey doesnt seem to mention them either can anyone explain this at an elementary level maybe with concrete example of hermitian operator that wouldnt qualify as an observable assume this issue only arises in infinite dimensional spaces intuitively dont see how it could be an issue in finite dimensional space
373449 from my knowledge of magnetism if magnet is heated to certain temperature it loses its ability to generate magnetic field if this is indeed the case then why does the earths core which is at whopping as hot as the suns surface generate strong magnetic field
373463 was wondering and came across thought if an object is moving at particular speed say it is equivalent to say that the object is moving at cm or mm and so on clearly you can keep dividing 5m an infinite amount of times so there will be particular instance where the object has to move at infinitesimal units so how does the object manage to do that in the sense how can it move an infinite distance of any unit in second
373577 energy of light is proportional to its frequency so if light loses energy on reflecting off surface then why doesnt it change its colour

374549 what is considered wavelength am getting confused here keep seeing one wavelength is the distance when the wave repeats itself so at the two highest points thats the wavelength now im seeing one wave cycle is when the wave comes back to the starting point which is it can be missing something are these two different things and am mistakenly thinking there the same
374647 am confused as to why when dealing with ideal classical gasses the dependency of the particles being either fermions or bosons is ignored how does this relate to the energy levels within the system thought it had something to do with the fact that ideal classical gasses are at temperatures where the thermal energy kt is much greater than the spacing between the energy levels but am not entirely certain whether this is the correct way should be thinking any knowledge to make me little less ignorant on the matter will be greatly appreciated

375209 once upon time dirac said the following about renormalization in quantum field theory look here for example renormalization is just stop gap procedure there must be some fundamental change in our ideas probably change just as fundamental as the passage from bohrs orbit theory to quantum mechanics when you get number turning out to be infinite which ought to be finite you should admit that there is something wrong with your equations and not hope that you can get good theory just by doctoring up that number has this fundamental change come along afterward and if so what is the nature of this fundamental change is it an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity of which the two main streams are string theory and loop quantum gravity and of which dont think they correspond with reality but that aside is there something more exotic or was dirac just wrong by assuming that the procedure is just stop gap procedure
375904 im starting to study information theory and the concept of entropy is not clear to me have already checked other posts in this category but none of them seems to answer my indagations so have some questions is the shannon entropy equivalent to the thermodynamics entropy have read both answers yes and no and could not understand yet many people say yes but the shannon entropy is related to symbols and the thermodynamic entropy is related to micro states and these are related to temperature and shannon entropy couldnt care less about temperature however the gibbs entropy formula is exactly the same to shannon entropy then could not form consensus in my head about the topic what exactly is the difference between boltzmann shannon gibbs and von neumann concepts of entropy have read in one topic here that shannon entropy measures the minimum amount of yes no questions to fully specify system but how does physical system could obey this for example if the entropy of volume of gas is what questions could make to fully specify this gas if these entropies are related how could convert thermodynamic unit to bit shannon unit and if one use ln instead of log the unit would be nats understand that information is way to measure differences between things and is clear to me that bit is the minimum amount of information once it distinguish between things but what would nat measure in this case if bit distinguishes between things nat would distinguish between things cant understand that ive already searched in many books and sites and questioned my professor but still dont have clue in this topics so any hint will be much apreciated
376161 in nuclear fusion the goal is to create and sustain usually with magnetic fields high temperature and high pressure environment enough to output more energy than put in tokamaks donut shape have been the topology of choice for many years however it is very difficult to keep the plasma confined within the walls because of its high surface area especially in the inner rings why hasnt anyone used spherical magnetic confinement instead to mimic stars topology due to gravity apart from general fusion injecting hydrogen into magnetically confined spherical space and letting out the fused energy once critical stage has been reached
376501 understand that when have two separate states that their combination state increases the hilbert space to psi rangle otimes psi rangle for example looking at simple example where we are considering two possible states this can be expanded to rangle rangle otimesc rangle rangle this can be then be written as ac rangle rangle ad rangle rangle bc rangle rangle bd rangle rangle frac now entanglement is defined as when we get something different than this we have entanglement when the state can not be written as simply kroniker product of any superposition state of its component states psi neq psi rangle otimes psi rangle there are number of different procedures for checking if given state is entangeled but how are entanglement states created in the first place im looking for examples of entanglement in which the mechanism that creates the entanglement is explicit the only example can think of is hong ou mendel interference creating noon states like rangle rangle get that generally identical possible outcomes can sometimes destructively interfere but im looking for something little bit more clear generally in particular id like to build some intuition so that when see am looking at given physical system ill have an idea if entanglement could be generated

376866 while reading the article the lessons of leonardo how to be creative genius in the wall street journal came across century old question than leonardo da vinci wrote in his notebook the question was why is the fish in the water swifter than the bird in the air when it ought to be the contrary since the water is heavier and thicker than the air pondered while on this question indeed water is denser than air what thought was that the fish might have travelled along the water currents to move about but cant the same apply to birds travelling with the winds does anyone have more detailed understanding to this question
377212 recently read up on spacecrafts entering earth using heat shield however when exiting the earths atmosphere it does not heat up so it does not need heat shield at that point of time yet why is this so know then when entering earth the spacecraft will heat up due to various forces like gravity drag and friction acting upon it thus causing it to heat up this is the reason why spacecraft entering earths atmosphere would need heat shield why wouldnt an exiting spacecraft experience this too any help would be appreciated
377352 from the principle of least or stationary action we get that classical system will evolve according to euler lagrange equations frac dt bigg frac partial partial dot bigg frac partial partial have often read and heard from physicists that this differential equation encapsulates all of classical mechanics glorious reformation of newtons laws that are more general compact and much more efficient get that if you plug in the value of the lagrangian you re obtain newtons second law but newtonian mechanics is based on laws is it not the law of inertia is special consequence of the second law so we dont need that but what about the third law namely that forces acts in pairs action equals minus reaction my question is can we obtain newtons third law from this form of euler lagrange equation understand that newtons third law for an isolated body system follows from total momentum conservation but what about system with geq particles if not why do people say that its all of classical mechanics in nutshell
377382 complete beginner on the physics of heat absorption loss so bear with me when make hot beverage it starts out hot but then gradually cools down as it loses heat however it eventually stops cooling down or else it would reach the impossible temperature of absolute zero my question is why do objects stop losing heat my best guess is that it enters into type of chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere am thinking along the correct lines here
377599 if take periodic wavefunction psi left vec right and then take the fourier space dispersion of the wave function as defined below psi vec iiint infty infty psi left vec righte vec cdot vec mathrm vec is there reason for calling psi vec the momentum space representation of the wavefunction understand the fact that the vector space vec gets quantized in accordance to the formulation vec cdot vec pi where in vec is the lattice translation vector periodicity of psi vec in crystal lattice but is there some other reason for calling it momentum space
377926 im working through chapter about forces and was wondering about the definition of gravitational force of which things of mass are brought together when thinking about the solar system this feels some kind of intuitive to imagine the gravitational idea but it makes me curious if this would also work in smaller version would it be possible to build tiny model of the solar system made by bowling ball and tennis ball keeping the proportion in radius and mass of the objects at some place somewhere in the universe and would be it be further possible to stick an extremely tiny object on the bowling ball and it would stay there just by the gravitation of the bowling ball of course know there would occur problems to install this model since every tool and the person itself would come up with gravitational forces ruining the model as well as there mustnt be any object of mass somewhere next to my model hope this one doesnt sound silly since this is rather elementary question but was curious
378312 recently came across this website john massis here pulled tons about 8kg of heavy train for meters using his teeth biting onto rope that connected him and the train even weight lifter cannot carry something so heavy how was this even possible would think newtons second law might apply here but am still unsure how he managed to accomplish such feat in addition he also managed to prevent helicopters and motorcycles from taking off how is that possible
378506 ive been reflecting on whether we want nuclear at all in the long term compared to renewables like wind solar and hydro theres certain amount of heat energy entering our planet and leaving it greenhouse gases reduce the amount leaving causing the planet to warm up nuclear power increases the input because its energy that would not be released here without us but the question to ask is whats the significance of the energy input from nuclear power say for example that future society becomes fully powered on fusion reactors the energy input from these reactors would be roughly joules year approx times world energy consumption we can compare to the total energy input from the sun which is joules year from these numbers the input from nuclear would be about the total solar input is that enough to cause disturbance to the energy balance of our planet and to worsen any global warming symptoms
378647 when turn on heater its supposed to be roughly efficient so it converts electricity to heat with great efficiency but why cant we do the reverse generate electricity by absorbing heat have been searching the internet and from what have read it seems completely pointless because it is so inefficient like ridiculously inefficient as in efficient so why cant we do the reverse get that energy is lost when converting from one form of energy to another but how can we get such great efficiency going from one form but have horrid efficiency going back also read online that one way to cool the earth down could be to radiate the heat off the planet anyways sorry about my mini debate can anyone answer how we could potentially cool the earth because to me it would seem funny if we couldnt and if we could then global warming wouldnt be as bad of thing as it is now would it
378837 the term pomeron was apparently important in the early stages of qcd cant find any reference to it in modern qft books but older resources sometimes refer to it offhand and ive yet to find any explanation of what it actually is old theoretical sources such as this throw up wall of math and seem to say that pomeron is purely mathematical object whose meaning is not clear to me the formal definition of reggeon is the pole in the partial wave in channel of the scattering process pomeron is reggeon with the intercept close to hard pomeron is substitute for the following sentence the asymptotic for the cross section at high energy for the hard processes which occur at small distances of the order of where is the largest transverse momentum scale in the process but old experimental sources say that the pomeron is particle and that its exchange explains some features of hadron scattering cross sections that mismatch confuses me but wikipedia goes even further and says the pomeron has been found by the 1990s the existence of the pomeron as well as some of its properties were experimentally well established notably at fermilab and desy the pomeron carries no charges the absence of electric charge implies that pomeron exchange does not lead to the usual shower of cherenkov radiation while the absence of color charge implies that such events do not radiate pions this makes me really confused if the pomeron has been found how come no modern sources ever talk about it is it some other particle glueball or meson maybe under different name or have pomerons been ruled out are the cross sections they were invented to explain now well understood if not why does nobody talk about pomerons anymore edit after searching around some more im getting the impression that the pomeron is an effective particle the result of the exchange of one of whole infinite family of particles that lie on particular regge trajectory but what really mystifies me is that every source steadfastly refuses to say what those particles are their quark and gluon content this is apparently part of the spirit of the bootstrap program where such questions are just not allowed to be asked but shouldnt we be able to understand this in conventional qcd
378865 consider the following problem consider plane with uniform charge density sigma above the said plane there is system of conducting wires made up of an shaped circuit on which linear conductor of lenght can slide with constant velocity the system as whole has rectangular shape and is parallel to the plane see the picture calculate the line integral of the magnetic field bf along the perimeter lt of said rectangle as function of time my professor solves this problem using maxwells fourth equation in integral form assuming that the current density bf is everywhere null and that the electric field bf is the one generated by uniformly charged plane perpendicular to the the plane and of norm frac sigma epsilon thus yielding oint lt bf cdot dl mu epsilon frac dt int st bf cdot ds mu epsilon 0edv mu sigma dv think there are some things wrong both with this solution there should be no magnetic field at all uniformly charged plane only produces an electrostatic field know there could be magnetic field generated by the current inside the wires but then you couldnt assume that bf is null everywhere as my professor did maxwells fourth equation does not hold in that form if the domains of integration are allowed to vary with time in fact by resorting to the differential forms we find that plugging bf vec and frac partial bf partial as my professor assumed yields rot bf and thus the line integral of the magnetic field over any closed curve at any istant should be zero by stokes theorem therefore my question is the following are the my professors assumption bf vec frac partial bf partial vec correct or do both bf and bf need be modified so as to account for the charges present in the circuit is there current in the circuit at all

379193 from what can tell if you pick color near the extreme of the visible light spectrum lets say red and trace path across the spectrum until you are outside of the visible range at some point the red color will begin to darken and dim until its invisible ie black indicating that you are now outside the range if this is the case does that mean that if you were to observe powerful enough light source emitting solely that dim frequency that it could be blinding to your eyes by blinding dont think mean literally blocking the rest of your vision but more as in painful or overly stimulating the same way bright white or bright blue light can affect persons sight it is hard to imagine being blinded by dim light because usually when you increase the intensity of the light the saturation of the color will increase until it appears bright in this special case though the color is already fully saturated to begin with so no matter how high you increased the intensity it will always appear dim is this right edit comments have shown that the word was searching for is dazzled not blinded there are some great answers here explaining the harmful effects of this type of light and this is legitimate interpretation of what am looking for the essence of the question however is to understand if near ir or near uv light could have dazzling effect on the observers eyes
379280 is there anything preventing the following experiment from being done right now imagine that human ran from point to point while light particles that reflected off clock moved through special medium from point to point as well could human arrive at point before light as for the special medium im imagining something like complex maze of mirrors submerged in very dense material if so if the human waited at the finish line to view light arriving in second place would they see the time that the race began on the clock
379482 in the night when look at distant light source for example street lamp few hundred meters away do not simply see spot but rather spot which is surrounded by light beams so instead of seeing the image on the left hand side of the picture below see the one on the right hand side know similar effect also comes up by using camera lenses even though am not sure if the reason is exactly the same below for example is picture with four beams source https astromallorca org astrofotografias dsc so why do see with my own eyes three beams whereas with camera there appear to be more
379892 im going through physics with my 5th grade child there is question and answer that indicates that airborne ball at the top of the trajectory does not have kinetic energy the diagram below shows the path taken by ball after it was kicked the ball hit the ground initially at and eventually stopped moving at at which positions did the ball have no kinetic energy only and only and only and only this is the explanation given in the book answer and only at and the ball had both kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy at the maximum height at the ball had only gravitational potential energy but no kinetic energy at the ball had kinetic energy but no gravitational potential energy as it was at the ground level at the ball stopped moving so it had no kinetic energy the ball also had not gravitationa potential energy as it was at ground level ignoring the complicated fact that anything with heat has kinetic energy internally is there some reason the ball wouldnt continue to have kinetic energy there is no longer vertical motion but it is still in forward motion
379993 to correctly calculate scattering amplitudes in nonabelian gauge theory one must include feynman diagrams with internal faddeev popov ghosts fictitious fermionic scalars that only appear internally in loop diagrams not as external legs ive seen many different talks by high energy experimentalists and particle phenomenologists which have included plenty of complicated loop feynman diagrams involving strong and weak interaction scattering processes here and here but ive never ever seen any experimentalist ever show feynman diagram containing an internal fp ghost propagator why can they get away with neglecting the fp ghosts
380073 trying to non technically explain why kinetic energy goes as rather then the perhaps more intuitive double the speed double the energy ended up putting my foot in my mouth itself difficult physical manipulation by proving precisely what didnt want to prove as follows suppose you get an object moving to speed thatll require some amount of energy which well just call we wont need to bother calculating it now to somebody else moving alongside that object it seems to be stationary so he can get it moving at relative to himself with the same energy that you used to get it moving at relative to yourself so the total energy used is 2e first to get it moving from to relative to you and then to get it moving from to relative to that other guy but now its moving at 2v relative to you and the total energy used is 2e rather than the known right answer 4e so whats wrong im guessing its somehow got to involve those two different lab frames for example maybe whatever apparatus the second guy used in his frame first had to acquire its relative to your original frame and that required some energy but even so why exactly an extra 2e to make up the missing difference so that cant be precisely the arguments error but its the two frames somehow right or what edit this is an extended reply to stephengs comment under philipwoods answer below stephen sure energys common sense concept everything in physics is must be common sense if you can get to the underlying intuition and after failing miserably with my above described argument came up with more successful attempt described below just to prove my point that it ultimately must be common sense this arguments bit more elaborate and id like to come up with correct simpler one but at least this argument gets the correct result suppose youre hit with ball going at speed and then with an identical ball going at speed 2v so how much harder does the 2v ball hit you to answer that suppose the balls are made up of lots and lots of closely packed identical little particles all moving side by side together then each little 2v particle carries twice the punch of particle punch here is of course momentum not energy but just said punch to avoid introducing big words and unnecessary technicalities however since the 2v particles are travelling twice as fast then in say one second twice as many of them will hit you therefore youll be hit with twice as many particles each carrying twice the punch so your total punch will be four times as great not two times okay so this argument involves time and therefore power rather than energy so its not entirely achieving its purpose but since this was non technical discussion simply didnt bother mentioning my misgivings about it good enough for the time being figured but to elaborate my original question can you make air tight the above argument and maybe explain whats wrong with the original one hopefully so that its correct and even simpler than this one
380155 in childrens museum ran across this fountain you can adjust the flow rate with valve visible at the bottom at low flow rates the sheet of water does more or less what youd expect it curves downward eventually falling more or less vertically when you increase the flow rate surprising thing happens the sheet of water curls back in toward the center what causes this whatever it is it seems that it must overcome the additional outward momentum of the water and then some it is hard for me to believe that it is result of surface tension for this reason why should surface tension be so much stronger at the higher flow rate is it an aerodynamic effect did brief internet search and didnt find anything
380352 in the book mathematical physics by balakrishnan he says on page that the isomorphism between rm so and mathbb mathbb and the fact that mathbb is the universal covering group of rm so has deep implications in two dimensional systems in condensed matter physics and quantum field theory without any further explanation can someone elaborate on what he might have in mind
380415 quantum mechanics is near universally considered one of the most difficult concepts to grasp but what were the persistently unintuitive conceptually challenging fields physicists had to grasp before the emergence of quantum mechanics the aim of asking this is mainly to gain insight on how one may approach subject as unintuitive as quantum mechanics
380487 the earth is km away from the sun and the speed of light is kilometres second therefore it would take sunlight on average minutes and seconds to reach earth now imagine the following scenario which think we can all relate to you are at the beach and the sun is shining what wonderful day but no suddenly clouds appear and bye bye good time because the sun gets in the clouds some time passes and you can see the sun coming out of the clouds and the second this happens you feel the warm embrace of our extraordinary favourite star my question is from what said in the beginning sunlight travels to earth in minutes and seconds however we immediately feel it when the sun gets out of the clouds why is that because from what can see it should take minutes and seconds
380748 when am heating water on gas stove it begins to boil after some time and bubbles of air can be seen escaping out however as soon as increase the amount of heat in the stove the rate of escape of air bubbles increases immediately and as soon as turn off the stove the air bubbles stop coming out right then in this case am boiling water in steel utensil steel is good conductor of heat then why does this change take place so quickly with the change in heat

380892 in the proof of the relation 5c degrees celsius to fahrenheit we assume that there is straight line linear relation between the two temperature scales mc then we need two points to find the equation for that line how can we explain to student the very form linear of the relation among these temperature scales or between kelvin and degrees celcius rankine and degrees fahrenheit as well as kelvin and rankine
381492 consider this setup to study conservation of energy it is usually taught that the potential energy at any point on this roller coaster is given by mgh where is the height above the ground but the gravity is not the only force here there is friction due to the the surface of the roller coaster then there is air resistance and finally the normal force to the surface of the roller coaster the one that keeps it from falling down we can neglect friction and air resistance to make the problem simpler but how can we neglect the normal force am clearly missing something can someone help
381550 according to the national radio astronomy observatory the rm cm line of hydrogen can be emitted by the neutral hydrogen atom due to the magnetic interaction between the spins of the proton and electron however it says the hydrogen molecule rm does not posses permanent dipole and thus does not emit spectral line at radio frequencies why is that the interaction between the spins of the proton and electrons no longer manifests itself when we are talking about the rm molecule
381625 in their book introduction to quantum field theory peskin and schroeder talk about trick to form the generators for the lorentz group from the commutators of the gamma matrices using their anti commutation relations using the anti commutation relations gamma mu gamma nu mu nu times mathbf times the generators of the lorentz group are formed as mu nu frac big gamma mu gamma nu big this can be seen as the general case of set of basis vectors here the matrices corresponding to the multiples of the gamma matrices which form clifford algebra of mathcal pq and whose commutators form generators of lie group lorentz group here which conserves the quadratic form of the clifford algebra itself is there way to formalize this idea want to know if we take any arbitrary metric mu nu on some space will the generators defined as mu nu generate lie group whose elements are transformations on that conserve the inner product corresponding to the metric
381828 towels and coats are often stored on hooks like this to the untrained eye it looks like the towel will slide off from its own weight the hook usually angles upwards slightly but towel does not have any handle to string around and hang on to the hook this makes it seem like it will simply slide off yet these hooks hold towels well even heavy bath towels why have three ideas there is sufficient friction between the towel and the hook to counteract the force of the towel pulling down the hook is angled such that the force is directed into the hook not directed to slide the towel off of it the center of mass of the towel ends up below the hook since the towel is hanging against the wall which of these ideas are likely correct am also happy with an answer based purely on theoretical analysis of the forces involved
381981 if water vapor is pulled inwards and cooled at fast enough rate could if be frozen back into solid form understand that they would have to be froze together as soon as contact is made but if this is possible what would the temperature have to be and could this be the only thing that can directly go from gas to solid
382128 the lhc is much larger than its predecessors and proposed successors much larger still today particle accelerators seem to be the main source of new discoveries about the fundamental nature of the world my lay interpretation is that particle accelerators like the lhc are essentially the only viable apparatus for performing experiments in particle physics passive detectors of naturally energized particles notwithstanding experiments vary by configuration sensors and source material but the need for an accelerator is constant and more powerful accelerators are able to perform experiments which are out of reach to less powerful accelerators for the most powerful accelerators more powerful seems to imply physically larger in these ring shaped accelerators for given type of particle its maximum power appears to be very roughly proportionate to circumference use the word power in loose sense here reflecting my loose grasp of its meaning technology upgrades can make an accelerator more powerful without making it larger the planned high luminosity upgrade to the lhc one imagines that an upgrade would be cheaper to build than colossal new accelerator yet larger accelerators are still built so it would seem to follow that the upgrade potential of given accelerator is limited in some way that there is in fact relationship between the size of an accelerator and its maximum power the first part of my question is this what is the nature of the relationship between the size and power of modern particle accelerator are there diminishing returns to the operating cost of making an accelerator more powerful or are there fundamental physical constraints placing hard limit on how powerful an accelerator of given size can be or is technology the main limiting factor is it conceivable that orders of magnitude power increases could be efficiently achieved in small accelerator with more advanced technology is it likely the basic premise of these experiments seems to be that we observe the collision byproducts of energetic particles where energetic presumably refers to kinetic energy since we used an accelerator to energize them to create interesting collision byproducts the kinetic energy in the collision measured in ev must be at least as large as the mass of the particle also measured in ev we wish to create thus we can observe particles of higher mass with higher powered accelerator the second part of my question is this are particle accelerators the only way of pushing the boundaries of experimental particle physics is it conceivable that there is way to produce these interesting byproducts in an experimental setting without using high energy collisions if not is it conceivable that there is way to energize particles other than by accelerating them around track if not is it impossible by definition or for some physical reason if either of these alternatives are conceivable then assuming theyre not practical replacements for large accelerators today is it possible that they will be in the future is it likely in sentence my question is this is the future of experimental particle physics now just matter of building larger and larger particle accelerators
382429 in concerts when the audience sing it sounds almost okay not out of tune as if they sing all harmonious however if small group of people sing we can notice the off tune singing is it simply related to the average value of the sound waves or does it have special name hope made myself clear with the question
382667 this might be stupid question but could not find the answer in my textbook or on the internet with few searches so believe when an atomic electron moves down to lower energy level it emits radiation in the process however since the energy levels are discrete the photons released have specific energies and hence wavelength which results in the line spectra however apparently this is only true for hot gases and not liquids or solids which have continous emission spectrum why is this
382704 so have read lot about quantum fluctuations and how they are responsible for lamb shift spontaneous emission of photons from excited atomic states casimir effect and the explanation always mentions either or both of these two things being the energy langle rangle but langle rangle neq because of the delta delta hbar uncertainty principle so actually there is some temporal appearance of energy the vacuum is full of pairs of virtual particles and antiparticles annihilating each other and for time delta dictated by the above uncertainty principle they can interat with real particles now fall in the line of though that delta delta hbar is not real uncertainty principle as is not an operator this expression is derived from ehrenfest theorem and quantifies the maximum change that the energy eigenvalue can undergo in an interval delta virtual particles do not exist they are just an artefact of perturbative expansions is there physical qft free qualitative way to understand quantum fluctuations and in order to make sense of the very real phenomena associated with them like the ones listed at the beginning is there relation to the ground state energy problem leading to the cosmological constant problem
382736 firstly know that the equation for the escape velocity is text escape sqrt frac gm tag and understand its derivation the following is such simple derivation for test body of mass in orbit with massive body assumed to be spherical with mass and separation between the two bodys centres equating the centripetal force to the gravitational force yields frac mv frac gmm tag which on simplificaton gives sqrt frac gm tag what would like to know is why eqn is not valid escape velocity equation or put in another way mathematically the derivation in seems sound yet it is out by factor of sqrt what is missing from the derivation edit as mentioned in the comment below just to be clear understand that equation will give the velocity required for bound circular orbit but to escape it should follow that the test mass has to move at any speed that is infinitesimally larger than sqrt frac gm such that text escape from orbit gt sqrt frac gm so in other words eqn gives the smallest possible speed for bound circular orbit referred to this as the escape speed since speeds larger than this will lead to non circular orbit and larger still will lead to an escape from the elliptical orbit so my final question is do the formulas and actually give the highest possible speed not to escape orbit rather than the escape speed itself thank you to all those that contributed these answers
382849 during course took on general relativity the professor started with an introduction on differential geometry vectors were properly motivated he said that since the differential manifold doesnt have distances it didnt make sense to define vectors as the displacement between two points we had to use something infinitesimal instead then he gave several advantages for using derivatives as vectors instead of the classic euclidean two point arrows however when he starting explaining forms he just said what they were and move on dont really understand why we need forms also dont know if forms are also generalization of an euclidean concept such as vectors ive read many questions about forms but none of them asked about clear motivation for introducing them in general relativity course so thats the question what is the motivation for using forms in general relativity what do they are useful for cant we just use vectors and then introduce metric to have direct product note have checked many books looking for proper motivation but just find the definition followed by the usual interpretation of forms as perpendicular planes in space ive read gravitation carrols book and schutz both books to be clear dont need physical explanation what want is motivation for using forms when we can just use the metric and two vectors if we want inner product
383704 general relativity predicts the bending of light due to gravity but does this explanation require light to be corpuscular can the em waves of classical electromagnetism be bend in einsteins gravity or does the fact that light bends due to gravity alone prove that it is photonscorpuscles in general relativity
384187 was in conversation with my senior engineer where he kept on insisting that we can use plural when we write down any unit argued that it is not the common practice or even throughout my whole academic career unfortunately havent found any instance where there was any plural unit used in the text books he argued that if said that it was not correct then it should have good reason for that when searched for this topic couldnt come to any conclusive decision such as this thread and the other links those have been referred there some leads to english se these answers gave me the impression that it is grammatically acceptable provided the right circumstances but felt that it would be rather ambiguous to accept plurals on scientific and engineering notations for example we were talking about output rate of boiler which is measured in mathrm kg hr my senior said that it is okay if anyone writes mathrm kgs hr to me it looks ambiguous if anyone writes mathrm after mathrm kg it may give plural sense but as well it may refer to second also moreover if anyone argues that this is acceptable in some cases like mathrm kgs hr then what would be the yard stick to find out accepted cases for instance can we add mathrm in mathrm or mathrm km hr like mathrm ms or mathrm kms hr there is the nist guide for the use of the international system of units which has this example the length of the laser is mathrm but not the length of the laser is five meters but want to have more conclusive answer to which one is acceptable mathrm kg hr or mathrm kgs hr or other similar instances
384241 neutral hydrogen atom is composed of proton and an electron the overall charge on the atom is zero but there are local charges within the atom as the negative and positive charge is not evenly distributed if neutral hydrogen atom were placed in an electric field the electron and the proton would experience force in opposite directions could strong enough electric field tear the electron and proton apart
385085 am having trouble finding the eigenvalues for the hamiltonian frac 2m frac 2m frac frac even though can find basis where the and coordinates are decoupled then get products of momenta in my new hamiltonian think this problem should be transformable into two decoupled oscillators am wrong about that
385298 my kitchen clock has pendulum which is just for decoration and is not powering the clock the pendulums arm has magnet that is repelled by second magnet that is fixed to the clocks body the repelling magnets are at their closest when the pendulum is at its lowest point we all hopefully agree that regular pendulum would eventually slow down due to friction but honestly cannot recall ever seeing the clocks pendulum at rest by my calculations the magnet would slow the pendulum as it falls but accelerate it as it swings up the other side so how would magnet actually create any net benefit to the pendulum will the pendulum eventually stop or if not how is it not violating the laws of thermodynamics

385810 cook frequently with aluminum foil as cover in the oven when its time to remove the foil and cook uncovered find can handle it with my bare hands and its barely warm what are the physics for this does it have something to do with the thickness and storing energy
385862 in my textbook there is written that done work spent energy suppose am riding motorcycle start my journey from place and then going to various places come back to the exact pointi never stopped in my journey so my displacement is and the work done by me is also but in my journey have combusted fuel and spent energy and that energy is not so is my textbook wrong or am wrong
386126 recently wrote an answer on question and would infer from the responses that there is not widespread awareness of the context of the development of qm and its various interpretations instead the physics community has attempted to settle broadly on copenhagen interpretation that many people find totally unsatisfactory despite its internal popularity in physics and widespread teaching to new entrants to the field since the matter is fresh in my mind happen to have stumbled upon few relatively recent articles from physicist called freire who remarks on the general cultural attitude of the physics community in the latter 20th century in relation to qm he also discusses specifically the treatment of david bohm by american academia and why his work has been neglected in physics sci ed eprint and hist stud phys biol sci arxiv physics my question is is anyone aware of other good sources that discuss the interpretational problem in qm and how the very question has been treated in physics im only asking for sources
386221 would like to know if there is convenient identity and what it is for langle dagger rangle where rangle rangle are energy eigenstates of simple harmonic oscillator hamiltonian and dagger are annihilation and creation operators respectively is natural number ive done problems for but its not clear to me how to generalize
386346 ive just seen this on the news single trapped atom captures science photography competitions top prize credit david nadlinger via epsrc am not physics major but believe do know the basics have always believed that we cant really see single atoms with naked eye what allows that picture to make us see single atom if that single atom is being held there by field why are the atoms of that very field not visible
386596 catenary curve is the curve followed by rope suspended at both ends in uniform gravity thought would try to solve it myself because it seemed like good challenge but almost immediately got stuck on this question given that nothing is moving we can say left right where left is the tension along the rope to the left and right is the tension along the rope to the right fine and dandy now given that the catenary curve is smooth between but not including its endpoints left should then always be colinear with right so then the direction components cancel out and the net of the direction components cancels with gravity but what about at the very lowest point on the catenary curve intuitively this should be the point where the tangent is perfectly orthogonal to gravity and as such hat right hat left hat since both left and right are orthogonal to what holds up the lowest point of rope following catenary curve
386971 know that the full moon appears when sun moon and earth are in straight line but if we consider that they are in straight line why is the moon illuminated mean to say that earth should block all the rays of the sun and shouldnt allow any light ray to reach the moon in this case the moon should not get illuminated as no light has reached it which it can reflect back then why do we see fully illuminated hemisphere of the moon
387734 recently my physics teacher during rant said something that piqued my interest heres what he said there are more problems visiting other stars if you wanted rocket to go the speed of light youd need an extreme amount of energy and the same amount of energy to also stop that rocket once you were at your destination and wanted to land safely but this seems odd to me because in this rant he was talking about the earth to alpha centauri so hes saying the amount of energy to both starts it going and stop it is the same but vacuum is frictionless and the rocket doesnt have to fight the 1g here on earth so how would they have the same energy total one thought had is that using the gravity of earth as slingshot might make up for having to fight earth gravity and air resistance my specific question is is he right and if he is why math up to pre calc is fine
388069 after reading parts of chapter in hobson general relativity an introduction for physicists have question regarding the observation on page regarding the gravitational field equations in empty space we see that in empty space the field equations reduce to mu nu table is given begin array hline text of spacetime dimensions text of field equations text indep components of mu nu sigma rho hline hline end array then it states thus we see that in two or three dimensions the field equations in empty space guarantee that the full curvature tensor must vanish in four dimensions however it is therefore possible to satisfy the field equations in empty space with non vanishing curvature tensor we conclude that it is only in four dimensions or more that gravitational fields can exist in empty space find this confusing because surely empty space means no matter or energy now if the underline text curvature of spacetime is related to the underline text matter and energy density then how is it possible that in dimensions there can be non zero curvature tensor surely regardless of the mathematics in empty space it should still be forced zero by the fact that nothing is there forgive me if my question sounds naive for am only covering the derivation of the gravitational field equations now for the first time ref hobson efstathiou lasenby general relativity an introduction for physicists cambridge cambridge university press
388164 in atomic bombs nuclear reactions provide the energy of the explosion in every reaction thermal neutron reaches plutonium or uranium nucleus fission reaction takes place and two or three neutrons and gamma radiation are produced know that it happens in very short time and an extreme amount of energy is released which can be calculated from the mass difference between mathrm starting and mathrm reaction products so my question is why exactly does it explode what causes the shockwave and why is it so powerful here mean the pure shockwave which is not reflected from surface yet understand the reactions which are taking place in nuclear bombs but dont understand why exactly it leads to powerful explosion instead of just burst of ionising radiation
388700 am just starting to wrap my head around analytical mechanics so this question might sound weird or trivial to some of you in class have been introduced to noethers theorem which states that if the lagrangian function is invariant under continuous group of transformations then its possible to find conservation law but lagrangian system with degrees of freedom obeys the euler lagrange equations which are frac dt frac partial partial dot frac partial partial for this equation represents system of second order differential equations that already has 2n arbitrary constants in its general solution this constants are obviously to be preserved in time so they actually represent conservation laws so my question is what is the utility of theorem that tells you under what conditions it is possible to find conservation law if we already know from the euler lagrange equations that lagrangian system has 2n conservation laws
388744 had always thought anything below third dimensions couldnt exist in our 3rd dimensional world correct me if im wrong but anything 0d 1d or 2d is massless and also cant have energy so it just cant exist however shadow is the lack of information lack of photons to be exact so they have no energy no mass but still show an object so my exact question is shadow actually two dimensional would the surface you cast the shadow onto have to be perfectly flat
388776 black body absorbs all energy it doesnt reflect or transmit energy it also absorbs all light and doesnt reflect any light why then can we see it for instance burnt platinum is black body and yet is visible
388802 this question is based on discussion with year old so if it is not clear how to interpret certain details imagine how year old would interpret them this year old does not know about relativistic issues so assume that we are living in newtonian universe in this model our universe is homogenous and isotropic with properties such as we see around us specifically the density and size distribution of stars is what the current models say they are this universe has the same size as our observable universe around billion light years if we froze time and took plane through this universe would this plane go through star cannot figure out if the chance of this happening is close to zero or close to one know that distances between stars are very big so the plane is much more likely to be outside star than inside star so my intuition wants to say that the chance is very small but on the other hand this plane will be very big so based on that my intuition says that the chance is close to one expect the chance to be one of these extremes would be very surprised if the chance were close to clearly my intuition fails here and dont know how to approach this problem better generating entire universes of stars and calculating if plane intersects one of the stars takes too much time rough estimates are perfectly acceptable only want to know if the chance is close to zero or close to one edit reading the comments answers noticed that my reference to the year old did not have the intended effect some of the answers comments focussed on how an answer to the title question could be explained to year old that was not my question and was bit surprised to see several people interpreting it that way my question is the one summarized in the title and some of the comments were about the definition of observable universe and that it necessarily would slice through earth because earth is in the center of our observable universe added the reference of the year old to avoid such loopholes rob jeffries and accumulations interpretation of the question was exactly what meant so their answers satisfied me
389168 like many people have tried burning stuff with magnifying glass where live the power of sun is some watts per square meter at most if my magnifying glass is 10cm in diameter have only watts on my focus point it can light paper instantly this makes me wonder why do we have laser cutters few hundred watts of ordinary light could do the same it would seem much easier to have just ordinary light source no expensive co2 or fiber lasers just simple high power led for example guess that the reason is that laser light is coherent another thing that comes to my mind is that sunligt is practically collimated as the sun is so far maybe achieving same with artificial light is not so easy what is the real reason
389213 just want to know how does an electron felt the presence of positron before they are converted into energy also how does the electron tell if it is positron or proton if this makes any difference
389214 the question of how receiving antenna works has been asked on this site before such as here how does receiving antenna get an induced electric current and here how does receiving antenna work understand the basic principle that the external em field from the transmitting antenna causes electrons to move in the receiving antenna creating current my question though is in the title how can an external electric field as in the form of radio or other em wave induce current in wire when the field is always zero in there in terms of physical laws and math how can calculate the current as function of time if know the external fields as function of time wanted to try to calculate the potential difference between two points of wire from the external field using varepsilon int text start point text end point mathbf cdot text mathbf but that assumes that the electric field in the wire is as it would be if the wire werent there and the waves were propagating through vacuum

389590 it is obvious that the motion of an object is resisted by air resistance both in the horizontal and vertical components however what fail to understand is that the projectile of an object with air resistance taken into account is not parabolic and instead is steeper on its way down than it is on its way up why is this
389698 for the purposes of science fiction story where the author is attempting to have as much basis in fact as possible if one were to create or make use of morris thorne or similar traversable wormhole and accelerate one end to modify it to be time machine would one simply be able to step through would the transition in theory be safe or deadly would some kind of life support gear be in order would this apply also if one stepped back to the younger end from the point of view of the person travelling through for the purposes of this im assuming that both ends of the wormhole are on the earths surface and at points in time where the atmospheric surface etc conditions are suitable for human to live normally apologise if this should be in the science fiction site but wish to look at this from the point of view of scientist with the sense of wonder of say hawking any information and thoughts on this would be amazingly helpful edit dont feel this question is duplicate of the question would there be forces acting on body as it traverses space near wormhole as seek to understand the effects of passing through the wormhole to humans life and health by stepping through not an ambiguous body in space
389947 my friends year old daughter asked why are there circles there it had either rained the night before or frost had thawed what explains the circles follow up question ideally are these really circles or some kind of superellipse
389964 today was watching video on youtube where saw lines representing the light of light source while the image was downscaled like this there were some clear patterns on the horizontal and vertical lines going through the source already saw this phenomenon few times when received photos of computer monitors when there were some closely packed lines saw patterns resembling those in the screenshot when was playing around with she scale of the image as was increasing or decreasing the size of the image the pattern was changing continuously this is what the actual image looks like when it isnt scaled down the patterns seem to disappear what causes this phenomenon assumed it was falling under the category optics if am false am sorry source of the video https www youtube com watchv o3eb9sfls
390230 imagine electrons being accelerated by passing gravitational waves say from nearby kilonova so would expect the electrons to emit light am right
390383 wanted to pose question here also posted to physics bit earlier and was hoping the you all might be able to help was re reading book by the philosopher hilary putnam titled naturalism realism and normativity and came across footnote within chapter that focused on semantics to give some clarity will quote the context within the chapter and then cite the footnote immediately below that where there is emphasis in the original text it is putnams of course there are natural kinds that we are all pretty good at identifying without relying on experts for example water but it would be wrong to think that the extension of the word water is fixed simply by the superficial properties of water that is that water means liquid that quenches thirst has such and such taste and so on and it would be equally mistaken to say that water means def rm 2o it is true that most educated people now know or think they know that is the chemical formula for water but educated speakers and uneducated speakers do not speak different languages moreover water is is not precisely true21 water has the same meaning in the mouth of an english speaking scientific ignoramus and the mouth of an english speaking chemist they both know the meaning of water in english in the sense of possessing the sort of linguistic competence that every person who masters the language is linguistically obliged to have connection with that word they refer to the same liquid when they use the word and the footnote normal water is actually quantum mechanical superposition of rm 4o rm 6o very little if any water is simply now just want to be clear that my question relates to the footnote that seems to promote the idea that every water molecule or any other molecule is in superposition state that consists of integer multiples of the base molecular formula that we know going to infinity do not mean that water itself can very likely be composed of many different isotopes of hydrogen including deuterium and tritium and oxygen which is tackled pretty cogently in this essay ive scoured the internet looking for other references to this with no luck feel like my handle on physics concepts is decently advanced and ive read enough about superposition to at least think would have run across the concept couched in terms similar to those putnam would make would have reached out to ask him myself but unfortunately he passed away shortly after the book was published have massive respect for him as philosopher so im going to give him the benefit of the doubt on this but could anyone here point me in the right direction as to whether he is actually correct or whether he may have misspoken or taken some liberty here any help is greatly appreciated as im sure many of you know an understanding of how the words and symbols we use come to acquire their meaning whether through reference correspondence with something out there in reality common usage in community of speakers etc is one of the most important questions asked in philosophy
390456 there is this question in my physics book and two teachers private teacher of friend of mine and the school teacher say that its step down transformer while two other teachers say that its niether of them since transformers type is only determined by the number of turns dont really know which one is correct and why so if someone could explain id appreciate it
391488 microscopically the pressure exerted by fluid on surface in contact with it is caused by collisions of molecules of fluid with the surface as result of collision the component of molecules momentum perpendicular to the surface is reversed the surface must exert an impulsive force on the molecule and by newtons third law the molecule exerts an equal force perpendicular to the surface the net result of reaction force exerted by many molecules on the surface gives rise to the pressure on the surface the above is an extract from physics by resnick halliday krane ive few questions conceptual in nature which stemmed from the above paragraph all that is mentioned is that the component of molecules momentum perpendicular to surface is reversed nothing is mentioned about its magnitude if they wish to tell us that the collision is elastic as in the case of kinetic theory of gases why is this valid assumption maybe the right question to ask is to what extent is it valid assumption according to the aforementioned extract pressure arises due to collisions between molecules and the surface it is also well known fact that pressure in static fluid increases with depth how can we explain that using this collision model im confused because the nature of collisions should be property of the fluid and should not vary with depth is this model the one that talks about pressure arising due to collisions sufficient to explain pressure related phenomena in all possible situations or is it mere approximation
392272 it is well documented that given body has well defined schwarzschild radius defining minimum radius for its volume given its mass before it becomes black hole it is clearly true also that the escape velocity for black holes is greater than however would mass with an escape velocity also be black hole my belief is that such an object would be black hole or on the way to being one since such escape velocities might only be achievable in situation where mass is going to or is becoming one for example it might be the escape velocity of collapsing star my question then is what is the lower bound for the escape velocity of an object before we can know that it is or will be black hole
392508 reading through papers and online sources about radio galaxies kept stumbling across term decade of the electromagnetic spectrum radio galaxy emission encompasses decades of the em spectrum or this quote from nasa astronomers have made observations of electromagnetic radiation from cosmic sources that cover range of more than decades in wavelength or equivalently in frequency or energy source what exactly does this term correspond to note used the electromagnetism tag because of the context but am not sure if the unit can be used outside of the field feel free to edit away
392785 im reading the following post to learn about qcd interactions why are colors used in qcd however cant seem to grasp the conceptual difference between the dimension of group and the dimension of its representation the information found uses representation theory formalism that dont quite understand yet what is the difference in the definition of the dimension of group and its representation and in particular why does sun symmetry corresponds to conserved charges
392863 consider simple situation like this an object is sitting on table in classical mechanics we say that the net force on the object is zero because gravity treated as force and normal reaction force are equal and opposite to each other and hence its acceleration is zero but according to einsteins general theory of relativity gravity isnt force at all but instead curvature created in spacetime by massive object and objects near it tend to move towards it because they are just moving along the geodesic paths in that curved spacetime so if an object kept on table gets acted only by the normal reaction force as gravity aint force how is the net force on it zero
393891 have noticed in many quantum optics papers that operators are written as exponentials is there reason for this beyond style or convention for example is it physically significant or more amenable to calculation if the latter what specific theorems make it better as an example in they write the controlled phase flip gate as matrix exponential pi where is projection operator the exponential of projection operator has simple taylor expansion begin align alpha hat alpha hat frac alpha hat cdots hat alpha frac alpha cdots hat alpha end align which from my understanding you would generally need to perform first in order to use the operator for calculations so why not just write it in the expanded form to begin with scalable photonic quantum computation through cavity assisted interactions duan and kimble phys rev lett arxiv quant ph
394062 this is repost of question saw here could the spacetime manifold itself end at the event horizon which was closed because it apparently didnt seem clear as to what the poster there was asking however when saw it think had fairly immediate idea of what the asker is supposed to be asking about and suspect there is valid question here however if im wrong you can close this one too namely what im asking and believe the op of that was asking as well and im more asking it to resurrect the question in better form is the series of these questions each of which builds on top of each other and it is asking in particular about the topological restrictions on spacetime manifolds in general relativity is it permissible for space time manifold in general relativity to have an edge in the same sense that piece of paper 2d manifold has an edge that is the manifold has boundary points in the sense in topology with the set of boundary points being of dimension one less than its own dimension if is the manifold then partial ne emptyset and mathrm dim partial mathrm dim if so is it permissible for it to contain hole in the same sense as if you punched hole in said sheet using hole punch this is another 2d boundary but we can enclose it with loop and perhaps higher dimensional enclosures in its higher dimensional analogue another way to say this may be that the higher dimensional boundary results in the manifold being not simply connected if that is so could the event horizon of black hole be just such boundary or connected set of boundary points of the spacetime manifold note that it appears the regular singularity of an ordinary black hole is at least from what gather in readings boundary of dimension so the question basically is if you can have boundary of dimension and thus the manifold simply stops as the sheet of paper does at its edge or better yet hole punched in it at the black holes event horizon so that the black hole is literally hole in spacetime one simplistic model of what is being asked would be just take the schwarzschild spacetime and delete the interior part no observer outside could tell the difference right so this would be consistent empirically no and anything falling in simply ceases to exist when it hits the horizon as that represents the termination of its worldline same as with the singularity but here the singularity fills the entire volume of the horizon the context seems to be quantum gravitational theories involving black hole firewall and the idea is that at least on cursory reading of some of the papers put forward suggested the firewall was just this kind of abrupt termination mathematical boundary of the manifold also note however this question is fairly old from so id also be curious in knowing if that progress on the firewall problem since then has definitively been able to rule out the idea of such space time hole and if so how exactly it did so provided that was proper characterization in the first place even modulo any connection to the firewall theories what exactly would prevent black hole from being such literal hole in space as outlined in points above
394152 im trying to understand the relationship between rotations in real space and in quantum state space let me explain with this example suppose have spin particle lets say an electron with spin measured in the direction if rotate this electron by an angle of pi to get the spin in the direction the quantum state rotates half the angle pi because of the orthogonality of the states rangle and rangle think this isnt very rigorous but is this way of seeing it correct searched for how to derive this result and started to learn about representations read about so3 and su2 and their relationship but its still unclear to me found this action of su2 on spinors omega theta hat frac theta hat cdot vec sigma where hat is unitary 3d vector vec sigma sigma sigma sigma is the pauli vector and sigma are the pauli matrices see the factor of frac on the rotation angle theta but where does it come from saw sigma sigma 2i epsilon ijk sigma and making frac sigma the commutator becomes ix epsilon ijk which is the commutator of the mathfrak so lie algebra isnt it so when compute the exponential theta hat cdot frac theta hat cdot vec sigma get my result and it seems like its rotation but read that it isnt an so3 representation so where do rotations appear however my central question is how can demonstrate that rotation on our world generates rotation of quantum states and how do use that to show the formula for rotations on quantum states and how do it for higher spin values im really new on this topic and it was hard to formulate this question so feel free to ask me for better explanation or to clear any misconception
394942 heres gif showing how the balls move when move the rattle the circular tube hangs vertically with the balls on the bottom there are more images in the bottom the balls roll freely inside the tube the inner diameter of the tube is larger than the diameter of the balls have tried taking an external magnet close to it but the balls arent affected by it what makes these balls repel each other assuming its magnetism why dont the poles just align and attract each other instead of repelling they could still align like this if there were more than two poles as you can see from the image below the diameter of the balls is smaller than the inner diameter of the tube it is identical if flip it edit heres gif showing what happens if leave it be for while then shake it looks like knzhou is right

394975 in this answer on the cycling se the claim is made that adding more mass to bicycle increases the stopping distance was under the impression that mass should not affect the stopping distance so long as all the other factors remain the same balance coefficient of friction etc what factors in this scenario contribute to increasing stopping distance on bicycle if the bicycle is balanced the same but weighs more will the stopping distance be equal

395227 love particle and nuclear physics and im starting to search some things about it even though im only high school student so my doubt is is it possible to create antimuons positive charged muons in particle accelerator but without colliding two beams mean only colliding beam against objects or with the help of machines like cherenkov detectors or muon filters
395292 suppose we have classical hamiltonian that can be divided into an easy part and difficult part delta that depends on parameter begin equation delta end equation the partition function can be written as begin equation sum text states beta beta delta end equation because its classical system so and delta commute the partition function of the easy part begin equation sum text states beta end equation is supposed to be easy to compute common way to solve this problem is to work perturbatively on we find begin equation begin aligned sum text states big beta big beta delta frac bigg beta delta big cdots big big sum text states beta cdot big beta langle delta rangle frac beta langle delta rangle cdots big end aligned end equation where langle rangle equiv frac sum text states beta is the mean value of using the problem is that propto because it is an extensive variable so beta propto while langle delta rangle only scales as when calculating the helmholtz energy in the thermodynamic limit begin equation begin aligned lim rightarrow infty frac kt lnz lim rightarrow infty frac kt lnz frac kt ln big beta langle delta rangle frac beta langle delta rangle big end aligned end equation the first term scales as frac lne so it is finite but the second term scales as frac ln1 so it should vanish how do we use perturbation theory in the thermodynamic limit then

395829 the bohr model of the atom is essentially that the nucleus is ball and the electrons are balls orbiting the nucleus in rigid orbit this allowed for chemists to find model of chemical bonding where the electrons in the outer orbits could be exchanged and it works pretty well as seen in the lewis structures however electron orbitals were found to be less rigid and instead be fuzzy fields which instead of being discrete rigid orbits look more like however in chemistry education like organic chemistry you still learn about chemical reactions using essentially diagrams that are modified lewis structures that take into account information about electron orbitals what im wondering is if the bohr model is used essentially throughout college education in the form of these diagrams it seems like it must be pretty accurate model even though it turns out atoms are more fuzzy structures than discrete billiard balls so im wondering what the inaccuracies are and if there is better way to understand them than the bohr model if you build computer simulation of atoms with the bohr model im wondering if it would be accurate in the sense of modeling atomic phenomena or is it not good model to perform simulations on if not im wondering what an alternative model is that is better for simulation essentially how good the bohr model is as diagram as tool for learning and as tool for simulation
396005 superselection rule is rule that forbids superposition of quantum states as stated by lubos here one cannot superpose states with different charges because of the conservation of charge an example in the initial comments involved the decomposition of the hilbert space to superselection sectors mathcal corresponding to states with different electric charges they dont talk to each other state with 7e may evolve to states with 7e only in general these conservation laws must be generalized to broader concept superselection rules each superselection rule may decompose the hilbert space into finer sectors alternatively one might say we dont have to consider such superpositions it doesnt matter if there are other branches of the wavefunction with different because theyll never interfere so we might as well toss them out this doesnt affect the results of experiments im confused why this same logic doesnt forbid almost any superposition whatsoever for example we often talk about superposition of spin states psi rangle frac uparrow rangle downarrow rangle sqrt or superposition of momentum states psi rangle frac rangle rangle sqrt despite the conservation of angular momentum and momentum why exactly does superselection not forbid these kinds of superpositions as well superselection has been discussed on this site few times but havent been able to find an argument that applies to conservation of charge but doesnt apply to conservation of momentum this isnt duplicate one thought had was that when we prepare superposition of momentum states we arent really breaking superselection because there is backreaction on the preparation apparatus so we really have psi rangle frac text app recoils back rangle text app recoils forward rangle sqrt and the two states do have the same momentum then the original state we proposed is attained by just tracing out the apparatus this doesnt decohere the superposition as explained here this sounds plausible to me but then dont understand why the same couldnt be said for charge conservation leaving us with no superselection rules at all its true that charge is discrete but there are supposed to be superselection rules for continuous conserved quantities too

396818 part of the reason that relativistic qft is so hard to learn is that there are piles of no go theorems that rule out simple physical examples and physical intuition very common answer to the question why cant we do simpler or think about it this way is because of this no go theorem to give few examples we have the reeh schlieder theorem which im told forbids position operators in relativistic qft the coleman mandula theorem which forbids mixing internal and spacetime symmetries haags theorem which states that naive interaction picture perturbation theory cannot work the weinberg witten theorem which among other things rules out conserved current for yang mills the spin statistics theorem which among other things rules out fermionic scalars the cpt theorem which rules out cpt violation the coleman gross theorem which states the only asymptotically free theory is yang mills of course all these theorems have additional assumptions im leaving out for brevity but the point is that lorentz invariance is crucial assumption for every one on the other hand nonrelativistic qft as practiced in condensed matter physics doesnt have nearly as many restrictions resulting in much nicer examples but the only difference appears to be that they work with rotational symmetry group of sod while particle physicists use the lorentz group sod hardly big change is there fundamental intuitive reason that relativistic qft is so much more restricted
396984 understand that the em field has an em charge and that nucleus made of neutrons and protons has an opposite em charge and this attracts and because the electrons kinetic energy that would make the electron fly away repels so the attraction and the repelling equal out so the electron is in stable quantized energy level in the em field it will not change its energy level without for example photon absorption and it also makes the nucleus stable understand the neutron does not have em charge and that strong force and residual strong force nuclear force works between two neutrons keeps them stick together question can nucleus of only neutrons exist and be stable can the nuclear force work between two neutrons even without protons next to them can this nucleus exist and be stable since it does not have em charge without an em field
397576 yes know its steel its everywhere on the web and did google but seek enlightenment my physics textbook defines elasticity as property by virtue of which material regains its shape or the ability of material to resist change in its shape or size while get what my textbook intends to say strongly think that there is subtle difference between the definitions mean according to the first definition certainly rubber is more elastic than steel as rubber has tendency to regain its shape even when stretched several times its natural length on the other hand steel bar would become permanently set and even fracture if the strain increases ever so slightly lets keep but it requires tremendous force out of the way here thats not the main point here in this sense obviously rubber is more elastic but the second definition makes clear that steel is the winner steel has greater tendency to resist its shape change and hence it should be more elastic so it is very clear that we can define elasticity ways either by picture of strain tolerance winner rubber or by stress tolerance winner steel most of the physicists but definitely not all seem to prefer the stress tolerance definition mostly without clarification what seek here is logicaland maybe philosophical answer to why why prefer one definition over other especially the one which defies common sense of general public when everyone seems to agree with rubber as winner why change the rules
397694 say you cook up model about physical system such model consists of say system of differential equations what criterion decides whether the model is classical or quantum mechanical none of the following criteria are valid partial differential equations both the maxwell equations and the schr dinger equation are pdes but the first model is clearly classical and the second one is not conversely finite dimensional quantum systems have as equations of motion ordinary differential equations so the latter are not restricted to classical systems only complex numbers you can use those to analyse electric circuits so thats not enough conversely you dont need complex numbers to formulate standard qm cf this pse post operators and hilbert spaces you can formulate classical mechanics la koopman von neumann in the same vein dirac von neumann axioms these are too restrictive they do not accommodate topological quantum field theories also certain model may be formulated in such way that its very hard to tell whether it satisfies these axioms or not for example the schr dinger equation corresponds to model that does not explicitly satisfy these axioms and only when formulated in abstract terms this becomes obvious its not clear whether the same thing could be done with the maxwell equations in fact one can formulate these equations as dirac like equation gamma mu partial mu gamma psi see which can be recast in abstract terms as dot psi psi for certain probabilities classical statistical mechanics does also deal with probabilistic concepts also one could argue that standard qm is not inherently probabilistic but that probabilities are an emergent property due to the measurement process and our choice of observable degrees of freedom plancks constant its just matter of units you can eliminate this constant by means of the redefinition to hbar one could even argue that this would be natural definition from an experimental point of view if we agree to measure frequencies instead of energies conversely you may introduce this constant in classical mechanics by similar change of variables say hbar tilde in the newton equation needless to say such change of variables would be unnatural but naturalness is not well defined criterion for classical vs quantum realism determinism this seems to depend on interpretations but whether theory is classical or quantum mechanical should not depend on how we interpret the theory it should be intrinsic to the formalism people are after quantum theory of gravity what prevents me from saying that general relativity is already quantum mechanical it seems intuitively obvious that it is classical theory but im not sure how to put that intuition into words none of the criteria above is conclusive
397711 is it possible for molecule or atom to orbit star the sun or is there always too much outward force imparted by solar radiation compared to the inward force of gravitational attraction
397954 de broglie theory says every matter has duality nature wave and particle but we dont see any wave nature in any matter why
397971 we have the euler equations for rotating body as follows dot omega omega omega 3i dot omega omega omega 3i dot omega omega omega 1i where are the moments of inertia about the axis and omega is the angular velocity about this axis it can be shown that if then objects with angular velocity very close to vec omega are unstable why is this and how can try to picture it tried to picture this using ball but realised this is probably not good way to visualise it since ball is spherically symmetric so the moments of inertia are not distinct is there any visualisation or animation that could allow me to see this rotation and possibly understand why it is unstable in response to srss comment am not sure about any references but know how to do it let omega eta omega eta where eta is small perturbation and suppose omega eta then the euler eqns become dot eta eta eta tag1 dot eta eta tag2 dot eta eta eta tag3 differentiate and sub in to the resulting expression ddot eta frac 3i 3i eta if then the constant on the right hand side is positive so the solution to this equation is an exponential if it was any other order then the solution would be sin cos therefore it is unstable edit to clarify posted this question to see other more visual ways of understanding this effect rather than solving the equations as did above and to see how this effect comes into play in real life so dont think it is duplicate of the other questions since they dont have answers that fit this
398047 what would the horizon look like on an infinite plane can imagine the growth of horizon to be similar to decreasing exponential function where the growth of horizon decreases more as the distance away from it increases see graph below assume is horizon growth and is plane length but what if the length was infinite clearly the horizon cant just keep going up and up that would be mathmatically impossible but in the real world if there is limit where is it
398092 electrons have more energy with higher voltage so it seems that voltage would be what actually determines how harmful it is because it would have more energy to lose
398184 if have metal ring and heat it up will expect thermal expansion from my point of view of expansion the metal will expand to free space in that case the inner radius of the ring should be smaller and the outer diameter of the ring should be bigger understand that is not the case but could anyone explain me why
398501 have got serious doubt have read yellow light from low pressure sodium vapour is monochromatic how can it be monochromatic when yellow light is combination of red and green primary colours
399281 when talking about relativity we always mention lorentz contraction if body is moving with velocituy in the direction its length will be contracted in that direction the length remains the same in the orthogonal directions this is usually seen as obvious as the velocity is zero in those directions so the object might as well be at rest as long as those directions are concerned however student today raised an objection she said no this is not obvious the moving object is not at rest and cannot be sure what happens in principle there could be contraction in all directions she wanted physical reason to convince her that no contraction takes place in the orthogonal directions she took me off guard and didnt know what to say it is sometimes hard to argue the obvious any help
399297 in the book of the first three minutes by weinberg on pages it is stated that second frame the temperature of the universe is million degrees kelvin the nuclear particle balance has conse quently shifted to per cent neutrons and per cent protons third frame the temperature of the universe is million degrees kelvin the decreasing temperature has now allowed the proton neutron balance to shift to per cent neutrons and per cent protons what is the reason for this balance shift between neutrons and protons and what determines the rate of change of the neutron proton ratio
399462 since it was reported recently that the supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies may in fact be as many as smaller black holes wondered if if these black holes collide with one another why they wouldnt be producing gravitational waves all the time but then also wondered that if whilst accepting material supermassive black holes must drastically increase the density of that material before it collides with the smbh why this wouldnt also cause gravitational waves since gws can presumably be caused by anything since colliding neutron stars also emit these waves why wouldnt any other source emit them also also why could they not be caused by seismic activity even if theres minute probability of such events occurring surely its possible that given all the potential sources of matching signal that it would happen eventually what are peoples thoughts on this matter
399463 while was watching popular science lecture on youtube came across this sentence sun is giving us low entropy not energy which was said by prof krzysztof meissner am not physicist but this sounds to me like huge leap would be pleased if someone could explain to me the difference
399841 why do we have constants consider for example the ideal gas law pv nrt tag ideal gas law sometimes believe that the constant is there in order to make the equation work make the units line up per se but other times feel like such assumptions are unnecessary dont entirely understand why that constant is used besides the fact that it is necessary for the units nb this is not intended to stir philosophical debate am purely curious of the nature of constants in cases such as not as understand that the speed of light is uniformly constantly am simply asking whether these constants are necessary for our equations and understandings or if they are universally constant
399846 was thinking of how light actually gets into my eyes and thought about my light bulb shining rays to every part of my bedroom wall and reflecting them towards me but then realized could be at many different locations and still see all that light so it must either be bouncing off in all directions or the light that shined elsewhere has bounced around the room to end up reflecting off the wall in all other directions so can view the entire wall from bazillions of atom offsets of spaces in my room but lets just concentrate on two atom positions directly on my index fingers the entire wall is shining directly into those two atoms so light is passing through other light that is heading towards another direction just with this simple scenario of the wall shining towards two positions in my imagination two pyramids of light colliding with each other which is hard to imagine how that works let alone the bazillions more intersecting constant flowing of light that reveals the slightest of dust in the air on sunny days from all places in your room and how it can travel out into space like the stars do towards earth from light years away just concentrating into smaller and smaller amounts of atoms space it really breaks my mind at how light even works so guess my question is pretty much how does light travel
400081 many elementary particles decay for instance charm quark according to wikipedia will decay into strange quark and assume some other elementary particles but dont know what they are does this imply that on some fundamental level both charm quarks and strange quarks share composition my probably naive reasoning is that in chemistry if have substance isolated in vacuum and it decays into and then almost composed of some ratio of and as an example rm caco rightarrow cao co which can be used to demonstrate that calcium carbide consists of the same substances that compose calcium oxide and carbon dioxide does this logic not apply on quantum level
400102 if dark matter interacts with ordinary matter at all it should most likely occur where ordinary matter is densest hence we have papers about neutron stars possibly containing dark matter cores example but if neutron stars can have dark matter cores white dwarfs the sun or even the earth can have dark matter cores too theyre just less likely to have such cores if the sun earth does have such core dark matter would be much easier to study since theyre so nearby is there any observational evidence that the sun earth is ordinary matter if no what is the observational limit of the sun earths dark matter fraction ive seen popular level articles example about such theories but theyre all rather speculative
400162 have read the following on wikipedia but cant understand it in quantum mechanics the schr dinger equation which describes the continuous time evolution of systems wave function is deterministic however the relationship between systems wave function and the observable properties of the system appears to be non deterministic deterministic system wikipedia links omitted how can system be deterministic and not deterministic at the same time can anyone explain simply

400824 have seen random errors being defined as those which average to as the number of measurements goes to infinity and that the error is equally likely to be positive or negative this only requires symmetric probability distribution about zero however typing this question into google did not find single source that suggested random errors could be anything other than gaussian why must random errors be gaussian
401485 was reading book review by freeman dyson at http www nybooks com articles the key to everything and he makes the following statement at the end of the 13th paragraph 3rd dropcap and beginning of the 14th any object whose motions are dominated by gravity will have energy decreasing as temperature increases and energy increasing as temperature decreases as consequence of the second law of thermodynamics when energy flows from one such object to another the hot object will grow hotter and the cold object will grow colder that is why the sun grew hotter and the planets grew cooler as the solar system evolved could someone help me understand that statement doesnt the second statement imply violation of the first law of thermodynamics what are the objects here clouds of gas planets balls falling from towers
401491 one question that popped up during the studies of special and general relativity which am forced to take unfortunately is the following how do we know that this is due to the bending of space time and not just plain old 3rd semester diffraction if you find this silly question downvote otherwise consider the following picture the sun is the straightedge the screen is the earth and the star is the point source this is simplified to great extent but the idea still holds think
401668 imagine black hole originally formed from for example rubidium atoms on the other hand one made from for example helium atoms will it be there any difference between the two or perhaps once formed it all turns into the same type of matter can the composition of the matter energy in the black hole be inferred somehow could one say that black hole substance is distinct form or state of matter different from other forms or states of matter
401715 so im working on nuclear physics problem and am looking at radioactive decay the common unit used for very long decays is years within the literature is this the sidereal or tropical year want to use units of seconds but seeing as how these minutes seconds that differential will add up over time would guess tropical but thats just guess and on the same note what about days hours or hours minutes and seconds bonus points for source

401853 learned from the class about the equation for hydrogen atoms electron where textbook assumed that the center nuclei of hydrogen atom was fixed at origin however since every particle was wave the nuclei of the hydrogen atom say only contain one proton could be seen wave as well my question was that whats the wave equation for the proton in hydrogen atom was it simply traveling wave when the atom was moving and dirac delta function when it was fixed further what if there was neutron in the case when hydrogen was traveling say along axis would there be an extra influence interaction towards the electrons wave equation
402118 does charged particle an electron say travelling with uniform velocity induce magnetic field believe it doesnt in primary school we all learned how to induce magnetic field into an iron nail by wrapping coils of wire around the nail and then hooking it up to dc battery but if you do not coil the wire the magnetic nail doesnt occur whats happening here my only guess are the electrons are accelerating the magnitudes of their speeds arent changing but rather their directions in the coil force must be applying itself to the electrons in order for them to make their spiralling paths thus they are said to be accelerating and that is what causes the magnetic field to develop
402222 is the amount of heat required to melt circ 10cm 10cm 10cm cubic ice equal to the amount of heat required to melt piece circ mu mu mu cubic ice think it should be equal but something confuses me have two same circ piece of ice and cut one of them into half without melting it which uses energy then melt them all if the amount of heat required to melt two half pieces of ice is equal to the amount of heat required to melt single piece of ice why cut before melt process use more energy to turn ice into water
402251 just want to confirm this because this type of diagram seems pretty popular the electric field and magnetic field actually surround in all directions orthogonal to axis right it is not just 2d pointing only in the direction and direction respectively
402363 think the title about says it all if someone asks me what good is the theory of general relativity or what did einstein do that was so great or whatever my pat answer is you use gps right well gps requires knowing the location in time and space of gps satellites to an astonishing precision the only way to obtain that precision is through an understanding of general relativity or whats this bose einstein condensate good for will answer that it enables extraordinarily precise measurements of the earths gravitational field years ago this was actively being tested as new means of navigating submarines theres lot of background as to why thats important that go into but presumably most readers here understand those reasons so how does one answer the question what good is knowing about these quark things anyway does any technology depend upon them ps while writing up this question and double checking that it wasnt duplicate saw this question why does gps depend on relativity which implies my assertion about gps may be wrong but if nothing else it demonstrates that the impact of general relativity can be measured using devices systems that are known to most people
402383 this question is inspired by similar one asked on quora lets say wizard magicked jupiter into the sun with or without high velocity what happens the quora question has two completely opposed answers one saying nothing much happens and the other saying the sun goes out for several hundred years both answers give reasons and calculations and know enough about physics to find both of them plausible however its plainly impossible that both answers are correct which one or both is incorrect why is it incorrect
402683 if no well this cant be as there is perfect symmetry you cant tell one from the other if yes they had relative velocities all along then their times must have dilated and somehow they must not agree with each other know am wrong please help me find out where for all those who are marking this as duplicate question of what is the proper way to explain the twin paradox think this is not same as plain old twin paradox because its made symmetric and the essence of the question is not how do you solve twin paradox instead it is why is this not like twin paradox
402950 the book mathematical physics by eugene butkov has on chapter the equation for held string by held mean with endpoints fixed and both at the same height as being frac partial partial fx rhoxg rhox frac partial partial where is the tension an external force rho the density gravity and transversal vertical displacement however the book derives this equation assuming the string deforms little from the horizontal position and the tension is contant such assumptions are strong think plus for the stationary case frac partial partial it doesnt seem to differentiate between string hanging by its own weight and string being pulled by constant force and we know these two situations are different since the solution for them is catenary and parabola respectively what is the exact equation for held string
403016 is there physical limit to data transfer rate for usb this rate can be few gbit per second am wondering if there is physical law giving fundamental limit to data transfer rate similar to how the second law of thermodynamics tells us perpetual motion cannot happen and relativity tells us going faster than light is impossible
403024 plan an experiment as follows neutrino source provides only neutrinos and detector is sensitive only to antineutrinos if you get signal that proves that neutrinos are their own antiparticles if something as simple would work reckon it would have been done already so why does this not work or does it and we have to rely on neutrinoless double beta decay searches
403025 have read these questions and their answers dark matter black holes could dark matter form black hole does dark matter originate from matter falling into black hole following up dark matter accretion in supermassive black holes none of those answered what am asking dark matter does not interact with em waves so it is not visible directly creates gravitational effects black hole does not let em waves escape so it is not directly observable creates gravitational effects based on these facts there seems to be similarity between dark matter and black holes could it be that the regions of space intra galaxy clusters where we found gravitational effects that cannot be explained with normal matter so where we suspect dark matter to exist that that region of space in between galaxy clusters is just region that is full of black holes that would have the same gravitational effects and would not be visible directly
403261 why are rainbows relatively rare on any given day there are billions of water drops in the air of varying sizes and dispersions all of which light is passing through and refracting what physical phenomenon has to occur so that these drops combine to form rainbow why is it more digital visible or not than analog is it that the drops have to be consistently dispersed and sized if that was the case why dont rainbows appear just in the regions that have suitable makeup or does single drop cause the refraction we see across the sky was trying to explain rainbows to my kids but got totally confused here is an example of rainbow at my work 00am in edwards california facing west no rain but it was partly cloudy the rainbow seemed to have no connection to the clouds hopefully the answers will allow for the existence of this rainbow thanks
403646 while studying the basics of quantum computers came across hadamard gates and learned that these gates are used to put qubits into superposition meaning that these qubits are both and at the same time ive also learned that superposition is very susceptible to external influences and can be destroyed quickly given that superposition seems to be so fragile does it exists naturally are there particles that are in superposition for longer period of time
403687 as 8th grader am still newbie at science and have problems understanding the forces that can not imagine and one of these forces is the moment we are told that text moment nm but how can certain force be applied when there is how does it depend on the length of the considered object and how can moment be defined on the basis of that representation and what would be the effect if the moment value is increased by the newton part as opposed to the effect when the value is increased by the length part or is the result the same in both cases

404149 in biology the concept of parity emerges in the context of chiral molecules where two molecules exist with the same structure but opposite parity interestingly one enantiomer often strongly predominates over the other in natural biological systems glucose is ubiquitous glucose is rare in nature in physics it has been established that weak interactions violate parity which if understand correctly implies physical difference between left and right handed systems this suggests to me the following questions does parity violation in physics affect the physical or chemical properties of chiral molecules and does this have any implications for our understanding of biological homochirality

404421 more precisely are event horizons null geodesic congruences meaning they admit local parametrisation muts with ldotsd such that for any constant the muts curve is null geodesic meaning if mu frac partial mu partial then and mu nabla mu nu equivalently if drop light ray on any event on an event horizon is there always an initial momentum such that it remains on the horizon for finite time in the past or in the future in addition is the answer sensible to the dimension of spacetime the type of event horizon black hole cosmological at first thought this was obvious by definition but then after some thought realised it really isnt an event horizon is essentially defined as an envelope of past directed null geodesics from future null infinity so theres no obvious reason for which the horizon itself should be made out of such null geodesics compare to the trivial example of circle which is the envelope of the family of all lines tangent to it yet its not line itself however cant think of counterexample

407289 notice that online definitions of this experimental law always say molecules or atoms from the wikipedia article on avogadros law frac frac the equation shows that as the number of moles of gas increases the volume of the gas also increases in proportion similarly if the number of moles of gas is decreased then the volume also decreases thus the number of molecules or atoms in specific volume of ideal gas is independent of their size or the molar mass of the gas in lumenlearning key points the number of molecules or atoms in specific volume of ideal gas is independent of size or the gas molar mass this made me wonder if in the pv nrt can also be the number of atoms in that volume of gas taking practical example what is the answer to the following question statement atoms can neither be created nor destroyed statement ii under similar conditions of temperature and pressure equal volumes of gases do not contain an equal number of atoms my question is if and are equal can we say number of atoms are equal the answer given is that no they need not be equal since only number of molecules will be equal the gas can consist of mixture of diatomic and triatomic molecules we can have the same number of molecules but different number of atoms from what read on kinetic molecular theory the volume occupied by the molecules of the gas is negligible compared to the volume of the gas itself this is the central assumption so guess the law applied only to molecules and not atoms or the generic particles as how some sites define it
407397 suppose one knows nothing about the concept of entropy how can we argue that the lack of information ignorance about the system typically increases with the increase in the temperature using the formula of the canonical probability beta where is the canonical partition function assume that system has fixed volume and fixed number of particles here is the objective if can argue that lack of information typically increases with temperature can use that to argue that entropy typically increases with temperature by equating lack of information with entropy

407927 there is this surprising asking photons where they have been prl article about experiment where they are able to ask photons which mirrors they have visited by vibrating each mirror with different frequency and performing fourier transform of the final beam visited mirrors are marked in the power spectrum the problem is that this way they see mirrors we would naively say they shouldnt mirrors ab below the small inteferometer with mirrors ab is set for destructive interference such that no photons go through mirror what is tested in the lower setting that if we block beam from mirror no light gets to detector for explanation the article uses two state vector formalism tsvf that langle phi psi rangle should be undestood that psi rangle is result of forward propagator from infty to now langle phi of backward propagator from infty to now what seems kind of natural when thinking about feynman path integral formulation using ensemble of paths from infty to infty they explain that we see mirrors because only these tree are visited by photons propagating in both time directions is it the proper understanding of this experiment can it be explained without back propagation
409089 is there any evidence for dark matter besides just its gravitational effects what getting at is why are we so quick to assume it any kind of matter at all rather than just some unexplained fluke of gravity
409105 know you cant have work without any displacement so was kind of wondering as to what keeps for example man on jetpack off the ground but with no more change in height from the initial height he was on is this still form of energy or something else because if he burns fuel to keep himself off the ground doesnt that mean energy is being used
409189 assuming that dark matter is not made of wimps weakly interacting massive particles but interacts only gravitationally what would be the possible mechanism giving mass to dark matter particles if they dont interact weakly they couldnt get mass from interacting with the higgs field the energy of gravitational interactions alone does not seem to be sufficient to account for large particle mass would this imply that dark matter consists of very large number of particles with very small mass perhaps much smaller than of neutrinos or do we need quantum gravity to explain the origin of mass of dark matter
409313 as far as understand the higgs mechanism is crucial component of the standard model which is responsible for the weak gauge bosons acquiring mass otherwise forbidden by renormalizability constraints however is there any justification for the fermion masses arising from yukawa coupling to the higgs field or is this just assumed as handy byproduct with no alternative explanations present what counters the idea of considering the masses as fundamental parameters instead of associated with the yukawa couplings

410192 was watching very interesting short documentary in which the author said that while it takes minutes in space to loop around the black hole an observer from earth observes that it takes minutes from earth understand that this has to do with relativity but does this mean that the astronaut feels that the time passed is minutes while those on earth feel it took minutes or is time actually sped up if time is sped up does that mean that doing chemical reaction takes less time to complete in space or is it just the same time felt differently by an astronaut
410226 common identity in quantum mechanics is relation between the momentum of photon and its wavelength frac lambda the identity is discussed here for example https en wikipedia org wiki matter wave apparently this is the identity rearranged by de broglie to give the wavelength of the wave nature of particle but where does this identity come from in the first place have seen some quite hand wavy ways of deriving this using mc but it seems quite strange having to rely on relativity to obtain this identity or is it exactly what we must do this seems to be quite fundamental identity in quantum mechanics so would like to understand its justification as well as possible ive been told that light having momentum is an idea present in classical mechanics as well and was known much before quantization of light and photons were discovered
410359 we know that in classical thermodynamics rms sqrt frac 3k however we immediately see that this is wrong for high temperatures as there is no upper bound on velocity how do get the exact equation my approach we have sqrt 2c 2c now from thermal energy we have total energy to besum of rest energy and thermal energy frac thus oc frac sqrt 2c 2c here mv frac sqrt frac then we can solve for sim rms am not sure if this is right can someone correct me can you give me atleast the final result if not the entire drivation
410549 consider two nuclei and let the binding energy of is less than the binding energy of is unstable compared to and is known to be radioactive does it mean that also has to be radioactive if comparing binding energies is not sufficient criterion to determine whether nucleus will be radioactive or not what is
410604 massless particles such as photons and gluons move with the speed of light and consequently experience no time according to special relativity time stops at the speed of light as result massless particles exist in the same moment of their proper time from the emission to absorption therefore massless particles cannot decay or experience any other change practical example of this logic is that neutrinos have mass because massless neutrinos cannot oscillate it seems that two massless particles that dont experience time should not be able to interact with each other at least without the interaction mediated by virtual massive particles this holds true for photons not interacting with each other in the first order resulting in the linearity of the electromagnetic field qcd is non linear theory with gluons interacting with each other via and vertices specifically the gluon vertex please correct me if am wrong under specific conditions can be viewed as gluon decay into two gluons however massless particles cannot decay according to special relativity what is the explanation of why massless gluons can interact with each other and apparently even decay while not experiencing time
410887 if space is quantized and particles are quantized then the chance of particle showing up in specific unit of space must be rational fraction could quantum mechanics calculation ever output percentage likelihood that is an irrational number for example could it state that the chance of an electron showing up in certain location is sqrt or pi or does it always have to be rational fraction
411073 we say the earth is in relative motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background cmb causing anisotropies in the cmb spectrum have four very simple questions about this how is it possible to treat the cmb bath of blackbody photons in space as reference frame in particular this frame must be at rest with respect to something what is that thing what do we mean by anisotropies in blackbody spectrum why should our motion cause anisotropy and in particular dipole anisotropy how do we quantitatively express the anisotropy
411283 have question about why exactly the twisting of the field lines in tokamak solves the magnetic confinement issue my understanding is that the magnetic confinement issue arises in the toroidal geometry because from amperes law it follows that the field will be stronger near the inner part of the torus the field falls off like this causes charged particles to drift either up or down as they spiral around the field lines since due to the varying field strength the local radius of curvature alternates between larger and smaller understand how inducing current in the plasma causes the field to twist causing the field lines to make helical shape dont see though exactly how this solves the confinement issue while the the field lines do make helical shape it seems like the local strength of the magnetic field will remain roughly the same and so dont see really how the twisting prevents the drifting previously described can someone clarify for me
411314 if take watt heating element put it in glass of water and put them both inside sealed imaginary chamber that does not conduct heat outside again imaginary will the water eventually boil if not dont understand why since electricity keeps flowing through the heating element generating more and more energy in joules and since temperature is just an increase in joules per kilogram in an ideally sealed chamber heat would accumulate and slowly raise the temperature
411500 please help me to clarify situation with shape of electromagnetic waves edit from comments see root of problem afraid im no so smart as all of you so simply dont get what you talking about all these waveguides near far fields and other similar things unfortunately dont know any of calculus also beside that feel some language barier so rephrase my questions to be more specific trying to express what exactly cant understand and would prefer answers in simple non math terms edit2 would like to thank you all for the answers and comments they were very useful at least feel ive got some basic understanding ok let start with simplest em radiation case oscillating charge here is 3d animation of single pulse full cycle would be like this cant understand why vec and vec fields are take such orthogonal form and how it can satisfy maxwells equations and in particular faradays law there is usually mathematical proof in textbooks why it so with explanation considering some region of space in which such wave are exists and im lost in this point because thought induced electric fields in case of time varying magnetic fields looks like this ok maybe they not always take form of circles but at least loops are always closed now as for me in case of em wave we got same situation and here is part of explanation confirming this faradays law relates changing magnetic flux to non coulomb electric field because the region of space in which and are nonzero is moving the magnetic field at particular location in space changes with time and this time varying magnetic field is associated with curly electric field with the right thumb pointing in the direction of db dt the fingers of the right hand curl clockwise which is the sense of the electric field around the path similar time varying magnetic field but it looks completely different dont see any circular fields around changing vec there just vertical perpendicular vec field which moves to the right no horizontal or any curly components roughly speaking it looks like electrostatic but with no any charges at same time there also is mention about right hand rule in text must be blind or something and just think that same problem with magnetic fields they not in forms circles as well maybe these orthogonal propagating fields just small part of main global induced fields which forms closed loops like it should be dont know feels like cant see the whole picture hence questions are question is this vertical vec field in wave are actually induced question why there is no any components of vec field except for vertical if it induced question in other words how such orthogonal constitution of fields can satisfy faradays law which implies closed loops in induced vec fields question looks like these em waves can take pretty different and complex forms does it means that in this case of oscillating charge induced electric and magnetic fields just take this simple orthogonal shape and this does not contradict faradays ampere maxwells laws despite of this constitution thanks for help here is similar question unfortunately without satisfying answer
412114 being more specific lets say place an object on top of table this will result on the table applying normal force on the object my question is why does this force exists is it because of the existence of eletrical forces between the table and the object that makes repulsion or even because the object deforms the structure of the table and the intramolecular forces are trying to fix it make the table that is solid go back to its normal structure that way aplying force
412333 two springs in parallel with weight of will stretch certain amount while the same two springs arranged in series will stretch more under the same weight and so store more energy im fine with this part including the calculations however started to wonder since you have the same number of springs and the same weight the two systems must have the same energy overall but if less energy is stored in the parallel arrangement where does the difference in energy go suspect it is gravitational potential energy in the weight but cant find anywhere that explicitly says this any help would be much appreciated
412403 suppose wire of length carrying current is kept in uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the current the force on the wire will be ibl and work done by magnetic force when wire moves distance along the force will be ibld but magnetic force cannot do any work on moving charged particle and hence total work done on all particles by magnetic force should be zero where does the work ibld come from
413184 imagine you have mirror which looks like this since it is an ordinary household mirror when you zoom in on it it should have fractal like structure so when you zoom in it may look something like this surface like this should reflect light in all directions right
413406 the gravitational potential text pot has units of energy per unit mass bigg rm frac kg bigg bigg rm frac kg cdot cdot kg bigg bigg rm frac bigg the gravitational force is nabla text pot so this would lead me to believe that unit wise due to the gradient we have similar expression to the above apart from an additional rm in the denominator bigg rm frac kg cdot bigg bigg rm frac kg cdot cdot kg bigg bigg rm frac bigg but force has units of newtons bigg rm bigg bigg rm frac kg cdot bigg neq bigg rm frac bigg so why am missing rm kg in my units when take the gradient of the gravitational potential
413604 from taylors theorem we know that function of time xt can be constructed at any time as xt x0 dot 0t ddot frac dddot frac tag by knowing an infinite number of initial conditions x0 dot ddot dddot at on the other hand it requires only two initial conditions x0 and dot to obtain the function xt by solving newtons equation frac dt xt fx dot tag understand that is second order ordinary differential equation and hence to solve it we need two initial conditions x0 and dot but how do we reconcile which requires only two initial conditions with which requires us to know an infinite number of initial informations to construct xt how is it that the information from higher order derivatives at become redundant my guess is that due to the existence of the differential equation all the initial conditions in do not remain independent but im not sure
413659 it is easy to construct any operator in continuous variables using the set of operators ell rangle langle where and are integers and the operators are represented in the fock basis any operator hat can be written as hat sum ellm alpha ellm ell rangle langle where alpha ellm are complex coefficients my question is can we do the same thing with the set dagger ell actually this boils down to single example which would be sufficient can we find coefficients alpha ell such that rangle langle sum ell alpha ell dagger ell here rangle is the vacuum and take
413741 know an electric field can exist without magnetic field as in the case where you have stationary point charge but magnetic fields are created by moving charges so wouldnt you always need an electric field to have magnetic field even in the case of permanent magnets from what know its the aligned moving electrons in the atoms of the material which cause the magnetic properties so doesnt that mean theres always an electric field in order to have magnetic field
413846 in reading these discussions often see these two different definitions assumed yet they are very different which is correct does gravity cause the bending of spacetime or is gravity the bending of spacetime or do we not know or is it just semantics would in the absence of spacetime my apple still fall to the earth
414045 in some statics problems the question may say something like torque is applied about point ive always assumed this was simplification and the torque was created using force and moment arm recently learned that circularly polarized light can exert torque on quarter wave plate as the plate converts the beams angular momentum to linear momentum in this case cant determine where the moment arm is is it possible that there isnt one
414057 is it true that an electric current that flows through conductor creates magnetic field around the conductor if yes then why doesnt the magnetic sensor of my mobile device react in any way to changes when bring the device near to the wire connected to electricity at home
414187 have read this https en wikipedia org wiki neutrino the weak force has very short range gravity is extremely weak on the subatomic scale and neutrinos as leptons do not participate in the strong interaction thus neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected now we know that from black holes even light cannot escape and neutrinos should have rest mass but neutrinos are not affected by gravity on the subatomic scale because gravity is very weak on that scale and neutrinos interact very weakly the only reason even light cannot escape black hole is gravity stress energy that bends spacetime but since neutrinos are not affected by it on the subatomic scale neutrinos should pass through black hole question do neutrinos pass through black holes like through normal matter has there been any experiment to measure whether we can detect neutrinos that passed through black holes
414514 considering that the gravitational field of spherical shell is rectified in its interior can consider that even then the time inside it is dilated with respect to distant clock imagine the following situation massive spherical shell located in the cosmos away from everything inside it has watch on the outside of the shell is second watch far from this shell is the third watch these clocks were initially synchronized but the second clock already shows significant delay compared to the third clock would like to know the time that indicates think the watch inside the spherical shell is slow and always it will indicate the same time as the second watch because there is rectified gravitational field internally with the same intensity value as that field located near the external surface would like to know time time or time time
414521 taut string anchored at both ends increases in tension as the string is displaced to side when released the string will vibrate at whatever frequency to which the system is tuned if this were simple standing wave it seems that tension would drop as the string moved to the neutral position and increase again as it deflected on the opposing side harmonics in this case would not change the behavior is this the way an actual string behaves or is there some other oscillation pattern that allows tension to remain relatively constant even as the string vibrates does vibrating string always produce changes in tension
414710 with reference to the discussion in an earlier question on the independence of metric and christoffel symbols it was discussed that the symmetry of the christoffel symbols gamma mu nu alpha gamma nu mu alpha is assumed and therefore there are versions of classical gr and quantum gravity theories which break this assumed symmetry to derive more general results have been following schutz to study gr and how to calculate various quantities in it in the image below am posting picture of part of where they seemingly prove the symmetry of christoffel symbols instead of just assuming it for reference equation referred to in the text is the vanishing covariant derivative of the metric tensor and is the covariant derivative of second rank tensor am guessing there is subtle point that am missing here because they are not assuming the symmetry in the book they proved it can anyone shed some light on how the symmetry is proved here and why not assumed

415594 while fidgeting with pair of reading glasses noticed strange reflection pattern shown in video and photo would appreciate it if anyone that knows more about this could help me figure out why there were eight dots in the reflection instead of four and why there were different colors when all the light sources were an orange yellow warm color there were eight dots in each frame four orange four green they made cube shape each one of the dots being corner of the cube the same image could be seen in each frame and if focused my eyes it looked 3d the picture below shows the light source that the reflection came from just four ordinary ceiling lights know it couldnt have been anything else because it was night and to test this turned off all other lights and it was still there in fact it was then even brighter looked into the glasses again in the morning the effect was still there thanks ella

416293 am interested in making simplified model that represents only the effect that the moon has on earths tides in this model am going to assume that the earth is completely spherical with no continents or surface variation and covered entirely by single ocean of water in simple terms want to know if the tidal bulges on the earth are different sizes or if they are of equal size in many diagrams it appears that the bulges are symmetrical but if the side of the earth facing the moon is experiencing greater gravitational force and the far side weaker gravitational force would that not result in the side facing the moon having proportionally larger tidal bulge do appreciate that most diagrams are purely illustrative and that the actual difference in size would be too small to practically depict on visual diagram have attached diagram that while exaggerated am wondering if it is more accurate that showing the bulges as equal in size
416427 have heard that the tidal force of black hole can tear apart an observer but if the spacetime fabric is really stretched out near black hole isnt the observer also part of it surely he is not sitting on top of it how could he distinguish himself being stretched given everything around him also is getting stretched
416443 quantities like position and time allow us to place our origin anywhere but can the same be said for energy was thinking about the way we have defined the quantity gravitational potential and for any finite distance from planet or body an abject would be said to have negative gravitational potential conveying that negative amount of work is done in bringing the object from infinity to that position but this seems impossible as negative energy does not seem to physically exist as far as know so does negative energy really exist or does it not implying that negative work done is just another mathematical argument edit the primary reason ask this question is because was wondering whether negative work done is fundamentally different from negative debts when talking about money or are they just the same mathematical convenience
417927 am not entirely sure this is an appropriate question for pse however since many of you have such diverse backgrounds ill give it shot have noticed that when one takes picture of computer tv screen with phone you can see what looks like saddle phase portrait why does this happen does it have any relevance to differential equations or other areas of math
418058 so while reading over equations of states learned that quantum gases do not conform to the same corresponding state behavior as normal fluids do why are these known as quantum gases and why do they not conform to the same corresponding state behavior as normal fluid one example of this language appearing in introduction to chemical engineering thermodynamics by jm smith is as follows the lee kessler correlation provides reliable results for gases which are nonpolar or only slightly polar for these errors of no more than or percent are indicated when applied to highly polar gases or to gases that associate larger errors can be expected the quantum gases hydrogen helium and neon do not conform to the same corresponding states behaviour as do normal fluids their treatment by the usual correlations is sometimes accommodated by use of temperature dependent effective critical parameters for hydrogen the quantum gas most commonly found in chemical processing the recommended equations are begin align mathrm frac frac quad text for tag mathrm bar frac frac quad text for tag mathrm cm mathrm mol frac frac quad text for tag end align
418436 the definition of work given in books is the work is said to be done by force on body when the body is moved by the force through some displacement now let body of mass at rest when force is applied on it it gets accelerated and starts moving it will keep moving until an another force is applied on the body if no other force is applied on the body to prevent its state of motion it will be continuously covering more and more displacement in the direction of applied force so in the above definition what does the word displacement refer to

419192 it is well known that when water flows through tube you can make it flow faster by making the tube narrow now consider what happens when group of people are moving and the space becomes narrower the opposite of what happens with water happens here people start to move slower was wondering if there is any fluid that shows this kind of behaviour and what would cause that

419696 suppose you have some jelly balls with similar refractive index as that of water like in this video you put them in water making it invisible so the optical behavior of the balls should be similar to that of water ive seen powerful lasers cutting glass so you can cut transparent objects with lasers so if you direct laser beam into the water can you burn the jelly balls inside

420123 why is it that when we discuss the microstate of system of particles we use position and momentum how does position and momentum tell us everything we need to know about single particle ive always been unsure as to why those quantities are used instead of any other like position mass velocity and etc
420288 icecube xenon etc keep yielding negative results if dark matter exists it doesnt interact with baryonic matter at the energy ranges they can detect the response is to build even bigger detectors to search for even fainter energy signatures why is there evidence that dark matter is supposed to have weak interactions instead of gravity only or is it just searching for your keys under the lamp post its the only possibility that we have way to detect
420403 if have black hole with mass thats exactly the same mass as star why does the black hole warp spacetime so much more light can escape than star light can escape with the exact same mass is it due to the black hole having singularity or it being more dense than the star or something else
420491 lets take the very simple problem of what happens if drop kg ball from height of meter classically mg and approx frac mathrm mathrm so the ball feels force of mathrm from ut gt we get that the ball hits the ground in about sqrt mathrm no problem in principle quantum mechanics should also be able to do this so we start with the dimensional time independent schrodinger equation with potential of gm frac hbar 2m nabla psi frac gm psi psi this is effectively the same equation as for solving the hydrogen atom potential but with different coefficients so the answer should take the same form and we get all the energy levels the quantum numbers etc but qualitatively this is clearly different from the classical result it means the ball has many quasi stable orbitals for example and it doesnt give precise prediction that the ball will hit the ground in sqrt mathrm in the classical problem its important that the ball was dropped from rest otherwise the time taken to hit the ground will vary but the quantum solution doesnt involve the initial conditions at all what has gone wrong my first thought was that need the time dependent schrodinger equation instead of the time independent one but that doesnt lead anywhere it just means the ball oscillates between solutions am missing some way to get the classical result from the schrodinger equation related but not quite the same is it possible to recover classical mechanics from schr dingers equation
420542 xkcd usually has solid and often contemporary science behind it lightning difference one says what that trick for telling how many miles away lightning is just count the seconds between the visible flash and the radio wave burst then multiply by billion usually its lightning versus thunder and you divide the time by or thereabouts to get the distance in miles here though light time for mile about meters would be about 3e seconds and if the difference between the visible light flash and the radio burst were one five billionths of second 2e seconds that suggests velocity difference of about ppm what is the physics behind that ppm difference
420552 from wikipedia the si base units and their physical quantities are the metre for measurement of length the kilogram for mass the second for time the ampere for electric current the kelvin for temperature the candela for luminous intensity and the mole for amount of substance as far as know base is unit which cannot be broken down into units other than those from the above mentioned units however degrees for angles and bit bytes for digital data cannot be expressed using one or more of the base units so why are these two units not considered base units
420605 cant for the life of me figure this out feel like im missing some crucial detail about how batteries work imagine two batteries connected in series like this circuit battery battery circuit as far as ive studied this is what happens the negative side of battery has surplus of electrons while the positive side of battery has normal concentration of electrons since electrons repel each other they kinda push themselves to battery am imagining tube with one side filled with elastic balls tightly packed and the other side with elastic balls but not pressed together the balls get pushed until they are all at an equal pressure number of electrons constantly reach the positive end of battery with force of volts in practical terms the electrons are colliding with the battery with higher intensity for some reason this causes the electrons coming out of the negative end of battery to have force of 2x volts dont understand why is it because there is now two times more free electrons at the negative end of battery and thus the difference between this end and battery is two times the normal the electrons get pushed again to the positive end of battery from what understand the material in the battery absorbs them and releases free electron on the negative end of battery please avoid using water analogies specifically want to know what happens at the atomic per electron level dont care much about the differences between each battery if possible pick battery type you prefer or just talk about batteries in general characteristics shared by all batteries
420708 in my textbook sears and zemanskys university physics it is written that the vector sum of the forces on the rope is zero however the tension is then is tension different than the force and if not then why force is zero while tension is not body that has pulling forces applied at its ends such as the rope in fig is said to be in tension the tension at any point is the magnitude of force acting at that point see fig 2c in fig 27b the tension at the right end of the rope is the magnitude of vec mathbf on or of vec mathbf on if the rope is in equilibrium and if no forces act except at its ends the tension is the same at both ends and throughout the rope thus if the magnitudes of vec mathbf on and vec mathbf on are rm each the tension in the rope is rm not rm the total force vector vec mathbf on vec mathbf on acting on the rope in this case is zero
421058 up to certain time was told photons light was just wave of energy then was told no light is actually particle and electrons in an atom absorb and re emit it but why do electrons bother to absorb and re emit light and not just let it pass all the time an electron would also be unstable by absorbing the energy and thus it re emits it but in the first place why does it absorb it note similar question was asked earlier how does an electron absorb or emit light but my question is not the same the earlier asked question was how does it happen and ask why does it happen
421081 when matter is dropped into black hole does the content of the matter impact the structure of the singularity that is to say other than the change in mass do any of the singularity properties change
421650 casually learning physics and have noticed that newton law of gravitation and the electrostatic force formulas look similar ve asked this question before but would really appreciate another response is it possible that the two laws are related can the law of gravitation be seen as the macroscopic averaging of coulomb law so atoms on average have negative charge positive mass and thus on macroscopic scale we observe that two large bodies eg planets attract rather than repel would it help if we assume that masses can be positive as well as negative apologies as not physicist rather data analyst and these are probably dumb questions
421863 have very basic understanding of quantum physics but as understand it the uncertainty principle says that the more precisely you know particle momentum and the less you know the particles position but wonder with the photon given that the velocity is constant so there is no uncertainty at all in the speed and so in the momentum does that mean for photon that the uncertainty of the position is infinite
421919 being physics grad student got used to the weird concepts behind quantum mechanics used to doesnt mean fully understand it though what mean is that im not surprised anymore by the fact that quantum system might be in superposition state that particle in potential well has discrete spectrum of energy that some pairs of observables cannot both be measured with arbitrary precision etc however the problem arises when im talking about my work to my non physicists friends and family they are not used to think quantum mechanically so when im saying that schr dingers cat is really simultaneously both alive and dead they dont get my point as it just seems crazy so have been thinking for while of what would be the easiest way to introduce them to the core principles of qm edit this part seems to have upset people dont want to go into the details of distinguishing simultaneously alive and dead until you measure vs superposition of alive and dead states mainly want them to understand that the outcome of the measure is indeterminate when they ask me so what is qm all about id like to give them short answer simple postulate principle that once accepted makes most key features of qm seem more natural in my opinion some of the weird ideas people find most difficult to accept due to some popular pseudoscience and or that are central to qm are quantum superposition complex amplitude phase as it leads to interference uncertainty principle entanglement quantization of physical quantities particles my problem is that cant explain how these ideas are related if my friends accept that particles can be in two states at once why couldnt they know both its position and momentum or if they accept that an electron has super abstract property called complex phase why should it lead to discrete spectrum of energy of course could just tell them that they need to accept it all at once but then the theory as whole becomes hard to swallow in my opinion qm sometimes suffers from bad reputation exactly because it requires to put all our classical intuitions to scrap while actually think it could make perfect sense even for non physicist given only or postulates above tried looking back at my own learning of qm with little success since undergrad students are often precisely bombarded with poorly justified postulates until they just stop questioning them few more points dont want to get started on mathematical definitions so nothing like quantum systems are in an infinite dimensional hilbert space as it doesnt mean anything to my relatives that includes pretty much all of the actual postulates of qm want my explanation to be more intuitive id like to avoid any mumbo jumbo related to wave particle duality think and know im not the only one that most explanations regarding this are inacurrate and actually inefficient at giving good description of quantum behaviour since most non physicists arent familiar with the properties of classical wave anyway and its mostly used when talking about the position of quantum particle ive never heard someone say that spin behaves like wave or like particle im looking for something more fundamental more universal that being said think its very important to include discussion about the relative phase between two superpositioned states as it leads to quantum interference perhaps the only wave like feature that applies throughout qm if there were only quantum superposition quantum computing would be pretty much useless even if we perform one billion calculations simultaneously when measuring the system we would get single random value our goal is to manipulate the system to create destructive interference between the unwanted results in order to increase the probability of measuring the desired value and that requires the notion of quantum phase uncertainty principle might be the toughest challenge here since we can get the basic idea without invoking qm at all first even in classical mechanics its impossible to measure something with an arbitrarily big precision simply because of instrumental limitations second of all it makes sense to get different results if we measure the position before or after the momentum xp neq since we interact with the system when making the first observation leaving it in different state afterward how could explain that there are more fundamental implications from qm wasnt sure about entanglement and quantization the weirdness of entanglement doesnt come from how we achieve it but from how we interpret it which is still an unresolved issue as far as know many world copenhagen interpretation etc as for the quantization of particle properties it doesnt seem like an intrinsic feature of qm more of consequence of boundary conditions free electron in vaccum has continuous energy spectrum its only when we put it in potential well that some states are forbidden not exactly forbidden of course even bohr explained the hydrogen atom in semi classical model using destructive interference between the state of the electron then there is also the quantization of matter itself photons electrons quarks etc which is another story but think most people are familiar with the idea that matter is made of atoms so it isnt far stretch to include light as well my point is that these two principles dont appear quite as essential as the other ones to understand qm havent found satisfying answer in the similar posts of this forum here here or here for instance since im more interested in the overall description of qm not just of wavefunctions or superposition and dont want to get into the motivations behind the theory also id like to give an accurate meaningful answer not one that leads directly to pseudoscientific interpretations of qm particles are waves and vice versa everything not forbidden is mandatory consciousness affects reality that kind of thing edit just to clarify my question perhaps here what would say concerning special relativity sr the basic assumption of sr is that everyone always sees light traveling at the same speed no matter what circumstances so far so good now imagine that im in train going at km and that throw ball in front of me at km from my perspective the ball is going at km but for you standing on the ground the ball is going at km with respect to you it all makes perfect sense since you have to consider the velocity of the train good now lets replace the ball with photon oh oh according to our previous assumption we will both see the photon travelling at the same speed even though am moving at km we cannot add my speed to your measurement as we did earlier this implies that we both perceive time and space differently boom and from this you can get to pretty much all of sr of course one should also mention that is the maximum speed this simple assumption implies the core of the theory what would be the equivalent in qm the little assumption that when accepted implies most of the theory emilio pisanty saw the post in your comment its one of the links at the end of mine as said im not interested in why we need qm want to know explain what fundamental assumption is necessary to build the theory however its true both questions are linked in some ways guess edit again im not interested in why we need qm its pretty obvious well turn to the theory that best describes our world want to explain what is qm basically its weird main features but qm has lot of weirdness so if simply describe the above phenomena one by one it doesnt reflect the essence of the theory as whole it just looks like patchwork theory where everyone added its magical part and know all about the qm postulates but those are more convention of how to do qm mathematical formalism well use hermitian matrix for observables well use wavefunction on complex hilbert space to represent particle and so on rather than description of what qm is about what happens in the quantum world what phenomena it correctly predicts no matter how counterintuitive to our classical minds edit thank you all for your contributions havent chosen an answer yet im curious to see if someone else will give it try theres little point want to stress many answers below give good description of the weird concepts of qm but my goal is to wrap it all up as much as possible to give an explanation where most of these are connected with as little assumptions as possible so far knzhous answer is the closest to what im looking for but im not entirely satisfied even though theres probably no answer good enough most answers are very close to the wave particle duality which im not fan of because people understand this as electrons are particles on week days and waves during the weekend however perhaps its unavoidable as it truly does include most of the phenomena listed above then thought perhaps if we were talking about quantum fields rather than waves of matter the discussion would be less likely to lead to misinterpretation also for all those who said well qm is just incomprehensible for lay people think thats giving up too easily and it feels little dishonest qm is not secret society for special elite think its important that researchers explain what is their goal and how they intend to achieve it to the general public think the 2nd question physicists are asked most often is why should my tax money pay for your work do you really think an answer such as well you couldnt understand it just trust me is satisfying qm is counterintuitive but well explained it can make sense and im just looking for the easiest way to make people realize this without simply saying well forget anything you know also think it is theory that would be much easier to accept if people were more often exposed to these ideas after all children and high school students learn that the world is made of atoms and they accept it even though they cannot see atoms why then couldnt qm be part of the common scientific culture its true it may sound ridiculous at first to hear about superposition and indeterminate states but it isnt by giving up and by saying well you need degree to understand it that we are going to change it and make it more appreciable

422570 thought vector field was function vec mathbb to mathbb which takes vector to vector this seemed intuitive to me but in mathematical physics course found the definition sum limits frac partial partial where seems to take functions from infty as argument and mathbb to mathbb dont understand this new way of talking about vector fields especially when our professor said we should see the frac partial partial as basis vectors of the tangent space also cant really translate any vector field which know into this new definition so it would be great if someone could maybe make an example of an vec field or something similar and translate it into this new way of expressing vector fields im also struggling to visualize the new definition it seems that xf mathbb to mathbb for in infty to which really cant assign any physical meaning tl dr can someone explain to me why someone would want to express vector field in this way ideally id like to see an example of the same vector field expressed in the two forms and an explanation how one would interpret the visualization of the new vector field

422975 as we know perturbative expansion of interacting qft or qm is not convergent series but an asymptotic series which generally is divergent so we cant get arbitrary precision of an interacting theory by computing higher enough order and adding them directly however we also know that we can use some resummation trick like borel summation pad approximation and so on to sum divergent series to restore original non perturbative information this trick is widely used in computing critical exponent of phi etc my questions although its almost impossible to compute perturbation to all order is it true that we can get arbitrary precision of interacting system like qcd by computing higher enough order and using resummation trick like borel summation is it true that in principle non perturbative information like instanton vortex can also be achieved by above methods there is solid example dim phi theory zg equiv int infty infty frac dx sqrt pi gx from the definition of zg above zg must be finite number for as usual we can compute this perturbatively zg int infty infty frac dx sqrt pi sum infty frac gx sim sum infty int infty infty frac dx sqrt pi frac gx tag note in principle we cant exchange integral and infinite summation its why asymptotic series is divergent zg sim sum infty frac 4n n16 2n tag its divergent asymptotic series in another way zg can be directly solved zg frac frac 8g frac 8g sqrt pi tag where nx is the modified bessel function of the second kind we see obviously that zg is finite for and is an essential singularity but we can restore the exact solution by borel resummation of divergent series first compute the borel transform bg sum infty frac 4n 2n frac 2k frac sqrt 4g sqrt 4g pi 4g where kx is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind then compute the borel sum bg int infty bgtdt frac frac 8g frac 8g sqrt pi tag bg zg we see concretely by using the trick of borel resummation we can restore the exact solution from divergent asymptotic series
423273 point charge is placed inside conducting spherical shell at random place non centre have read that there is no force on from the shell no matter where is inside the shell there will be large force from few electrons pulling the charge one way and smaller force but from more electrons pulling the charge the other way but have read that then the electric field from induces charge the electrons in the shell rearrange themselves to neutralise the electric field from after which will feel an attractive repelling force from the shell question how can there be force on the electrons in the shell from making them redistribute but no force on from the electrons in the shell is it true that charge inside conducting shell induces redistribution of charge on the shell it doesnt seem to make sense as the force per charge field inside the shell was zero before we added and then we put charge of 1q in there so should feel zero force from the shell
423406 we know via wiens law that body at 6000k emits an electromagnetic wave at the peak wavelength in the visible spectrum how come say the fluorescent tubes which also emit the em waves that we can see as visible not 6000k
423507 im just starting to learn general relativity gr and im beginner but came out with this situation which is unclear to me the trajectory of charged particle in gr is given from the equation dot mu gamma mu alpha beta alpha beta frac mu nu nu so if have neutral particle the equation reduces to the geodesic equation for free particle but because of the einstein maxwell equations mu nu frac mu nu em mu nu the em stress energy tensor determines the form of the metric and consequently the christoffel symbols that appears in the geodesic equation for the neutral particle so would the trajectory of this neutral particle in an em field be different from the case of space time with null em field
423632 bullet of mass travelling horizontally with speed of passes through the wooden block of mass kg initially at rest the bullet emerges with speed and the block slides cm before coming to rest find friction coefficient between block and surface my teacher solved this question by conserving momentum between the bullet and the block but how can he do that when there is external force friction acting on the system think impulse momentum theorem is used in such scenarios but how can apply it in this problem
423985 ive read about how sound propagation can be modeled as phonon particles moving and interacting understand that this is useful mathematical construct to describe the behavior of longitudinal pressure waves in medium like air are standard model particles actually matter in the same sense mundane stuff we can directly observe like the air molecules whose motion transmits sound mere models that describe possibly unknown mediums behavior like phonons or do we believe that at its fundamental level that all matter may be like the phonons in that its all just describing how some field or medium propagates energy as it gets beyond electrons protons and neutrons its not clear to me that the other particles exist rather than being models of how other things behave accept the math makes accurate predictions but its not clear to me that its not just like phonons that way

424499 suppose ball is going straight along fixed line without rotating now you consider point which is not along the trajectory of the ball if want to consider the angular momentum about that point as you can understand that the and vector arent in the same direction so times should have value so this object isnt rotating but has an angular momentum can conclude that the ball has angular momentum without rotating

424870 how does this formula work from dimensional analysis perspective text escape sqrt frac 2gm the way im thinking about it is that is in units text cdot text text kg you multiply by kilogram amount the mass to turn into units cdot text text kg you then divide by the radius of the object to turn into units cdot text text kg however text escape is in units text text sqrt cdot text text kg neq text text therefore how does the equation even work if the units on either side arent equal or am doing this all wrong
425013 according to wikipedia closed system is physical system that does not allow certain types of transfers such as transfer of mass and energy transfer in or out of the system according to my textbook the principle of conservation of charge is the algebraic sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is constant isnt this circular logic in terms of charge closed system is one in which charge can neither exit nor enter if the charge neither exits nor enters then of course the sum thereof stays constant or is the principle saying that the only way for the sum of charge in system to change is via transfer of charge in or out of the system in this case wouldnt it make more sense to state the principle as charge can neither be created nor destroyed
425246 am an ib student as such do not have an answer to the following question and while think have solved it when try to use other methods get different answers and counter intuitive solutions the question is two rockets and are moving towards each other on the same path from the frame of reference of earth an observer measures the speed of to be 6c and the speed of to be 4c according to the observer on earth the distance between and is cdot10 8m determine according to an observer in the time taken for to meet if the picture is needed will include it my initial solution my initial solution was to determine the gamma factor of in respect to the ground as gamma dfrac sqrt dfrac and as from the observer on the ground the time until the two meet is dfrac cdot10 4c thought good method was to use time dilation to say gamma where is the time observed from observer this gives dfrac this was what thought was the solution second solution my teacher gave the second solution as follows the distance observed between and from the perspective of is from length contraction dfrac cdot10 gamma cdot10 the relative velocity of observed from the perspective of is dfrac dfrac uv dfrac 4c 6c dfrac 6c cdot0 4c 806c thus the time observed from will under this approach dfrac cdot10 cdot3 cdot10 98s which is different from my initial approach however the problem with this approach is that when look from bs perspective the time will be longer than seconds which is observed on the ground may ask what is the correct way of doing it and why the other way is wrong
425649 in computer science we reference colours using the rgb system and tvs have pixels which consist of groups of red green and blue lines which turn on and off to create colours but how does this work why would certain amounts of red blue and green light make something seem yellow is this biological thing where our brain performs some kind of averaging operation or are the waves actually interacting to make light of new wavelength it seems rgb is universal triplet as every colour within the visible spectrum can be created by combining the three in different intensities is rgb the only such triplet if so why if not what features must triplet of colours have to be universal
425830 light is made up of photons they hit our eyes to create sensation suppose two points and are in very long distance apart in vacuum if we shine very weak light from point practical experience dictates that from point we would not perceive the same intensity of light if any if speed of light is constant shouldnt all the photons travel from to and thus the intensity remain the same note that they are in vacuum photons cannot hit something and change direction
425834 ive just started reading about photo electric effect here and my high school level understanding goes something like this by we had maxwell equations and treated light as wave but maxwell couldnt explain the graph of black body radiation the electrons in hot object can vibrate with range of frequencies ranging from very few vibrations per second to huge number of vibrations per second in fact there is no limit to how great the frequency can be classical physics said that each frequency of vibration should have the same energy since there is no limit to how great the frequency can be there is no limit to the energy of the vibrating electrons at high frequencies may know why how classical physics came up with the conclusion that each frequency of vibration should have the same energy intuitively feel the energy of mechanical wave depends on amplitude frequency how could the classical physics conclude all frequencies have same energy
426674 the speed of light is universal constant so we definitely know the speed of the photons if we know the speed then we should not have any information about their location because of heisenbergs uncertainty principle but im one hundred percent sure when light goes through my window why is this so
426744 if you horizontally throw sphere of radius it will feel in this direction drag force due to air assume the drag is given by stokes law pi eta where eta is the air viscosity and is the horizontal speed this force cannot see the internal structure of toy balloon football or even metal sphere however anyone who ever played with balls and toy balloons noticed that for the same throwing the ball will have higher horizontal reach for the same time interval just think about someone kicking toy balloons and footballs and the distances reached in each case how is the resistive force considerably greater for the toy balloon even if we consider quadratic drag bv suppose the coefficient would depend only on the fluid and the geometry of the bodies again the drag would be equal another way to put this question how does the density of the sphere contribute for the resistive force

426912 it is well established that the light speed in perfect vacuum is roughly times rm but it is also known that outer space is not perfect vacuum but hard vacuum so is the speed limit theoretically faster than what we can measure empirically because the hard vacuum slows the light down is this considered when measuring distances with light
426976 was watching the youtoube video how time becomes space inside black hole by pbs space time about how space and time flip within the event horizon the way the narrator seems to explain it the geometry of space and time become so warped in black hole that time can be traversed as it it were spatial dimension often times there are caveats or other things to consider when learning about physics through youtube videos so wanted to ask specific question here if were to fall below the event horizon of black hole with jetpack and flashlight could turn on the flashlight then use the jetpack to accelerate past those photons
427095 either large constrained cylinder of water or large volume of open water perhaps in the ocean could be persuaded to form vortex by pumping energy in the body of water would be acting as fluid version of flywheel storing energy if one then removed the input energy would the vortex continue for significant time or would it quickly lose all its energy by heating up the water would storing energy in the rotational kinetic energy of fluid be horribly inefficient compared to pumped hydro storage
427233 there are lots of posts about em wave model of photons but havent read one that covers the more specific question am focusing on here here how does energy transfer between and in an em standing wave david was concerned about the presence of zero field point in the wave close but that is not my concern an electromagnetic waves is propagated by the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields changing electric field produces changing magnetic field and changing magnetic field produces changing electric field an electromagnetic wave is self propagating and does not need medium to travel through but cant overcome the idea that in order to achieve propagation an dot or dot in one place must be capable of inducing dot or dot in different place how do we understand change in position to occur in maxwells vacuum equations such as nabla times dot does not curl result in vector located in the same place as suggesting that it is only at that point field may be induced we know that two different em waves interfere rather than interacting yet propagation seems to require that decaying em wave at one point interacts with and generates more of itself that is an em wave at another point somethings missing from the picture the rest of the post is just list of dead ends considered if dot resulted in distant dot or vice versa energy would need to be carried between the locations suppose this might be by propagating em wave however am trying to understand propagating em wave in the first place and it is difficult although not impossible to work with recursive or circular explaination if constant speed is assumed one can easily turn time dependent wave equation to space spatially dependent one however what im looking for is mechanism from which to derrive or at least justify propagation and the assumption of any speed essentially skips over that step matter waves such as on string exhibit clear coupling in the form of tension along the string although as they are fundamentally different kind of wave looking for something very similar to that may be flawed is there some conceptual aspect of field waves ive managed to miss or forget wonder maybe got it backwards and photon propagation is the evidence of to induction over distance havent got very far with that line of reasoning special relativity explains magnetic fields as the relativistic effect of charge motion always felt this was one of the greatest insights so started to wonder if there is any way to make use of it to develop an argument for motion of energy in an field must be googling the wrong keywords though another approach is to imagine that dot is equivalent to the motion of charge and then try to think about the field that moving charge would induce however fields being present omnidirectionally around the charge seems to make this impossible
427491 have read in this answer that to represent angular momentum as vector you need to use right hand rule this is annoying because physics at ordinary scales is reflection invariant but people do this to avoid tensors because they have more intuition for vectors in which way does the right hand rule achieve this mapping to vectors
427827 paper is an extremely flexible material at least when it is in sheet form it will deform significantly according to the pressure applied and it is easy to fold therefore its extremely counterintuitive that sheet of paper could cut through human skin and probably through stiffer harder materials since when the skin applies pressure on the paper one would expect it to fold or bend yet it is easy to have severe cut from paper through both the epidermis and the dermis how is that possible certainly the width of the sheet of paper plays big role the smaller it is the sharper it is but also the more flexible it becomes and the less it should sustain an applied pressure without folding up can think of other materials such as thin plastic films and aluminium foils my intuition tells me the plastic foil would not cut through skin but the aluminium foil would although am not sure since did not try the experiment if this hold true what determines whether material would be able to cut through skin hair for example which is flexible and thinner than paper sheet is unable to cut through the skin what makes paper stand out what is so different that makes it good cutter maybe it has to do with its microscopic properties and that it contains many fibers but highly doubt it because the aluminium foil does not contain these and yet would probably also cut
427922 have recently read that helium is going to be used as coolant in generation iv nuclear reactors because helium is radiologically inert it does not easily participate in nuclear processes and does not become radioactive source ch of the impact of selling the federal helium reserve does that mean if there would be some helium leaks it would not pollute the air also how is that some gas conduct radioactivity more than others how is that determined have read something about cross sectional area of nuclei with barns as unit but dont really understand the process what are some other gases which are radiologically inert

428033 in pauli1973 wave mechanics pauli lectures on physics volume he derives on page the schr dinger equation similar to tong lectures on qft nabla psi frac 2m frac partial psi partial frac frac partial psi partial the last term vanishes in the limit rightarrow infty and makes the following peculiar remark aside from the imaginary coefficient it corresponds to the equation of heat conduction the imaginary coefficient assures that there is no special direction in time is invariant under the transformation rightarrow psi rightarrow psi whereby psi psi remains unchanged what does he mean by the imaginary coefficient assures there is no special direction in time does the real heat equation without imaginary coefficient have special direction in time what does direction mean forward or backward or direction angle relative to space pretty confused but knowing pauli his remarks usually hold some deep insights would like to understand
428148 the electromagnetic field produces gravitational field because the em field tensor produces stress energy which in turn produces gravitational field via the einstein field equations this would seem to imply that particular arrangement of current and voltage could be used to generate an electromagnetic field configuration which would in turn produce gravity on demand is this actually possible

428525 so the formula for work is left text work right left text force right times left text distance right im trying to get an understanding of how this represents energy if im in vacuum and push block with force of mathrm it will move forwards infinitely so as long as wait long enough the distance will keep increasing this seems to imply that the longer wait the more work energy has been applied to the block must be missing something but cant really pinpoint what it is it only really seems to make sense when think of the opposite scenario when slowing down block that is initially going at constant speed

428990 the euler lagrange equation gives the equations of motion of system with lagrangian let alpha represent the generalized coordinates of configuration manifold represent time the lagrangian is function of the state of particle the particles position alpha and velocity dot alpha the euler lagrange equation is frac dt frac partial partial dot alpha frac partial partial alpha why is this law of physics and not simple triviality for any function on the variables alpha and dot alpha the following proof of the lagrange equation uses no physics and seems to suggest that the lagrange equation is simply mathematical fact that works for every function begin align frac dt frac partial partial dot alpha frac partial partial dot alpha frac dl dt text commutativity of derivatives frac partial dot partial dot alpha frac partial partial alpha text cancellation of dots end align this cant be right or else nobody would give hoot about this equation and it would be totally useless to solve any problem what is wrong with the logical reasoning above
429213 how does particle know it should behave in such and such manner as person can set mass is so and so charge is so and so then set up equation to solve its equation of motion but who computes that equation of motion for particle in real life as person employ smart tricks such as principle of superposition to avoid having to calculate super complicated situation calculating electrical force by shape where large circle is hollowed out in the off center but if were to calculate this in brute force manner this would take long time for me to calculate however nature doesnt seem to face these types of problems given school of fish the ones at the edge will sense threat and gives signal to those near them and so on but this analogy doesnt seem to make sense for physical objects generally considered in general physics problems am asking the wrong type of question would appreciate input on this

429471 from the escape velocity formula sqrt frac 2gm some sources say it is the distance between two objects with mass and some examples have read only used radius of the for simplicity sake lets use rocket and planet earth google the escape velocity of earth as km looked through example such as this this particular example said that the escape velocity is begin align sqrt 2gr sqrt times9 mathrm times6 times10 mathrm km mathrm km end align do know that frac gm but in this example the escape velocity is calculated using as radius of earth the radius of the earth according to google is km or 4e6 the value used for the calculation my question is the radius of of the earth or the distance between the rocket and earth what think makes sense is the radius of the earth because how could escape velocity be calculated without knowing the height it has to travel to add about the info distance from and some sources say that is actually mathrm atmosphere
429495 read the following from wikipedia when string is plucked normally the ear tends to hear the fundamental frequency most prominently but the overall sound is also colored by the presence of various overtones frequencies greater than the fundamental frequency when pluck string just notice node at each end and an antinode at the middle how can we have overtones in addition to the fundamental frequency it seems counterintuitive for me

429708 it seems impossible yet im thinking that maybe because the ball compresses against the bat bit it acts little like spring and does travel faster than the bat edit this is just clarification and not really part of the question but think it may be valuable for people saying momentum is conserved im not sure what you are imagining but take moment to think about the equation you keep on mentioning textrm bat textrm bat textrm ball textrm ball this is saying that the bat somehow transfers all of its momentum to the ball the only way this can ever happen is if the bat comes to dead stop when it hits the ball somehow holds it in place while transferring all of its momentum to it that phrase doesnt even make logical sense and then the ball flies off at much larger velocity were the bat floating through space and struck ball the bat would not stop when it hits the ball and there is no way it makes sense for the ball to go off at that much of larger velocity just imagine spaceship very slowly drifting through space and an astronaut who suddenly touches it conservation of momentum does not mean textrm ship textrm ship textrm astronaut textrm astronaut according to that the astronaut would shoot off at hundreds maybe thousands of kilometers per hour when being touched by massive spaceship and the spaceship would come to stop but obviously that doesnt happen total momentum is conserved so that textrm ship1 textrm ship1 textrm astronaut1 textrm astronaut1 textrm ship2 textrm ship2 textrm astronaut2 textrm astronaut2 but even that equation doesnt even apply in the case of the baseball strike since there is human being providing force even as the bat hits the ball know this is ingrained deeply in the minds of physics students because we have conservation of momentum drilled into our heads as young students in introductory physics but encourage everyone to always think intuitively about physics scenarios before applying equations anyways hope that was valuable cheers
429874 im repeating myself lot here but its because want to make my confusion clear if billiard balls are the same exact mass and one hits another stationary one head on have heard that the hitting ball will often stop entirely while the one which got hit will go off at the original velocity of the first one ignoring friction and heat and other potential loss of energy understand that this agrees with conservation of momentum however now that am thinking about it am little confused as to how it is possible consider lets say we have balls ball and ball the balls have equal mass ball is the hitting ball with an original velocity of and ball is getting hit originally stationary once ball hits ball it immediately starts accelerating it at the same rate that it decelerates in other words ball exerts the same force on ball that ball exerts on ball in this way momentum is conserved so that for any amount of momentum that ball gains ball loses to to thats just newtons third law since they have the same mass ball will decelerate at the same rate ball accelerates however after certain amount of time both balls will have the same amount of momentum in the same direction that is ball will have been decelerated to and ball will have been accelerated to ball and ball at this point of equal momentum must have the same velocity since they have the same mass now the only way for ball to exert force on ball is for them to be in contact however the instant after they gain the same velocity the balls would no longer be in contact as ball would now be moving away from ball or at least at the same rate as ball that being said it seems impossible that ball would ever become faster than ball since ball would only be able to be accelerated up to the point where it is going at the same velocity as ball and it seems even more impossible for ball to stop completely and ball to go off at the original velocity of ball what am missing edit after reading some scrupulous comments not in bad way though love it when there are new variables introduced and things pointed out and all the what if questions allways make for awesome discussion thanks for the comments ive realized its better to imagine the billiard balls as floating through space than on pool table to get rid of the possibility that spin will affect the collision or we could just imagine frictionless pool table but better to imagine them floating through space because everyone loves space
429942 in this paper bell derives his famous inequality using the assumtions of locality and realism in order to understand how the locality assumption affects the derivation of the inequality and why it is needed for the equality have attempted to re derive the inequality first assuming locality and then second time assuming nonlocality to see what the difference is however my derivations seem to say that there is no difference which implies that nonlocality cannot be concluded from bell test which is wrong or some other smarter mathematician would have pointed it out by now where am making my mistakes note know there are other similar questions regarding nonlocality in the chsh inequality have read them and dont see their application to this the original form of bells inequality they use different mathematical formalism and expression which do not see appear in bells original derivation the system is pair of entangled particles let pm be the result of alices measurement of one particles spin and let pm be the result of bobs measurement of the others let mathbf alpha and mathbf beta be unit vectors representing alice and bobs measurement directions respectively let lambda represent set of any number of hidden variables and rho rho lambda the normalized probability distribution of lambda as far as can tell the locality assumption amounts to assuming that mathbf alpha lambda neq mathbf alpha mathbf beta lambda or that is independent of mathbf beta and likewise for and mathbf alpha this may be my mistake if there is more to it than this local derivation mathbf alpha lambda pm mathbf beta lambda pm the expectation value of ab is begin equation mathbf alpha mathbf beta int rho mathbf alpha lambda mathbf beta lambda lambda end equation for given measurement direction mathbf begin equation mathbf mathbf int rho mathbf lambda mathbf lambda lambda implies mathbf lambda mathbf lambda end equation mathbf mathbf implies that the particles are anticorrelated and so by rewriting the expectation value of as begin equation mathbf alpha mathbf beta int rho mathbf alpha lambda mathbf beta lambda lambda tag end equation in other words by assuming mathbf alpha lambda mathbf beta lambda is always valid we mathematically represent the assumption that the state of our two particle system is restricted to maximally anticorrelated state psi pm rangle using this last expression we get for some unit vectors mathbf mathbf and mathbf begin align mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf int rho big mathbf lambdaa mathbf lambda mathbf lambda mathbf lambda big lambda int rho mathbf lambdaa mathbf lambda big frac mathbf lambda mathbf lambda mathbf lambdaa mathbf lambda big lambda int rho mathbf lambdaa mathbf lambda big mathbf lambda mathbf lambda big lambda end align begin equation mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf leq int rho big mathbf lambdaa mathbf lambda big lambda mathbf mathbf end equation begin equation mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf leq end equation nonlocal derivation mathbf alpha mathbf beta lambda pm mathbf beta mathbf alpha lambda pm the expectation value of ab is begin equation mathbf alpha mathbf beta int rho mathbf alpha mathbf beta lambda mathbf beta mathbf alpha lambda lambda end equation begin equation mathbf mathbf int rho mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda lambda implies mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda end equation begin equation mathbf alpha mathbf beta int rho mathbf alpha mathbf beta lambda mathbf beta mathbf alpha lambda lambda tag end equation begin align mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf int rho big mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda big lambda int rho mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda big frac mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda big lambda end align begin equation mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf leq int rho big mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda big lambda end equation begin equation mathbf mathbf mathbf mathbf int rho big mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda big lambda leq end equation question my result is of the same form as bells but cannot simplify the third term on the left to mathbf mathbf so the third term retains its nonlocal dependence on second argument despite this both int rho big mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda mathbf mathbf lambda big lambda and mathbf mathbf are restricted to the range leq leq so both inequalities should lead to the same experimental conclusions regarding local realism so what difference does the locality assumption make what assumption am misrepresenting or what other mistake am making
429998 by definition pressure is the perpendicular force applied to unit area so it has direction which is perpendicular to the area so it should be vector but did sone googling and found out that it is scalar quantity so it would really be helpful if someone could show me how pressure is scalar with some mathematical derivation
430419 in newtonian gravity an infinite volume filled with uniform distribution of mass would be in perfect equilibrium at every point the gravitational forces contributed by masses in one direction would be exactly counterbalanced by those in the opposite direction but when einstein tried to apply general relativity to possible cosmologies he found it necessary to include the cosmological constant in order to get static universe in qualitative terms it seems to me that the gravitational stresses that the masses would impose on the spacetime should all cancel out and likewise that the resulting flat spacetime should have no effect on the motion of the masses however the math of the situation is beyond my current skills so im asking how it produces the nonequilibrium condition realize that such an equilibrium solution might not be stable and that there are many other very good reasons to believe in an expanding universe so im not trying to promote any alternative theories im just curious about this particular point
430791 am familiar with the usual derivation of the fact that it is impossible for someone to observe an object enter black hole because of the fact that light gets infinitely redshifted as its source gets closer and closer to the event horizon but one thing that bothers me is when you think of the problem backwards if emit photon from infinitely far away in the direction of the black hole then when it gets to the event horizon it will be infinitely blueshifted from the perspective of stationary observer just above the horizon so it means that the measured energy for the photon will be infinite my question than is whether this simple thought experiment has some implication regarding the geometry around the black hole since this new energy would be new source for curvature know this might be related to some formal problems regarding black hole scattering and things like that but would first like to hear more conceptual take on this edit someone has pointed this question as possible duplicate of what will the universe look like for anyone falling into black hole but dont think that addresses exactly the point am raising here am more interested in whether there would be room for physical consequence caused by the blueshift that light suffers when approaching black hole regarding things like curvature etc
431010 recently read this article which claims that last year ligo observation of gravitational waves is proof that at least on massive scales there cannot be more than three spatial dimensions don understand the physics fully so could someone please explain this to me know it been theorized that gravity is relatively weak when compared to other forces because it leeches into other dimensions and think understand how these observations disprove that but how does this prove that there must be three and only three spatial dimensions
431482 know that at home the electric circuits are parallel and this explains why if one appliance eg bulb fails everything else continues to work but if more devices are added in parallel to each other their combined resistance should decrease and thus the total power supplied by them should increase as mathrm power it doesnt look like thats the case what am getting wrong

431564 have been studying symmetries in quantum mechanics and have come across two types given some transformation on hilbert space of states mathcal an operator mathcal rightarrow mathcal is symmetry operator if dagger where is the hamiltonian of the system symmetry transformation is either unitary or anti unitary operator on mathcal wigners theorem are these two definitions of symmetry equivalent
431565 so im going through my notes and think ive confused myself we often imply psi rangle to psix langle psi to psix for instance when we talk about eigenvalue equations we interpret hat psi rangle psi rangle as simply hat psix psix but dont understand why we say psi rangle to psix because if that was the case then langle psi psi rangle psi when clearly langle psi psi rangle int infty infty psi dx im obviously missing something simple could anyone point out where im going wrong

431861 quoting from the feynman lectures on physics vol the atoms are or times rm cm in radius now rm cm is called an angstrom just as another name so we say they are or angstroms in radius another way to remember their size is this if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple how does this hold true let us assume the radius of an average apple is about rm cm rm the radius of earth is about rm km rm therefore frac mathrm mathrm magnification magnification of about times is required to magnify an apple to the size of the earth if we magnify an atom of size say angstrom rm by times we get rm or rm cm only the atom has not been magnified to the size of the original apple how does the quoted statement in the book hold good
432137 the nobel prize in physics was awarded recently with half going to arthur ashkin for his work on optical tweezers and half going to rard mourou and donna strickland for developing technique called chirped pulse amplification in general optical tweezers are relatively well known but chirped pulse amplification is less well understood on broader physics or optics context while normally the wikipedia page is reasonable place to turn to in this case its pretty technical and flat and not particularly informative so what is chirped pulse amplification what is the core of the method that really makes it tick what pre existing problems did its introduction solve what technologies does it enable and what research fields have become possible because of it

432798 assume you wanted to build particle accelerator in non commerical non residential area it costs more money the deeper you want to build it therefore you want to build it as close to ground level as possible why arent particle accelerators built on ground level what is the shallowest depth at which particle accelerators can be feasibly built and what are the equations such as synchrotron radiation or luminosity interference or at least the phenomena and not necessarily the equations behind them that determine this my speculation some situation forgot where and when in which stray particle from an accelerator hit someone ended in them from the effects of being by high energy hadron also fermilab researcher who taught one of my classes told us about one of the times in which some loose particles found their way out of the accelerator and shot an inches wide hole through steel beam in fraction of fraction of second now doubt the particle accelerator engineers sat down in conference and said we must build them below ground or else particles beams could tear through people but this is the only drawback know of that comes with ground level accelerator it can accidentally release fairly high energy particles that can hit things solar radiation might also have notable effects but am not sure
433017 have small youtube channel in which make videos about topics relating science and things find interesting the topic im working on recently is on the color of the sun what thought at the start was going to be an easy topic to tackle has turned into something little more complex and with more nuances now will make some statements that have infer from my little investigation feel free to challenge any so can get to the bottom of this all stars emit light in the full light spectrum depending on the temperature of the star it will emit certain wavelengths of light much more than others we perceive the mixture of many colors as white or more precisely the mixture of green blue and red light in roughly equal amounts well certainly our sun does not emit equal amount of red light than of blue or green but seen from the space the sun appears as white even though it emits little more green light than any other wavelength so assume there is certain threshold in which our eyes does not perceive the difference so they see just white now how often are stars like this if we look at any other star in the space and with the naked eye assuming we wouldnt mind burning our retina will we just see white light have some stars in the universe blackbody curve skewed enough so we would be able to see them in any particular color
433334 know this is probably common point of confusion but have specific question about measurements in quantum mechanics read an explanation on this but still have point of confusion the explanation of why measurement somehow affects what occurs in quantum experiment for example the double slit experiment seems to be that by measuring even just by watching we interact with the system and cause the wave function to collapse but it seems to me with such broad definition of measurement all particles everywhere in the universe would in some small way be measured at any given instance this answer explains that light is form of measurement but light after all is not the only way to perform measurements as we very often measure things purely with gravity and would all particles in the universe not be subject to and the source of some trace amount of gravity or have some interaction with some other particle in some way shape or form it seems like the answer would be yes so it seems like we would never be able to observe an experiment without that collapse with measurements in quantum mechanics interactions per se why are they not always occurring
433427 ive been wondering this for while but have not yet encountered an explanation this is from my understanding of physics which is by no means expert so sorry for my crude explanation energy within earth can be considered closed system it transforms but cannot be created or destroyed and from what understand heat seems to be its most natural form so it will always end up like that in some way two things affect the total sum of energy on earth radiation into space will drain energy and is limited because of the presence of atmosphere radiation from the sun adds energy to the system basically the sun is our only real source of energy and we can consider it limitless since when the sun is exhausted were over anyway the way understand it solar panels increase the efficiency of how we harvest this solar energy reflecting less of it back into space and turning more of it into en energy in this case electrical so we take more energy from the sun by putting solar panels in place but the amount of energy that is removed from the system stays the same hence the total sum of energy on earth increases more when we use solar panels so how come we consider them to be way to counter global warming instead of contributing factor edit since all answers are about comparing solar cells to fossil fuels let me clarify bit more understand that fossil fuels will contribute more to climate change than solar cells but just wanted to clarify that is seems to me that both are net negative not if you replace one by the other in other words that the idea that solar cells are clean apart from production cost is not really true then wind of hydro however would be since they use energy that is already present in the earth system and of course what we really need to do is require less energy
433440 let us consider bipartite system in an entangled mixed state since its density matrix can always be diagonalized we can write it in following ways rho ab sum psi rangle langle psi sum ik ik rangle langle otimes rangle langle tag1 where psi rangle is an orthonormal basis in ab otimes and orthonoral bases in and are given by rangle and rangle one may obtain reduced density matrices for subsystems and rho mathrm tr rho ab sum ik ik rangle langle qquad rho sum ik ik rangle langle tag so my question is given the spectra sets of eigenvalues of rho and rho is it in general possible to recover the spectrum of rho ab if not then is there any physical intuition behind this result can this result be generalized for any multipartite system as toy model considered mathrm dim and mathrm dim once applying and and taking into account the fact that traces of all the density matrices have arrived to system of equations with number of unknowns larger than number of independent equations so unless am missing some other constrains this task seems to have no solution in general edit want to fix points mentioned by emilio pisanty and luzanne quad at least one thing that have overlooked is that for arbitrary orthonormal basis psi rangle expression rho ab sum psi rangle langle psi doesnt have to be given by diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on its diagonal yet as believe there always exists such an orthonormal basis that satisfies aforementioned condition for instance we can take for psi rangle column with only th element being nonzero and equal to quad now we define orthonormal bases rangle and rangle in exactly the same manner thenit seems to me we do have the following connection psi rangle ik rangle otimes rangle where dont imply summation over and ik for every combination of ik and for this highly specific choice of bases should hold still imply that my reasoning about recovery of rho ab from rho and rho should hold because set of eigenvalues doesnt depend on choice of basis density matrix is completely defined by set of eigenvalues

434180 im software developer interested in learning quantum mechanics to simulate chemistry know its very difficult topic so consider it long term someday maybe goal and not sure its even possible ive listened to some video lectures in introductory qm courses like susskinds and brant carlsons youtube videos and the content so far seems far removed from computing chemistry things like electron orbital shapes or bond energies is it possible to simulate the time evolution of something simple like the colliding and reacting molecules in mathrm mathrm rightarrow mathrm 2o mean simulate from first principles pure quantum mechanics without any estimates like pretend this atom is mass on spring etc if it is possible what is rough outline of the college courses required to go from point to from intro quantum mechanics to the understanding needed to write code for that simulation maybe its less about the physics and more about tricky computational techniques of estimating solutions to equations
434320 have read this question why cant we feel the earth turning my question is different because that question does not talk about only the comments the fact that think matters most that the earths rotation or the person on the surface is an accelerated frame the answers and comments to that question talk about comparing the feeling to traveling in ship with constant speed that is an inertial frame of reference my question is about why we do not feel being accelerated in the non inertial frame of reference on the surface of earth rotating where wouter says know its very late in the game for this question but this is partly biology question we dont feel the rotation of the earth because our brains are biased they evolved that way its not useful to experience be aware of this rotation day by day in the same way it isnt useful to be aware of gravity and where dan says because the rotation of the earth is very smooth and doesnt change the centripetal acceleration we feel is very nearly constant this means that the small centrifugal force from the rotation gets added to gravity to make up the background force we dont notice and this https www sciencealert com here why we don feel earth rotation according to science where it says so why cant we all feel it the answer lies in the nature of earths movement think of being on an aeroplane when its smoothly travelling at constant speed and constant altitude youve unbuckled your seatbelt to go on walk down the aisle but you cant feel the movement of the plane the reason is simple you the plane and everything else inside it is travelling at the same speed in order to perceive the movement of the plane you have to glance at the clouds outside so this one is saying that we dont feel it because like in an aeroplane we move with the plane so this is our inertial frame of reference but the plane is moving with constant speed in this example believe it is not ok to compare it to the rotation of the earth because the earths spin is an angular momentum and though the angular momentum itself is constant this is considered acceleration so any point or person on the surface of the earth is accelerating now one answer says that we do not feel it because our brain is used to the acceleration the other one says it is because the angular momentum of the earth is constant which one is right do not understand is it because there is no change in the acceleration or is it because our brain is used to it or is it because the centripetal force is so little compared to gravity question why do we really not feel the angular momentum of the earth is it because there is no change in the acceleration or is it because our brain is used to it or is it because the centripetal force is so little compared to gravity even if the acceleration is not changing the person on the surface is in non inertial reference frame how cant we feel this acceleration the equivalence principle only goes for gravity and the acceleration and as per gr we would not know the difference between them but we would still feel it

434492 according to my textbooks unit vector has no units and no dimensions but is only used to specify direction it only shows the orientation of corresponding vector in space think its true or thats what it looks like it makes sense because unit vector is defined as vector divided by its magnitude since we have the same numerical value in numerator and the denominator unit vector has magnitude of unit likewise we have the same unit in both numerator and the denominator that makes unit vector unitless and hence dimensionless thats why think unit vector has no dimensions please correct me if im wrong but another question naturally comes to our mind why if say force of due east or displacement of 1m noe both force and displacement are vector quantities and both have magnitude of unit in the above two examples my question is can we call these two unit vectors thats what im struggling to understand theres no reason why we cant call these two unit vectors because both have magnitude of unit and both are vectors however both have units and hence both are not dimensionless
434634 have been on date recently and everything went fine until the moment the girl has told me that the earth is flat after realizing she was not trolling me and trying to provide her with couple of suggestions why that may not be the case ive faced arguments of the like well you have not been to the space yourself that made me think of the following myself am certain that the earth is ball shaped and trust the school physics but being kind of scientist could not help but agree with her that some of the arguments that had in mind were taken by me for granted hence have asked myself how can prove to myself that the earth is indeed ball shaped as opposed to being flat circle around which the moon and the sun rotate in convenient for this girl manner question ideally want to have proof that would not require travelling more than couple of kilometers but am fine with using any convenient day if we need to wait for some eclipse or moon phase for example jump an plane and fly around the earth would not work for me whereas look at the moon what it is in phase and check the shape of the shade would trick is know that it is rather easy to verify local curvature of the earth by moving away from tall object in the field sitting on the beach and watching some big ship going to the horizon however to me that does not prove immediately that globally the earth has same similar curvature for example maybe its just shape of hemisphere so want to prove to myself that the earth is ball shaped globally and dont want to move much to do this help me or tell me that this is not possible and why please as an example most of the answers in this popular thread only focus on showing the local curvature think asking how to use physics to derive global characteristics of an object from observing things only locally with the help of the sun and the moon of course is valid question but if something can be improved in it feel free to tell me thanks update have not expected such great and strong feedback when asking this question even though it is indeed different from the linked ones them are still very similar which was not grasped by all those who replied will thoroughly go over all the answers to make sure which one fits the best but in the meantime if you would like to contribute please let me clarify couple of things regarding this question they were in the op but perhaps can be made more obvious do not have goal of proving something to this date see that mentioning her might have been confusing yet before this meeting was certain about the shape of the earth but her words even though think shes incorrect in her beliefs made me realize that my certainty was based on the assumption have not really questioned so sitting on beach with another friend of mine both being ball believers we thought of simple check to confirm our certainty rather than to convince anyone else in us being right am only looking for the check that would confirm the global shape of the earth being ball like there were several brilliant answers to another question that worked as local curvature proof and am not interested in them am looking for the the answer that will show that the earth is ball shaped or rather an ellipsoid not that it is not flat there are many other great shapes being neither ball ellipsoid nor flat do still have an assumption that this shape is convex otherwise things can go too wild and projections on the moon would not help us think point shows why is that valid physics astronomy question rather than playing devils advocate defending the flat earth hypothesis and would also happily accept the answer like you cannot show this by not moving for 20k kilometers because if theres indeed no simple proof at the same time points and should distinguish this question from the linked ones

434683 in his introduction to thermophysics daniel schroeder writes the following about the process in heat engine only part of the energy absorbed as heat can be converted to work the reason is that the heat as it flows in brings along entropy which must somehow be disposed of before the cycle can start over to get rid of the entropy every heat engine must dump some waste heat into its environment why must the extra entropy be disposed in my understanding we could gather more and more extra entropy while converting all the heat into work until the entropy reaches its maximum then state of equilibrium would be reached and no more energy could be withdrawn from the system according to the second law of thermodynamics but then we could just go to the next machine and do the same always converting all heat into work

435404 if we have two lasers based at the equator and we direct one of them east and the other west on to two screens each km away will light emitted synchronously at the lasers arrive at the same time as each other on thier respective screens my interest is that one laser moves with the rotation of the earth and the other one the opposite from what know the light shouldnt be affected by the rotation of the earth so the laser on the west side will arrive faster than the east side since the screen on the west side will come to the laser reference point correct me if im wrong with mathematics if you can

435523 we all know the following universal truth since childhood earth and other planets orbits around the sun and while was reading this post found that the reason behind earth revolution is chiefly due to one force gravitational pull some physicists explains the movement of earth around the sun on the basis of the following image as we can see the initial state of rock is rest and when we apply force it starts moving in circular path now my question is from where the earth had got the inertia of motion as the rock in the above example was initially at rest and so the earth should also be in state of rest without any force applied on it

436221 inspired by this question about whether dark matter is matter noting that dark matter tends to be clumped in galaxies near the center and less so on the edges accepting that many most galaxies have large black holes at their center and theoretically black holes have infinite gravity could black holes actually be the dark matter that holds galaxies together put another way how do we model the infinite gravity of black hole when considering the dynamics of galaxy
436462 in quantum mechanics operators can only be observables if the eigenfunctions they operate on have real eigenvalues if they are complex am told that surely some observable of physical system cannot be an imaginary number this makes some innate sense to me but feel am forced to acknowledge the real ness of imaginary numbers for instance an eigenstate to the infinite square well cannot be described without complex time but why are we forced to recognize the significance of complex numbers here and refuse it for something like an eigenvalue when im doing math real and complex numbers are just elements of field yet when were dealing with real life observables reals are then given some new preference why is this it seems like were using complex numbers when its convenient and then saying that they dont exist beyond mathematical trickery
436475 studying the basic concepts of fluid mechanics applied to pressure gauges and looking at schematics in many places question came into my mind where is the right place to put the pressure gauge to measure the pressure of tank the first case would be if the tank contains gas in this situation engels fluid mechanics book clarified it to me since the gravitational effects of gases are negligible the pressure anywhere in the tank and at position has the same value thus can put it anywhere in the tank if it contains gas the second case would be if the tank contains liquid especially when the tank is large in this situation the decision that seems more logical to me is to put the pressure gauge in the bottom of the tank however in all the places that looked the point was the chosen one to measure pressure as shown in the images below in points and which believe that gives the average pressure of the tank because the point is located at height of its geometric center average frac1h cdot int gamma dh frac gamma images sources mathalino pennstate college of engineering mne the sensorsguide university of sydney mdp sciencestruck chegg so where is the right place to put it to measure pressure of tank why the points were chosen instead of the botton of their tanks to calculate the pressure in the images above related questions why textbooks use geometric center centerline of the pipe when calculating measuring pressure why using average pressure in calculations gives the most accurate results
436747 whenever measure positive quantity volume there is some uncertainty related to the measurement the uncertainty will usually be quite low lower than depending on the equipment however have recently seen uncertainties due to extrapolation larger than the measurements which seems counter intuitive since the quantity is positive so my questions are do uncertainties larger than the measurements make sense or would it be more sensible to enforce an uncertainty cut off no higher than the measurement the word measurement might be poorly chosen in this context if we are including extrapolation
436972 when one first encounters quantum mechanics he learns about bohrs model of the hydrogen atom and one of his biggest problems electrons were accelerating and not emitting em radiation which is sometimes referred to as radiation friction then when you solve schr dingers equation with the following hamiltonian frac 2m frac pi varepsilon you get stationary states of the electron eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian and no radiation friction is emitted however solving this hamiltonian classically also doesnt give any evidence for radiation friction because it doesnt describe the interaction between the electron and the em field so my question is why is this hamiltonian taken to explain the lack of radiation friction in qm whereas in classical electrodynamics it is an invalid hamiltonian for that exact same reason hope my question was clear thank you

438222 im newbie reading quantum mechanics from inroduction to quantum meachanics by griffiths and in the early pages of the book the author defines langle rangle int infty infty psixt dx int infty infty psi psi dx langle rangle frac dt left langle rangle right frac hbar int infty infty psi frac partial psi partial dx langle rangle langle rangle hbar int infty infty psi frac partial psi partial dx so to me the author seems to be working out with expectations which made perfect sense to me then googled the expression for kinetic energy and was expecting to find out that langle rangle frac langle rangle 2m but instead it seems that langle rangle frac langle rangle 2m why is this dont understand what happened in the case of kinetic energy why isnt the author now working with expected momentum in the case of expected kinetic energy can you perhaps show me derivation of langle rangle and more importantly explanation on why it is done like that in the book the author says that generally langle qx rangle int psi qx frac hbar frac partial partial psi dx with advising that every should be replaced with frac hbar frac partial partial when calculating the expectation of interest the why part for this was however bit non existing
438370 am stuck in question where energy conservation is failing and momentum conservation is correct think might be doing something wrong thats why im asking this question the problem is as follows bullet of mass is fired horizontally into ballistic pendulum of mass kg and gets embedded in it if the centre of pendulum rises by distance of cm find the speed of the bullet verma centre of mass q47 let the mass of the bullet be let the mass of the pendulum be kg let the peak height be let the initial and final velocities be and respectively method momentum conservation mu mv implies frac mu text also frac mv mgh implies biggl frac biggr 2gh implies sqrt2 text method energy conservation since both the masses move together after the collision and because the velocity at highest point is null therefore frac mu frac mv mgh implies 2gh biggl frac biggr implies sqrt to summarize myself am curious about the following why do the results differ shouldnt the energy be conserved as well as the momentum since it should be then what is the flaw in my calculations

439235 it is well known from noethers theorem how from continuous symmetries in the lagrangian one gets conserved charge which corresponds to linear momentum angular momentum for translational and rotational symmetries and others is there any elementary argument for why linear or angular momentum specifically and not other conserved quantities are conserved which does not require knowledge of lagrangians by elementary mean if this is not so then this unreasonable thing occurs of course we can say if we want our laws to be the same at different point in space then linear conservation must be conserved but can we derive mathematically the expression for the conserved quantity without using the lagrangian want to explain to friend why they are conserved but he doesnt have the background to understand the lagrangian formalism
439268 why cant we use the positrons let off by beta plus radiation as source of anti matter such that we can collide it with an electron for efficient mass to energy conversion
439325 change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted undiminished to all points in the fluid pressure change occurring anywhere in confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere im having hard time getting the intuition behind pascals law ive already read many kinds of explanations involving energy work and displacement and read almost all the posts on this subject on physics se but cant convince myself the main problems for me are to understand the force amplification as consequence of pascals law and the reason why the pressure is transmitted undiminished made drawing to illustrate whats going on in my mind where the balls represent atoms assumptions in this post the fluid is incompressible and non viscous the container is perfectly rigid there are no displacements involved emphasize this assumption because many of the explanations read end up using the hydraulic press and ending with the argument you have to pay for the multiplied output force by exerting the smaller input force through larger distance like these ones on physics se force amplification and newtons third law and what is the explanation of pascals law at molecular level so in more explicit way pascals law says what happen but want to know why it happen in terms of forces at molecular level how pressure is transmitted undiminished to all points in the fluid causing the amplification of the force when area increases bbox 5pxborder 1px solid black top xrightarrow uparrow bottom in terms of energy how does the energy associated with the force applied at the top spreads and turns into the force applied at the bottom note know that energy given my assumptions is conserved note just to remember there are no displacements involved bbox 5pxborder 1px solid black top rightarrow top bottom rightarrow bottom
439511 its definitely possible to propel your body using muscle to move towards the ground quicker than gravity but is it possible to squat quicker than gravity assuming squatting from your knees and not you bending down from your back like lever and that youre not gripping the ground with your feet and pulling your self down if you dropped basketball from the same height as your head would it be possible to squat below the basket ball before the basket ball hit the ground
439604 we will always be able to see the cosmic microwave background cmb at about the age of the universe light years away always does that mean that infinite photons were created at that time if not how can we keep receiving new light from that event
439948 just wondering if the earths gravity affects the photons we can obviously think about equivalent mass of photons by using de broglie relation and then use it to calculate force of gravitational interaction but still this thought is very revolting help would be appreciated
440007 the vacuum is empty yet it seems to have properties its absolute permeability and absolute permittivity which have specific finite non zero values why why are the vacuum permeability and permittivity non zero and non infinite what would universe in which the vacuum permeability and permittivity were zero look like what would universe in which the vacuum permeability and permittivity were infinite look like
440211 this is follow up to this great answer all of the other related questions have answers explaining how units come into play when measuring universal constants like the value of the speed of light but what about the fine structure constant its value seems to come out of nowhere and to cite the previously linked question and this is my friend real puzzle in physics solve it to the bottom and you will win yourself nobel prize imagine we have clues about the reason of the value of the fine structure constant what are they
440275 am not physicist just curious mind was reading novel by iain banks where it was mentioned that shifting from artificial rotational gravity in space on rotating space craft to real gravity caused some level of discomfort and this has me thinking is there any truth to that mean am aware that reading science fiction novel does not science make however it also strikes me as an unlikely story line to inject in there if it was not founded on at least some real theory or actual reality so guess it boils down to this from the perspective of the individual experiencing it is there any notable difference from being rotated and thereby experiencing sensation of gravity to person experiencing real gravity from the attraction of mass
440322 encountered question that asks for the reason that perfectly fitting pot and its lid often stick after cooking when it cools down the answer in the solution manual was that the pressure decreases when the temperature decreases understand that point but my problem is the following the pot before being heated during cooking is influenced only by the atmospheric value and the food inside that pot is the atmospheric pressure also so this is the initial state for the pressure inside the pot now when heated the pressure inside the pot increases when we let the pot cool down to the room tempreture would the pressure return to its initial value which is the atmospheric pressure why does the solution manual consider vacuum inside the pot
440399 if person is sitting on chair his momentum is zero and his uncertainty in position should be infinite but we can obviously position him at most within few chair lengths what am missing do we have to invoke earths motion motion of the galaxy etc to resolve the issue
440510 when driving my car over bump or quick change in gradient from flat to uphill or downhill to flat if dont drive slowly and the bump change in gradient is large enough ill end up with my front bumper dragging on the road bump but if go slowly theres no such issue would expect that the wheels are still taking the same path regardless of the speed so the cars body should also act the same regardless why does it make difference when speed is changed why doesnt the car behave the same way regardless
441019 when abruptly braking with the rear wheel on bike it tends to skid pretty easily doing the same with the front wheel is very different experience instead of skidding the bike lifts the rear wheel ive never seen the front wheel of bike skid according to this answer the torque generated on bike during breaking is set around the front wheel contact point while this explains why the rear wheel is lifted it doesnt really explain why the wheel almost never slips what causes the front wheel to behave like it had more friction grip with the ground
441115 in flat space where special relativity works travelling body can only return to the same point if we apply some kind of acceleration to the body so twin paradox is not paradox because travelling body that returns to the same point where it starts is not an inertial reference but then we have general relativity that states that mass energy curves space time so when photon changes its trajectory passing nearby sun its actually moving in straight line but in curved space time now we can create new version of twin paradox where the spaceship that carries one of the twins uses the curvature of some astronomical body like jupiter sun or black hole to return to the same point in that case which twin will be older how to solve the paradox in this context
441144 would like to ask if anyone has found tight enough way to define the term quantum fluctuation so that it can become useful rather than misleading piece of physics terminology terminology in science serves guess two main purposes as an aide to understanding as we learn to enable us to communicate fluently with one another it is the first that concerns me here let me first deal with the second issue to get it out of the way if one expert in quantum theory uses the phrase quantum fluctuation in the course of conversation with another expert then they probably both have in mind something about the non zero value of kinetic energy in the ground state of motion or the non zero range of values of some observable or the mathematics of quantum field theory or something like that they may be interested in symmetry breaking or phase transitions the terminology quantum fluctuation doesnt matter since they both know what they are talking about in much more precise mathematical terms they wont be misled by the phrase any more than someone working in qcd would be misled by terminology such as charm and colour now lets return to the first issue which is the heart of my question is this phrase well chosen does it help people to get good understanding or does it tend to mislead does it give good physical intuition does it mean something other than quantum spread can we find sufficiently tight definition of quantum fluctuation so that it becomes more helpful than it is misleading the following web article illustrates the use of quantum fluctuation as an attempt to describe quantum field theory for the non expert https profmattstrassler com articles and posts particle physics basics quantum fluctuations and their energy language such as jitter is freely employed such attempts show that the term invites the student to form physical picture of something dynamically moving around countless books and lectures talk freely about bubbling and rippling etc etc here are my reservations in so called zero point motion there is no motion there is kinetic energy admittedly and langle psi hat psi rangle ne but in my minds eye dont see the oscillator fluctuating so much as just sitting there not moving too and fro but simply spread out it is not like classical standing wave where the oscillating string or whatever moves up and down and it is not like thing moving to and fro in potential well the electron in the ground state of hydrogen is not fluctuating in ordinary english the word fluctuation refers to something dynamic involving change as function of time but in the case of time independent hamiltonian there is no dynamic change for system in an energy eigenstate except for the unobservable global phase this assertion applies as much to field states in quantum field theory as it does to non relativistic quantum mechanics so where are these famous vacuum fluctuations note again my question does not concern correct mathematical treatment of field theory it concerns whether the term fluctuation is well chosen to give good physical understanding the virtual particles that appear in feynman diagrams are not fluctuations they are terms in series of integrals whose sum describes smooth and non fluctuating scattering process classical phase transitions may be said to be driven by thermal fluctuations thats fine it is an example of dynamic change cause and effect but if someone says that quantum phase transition is driven or caused by quantum fluctuation and think people do say that then what exactly are they saying spontaneous emission by atoms manifests the coupling between the atom and the electromagnetic field in its vacuum state and demonstrates that the field is not absent nor without physical effect since there is stochastic nature to the clicks if the emitted photons are detected by ordinary detectors one might loosely ascribe the randomness in the timing of the detection events to randomness in the behaviour of the field in its vacuum state is this perhaps what quantum fluctuation means do want an answer if there is one dont intend merely to generate discussion but think my question may be hard to answer because it touches on unresolved interpretational issues to do with the quantum measurement problem and on the physics of symmetry breaking related questions this question quantum fluctuations of the vacuum gives link to video showing computer simulation of vacuum fluctuations in lecture by david tong what exactly is being plotted in the simulation here this question understanding quantum fluctuations is similar to mine but different enough to warrant my new one found this question and its discussion helpful what is spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum systems
441648 just like this guys the color of my stoves flames were affected by the humidifier as well why does this happen is it good thing or bad thing
442461 understand that atoms emit photons of wavelength lambda when electrons transition to lower orbitals according to the equation frac hc lambda based on my understanding those orbitals have fixed energies and simple elements like oxygen should have small number of orbitals the number of transitions possible and thus the number of wavelengths should be quite small how then is the large numbers of lines on the oxygen line spectrum explained
442583 in the quantum mechanics courses in ocw mit edu it is said that any wave function can be expanded as superposition of the eigenfunctions of any observable the eigenfunctions form eigenbasis for our space however if we take an arbitrary basis for our space is that space an eigenbasis corresponding to an observable in other words is any basis set of eigenfunctions of some observable
442719 ive been wondering why does this really happen mean by intuition if electrons are driven by emf ignoring wires resistance coulombs would pass by point per second until they encounter something that slows them down thus the rate of flow would change why does current remain the same one answer saw somewhere that made sense to me is that it indeed slows electrons down but electrons lose some of their energy to compensate the loss of velocity in way that would bring the current back to the constant current and this lose of energy is called drop in voltage and thats why voltage decreases when running over some resistance is this true
442764 when water is poured out in space why does it always take spherical ball like shape
443260 in the lord of the rings it is claimed that no man has the strength to pierce the skin of the giant spider shelob in dramatic turn of events shelob lunges at sam with such force that she pierces herself with sams sword this seems physically impossible to me assuming the real world laws of physics are in effect wouldnt sam need the strength to hold the sword in place in order to actually pierce and by newtons third law and the above claim require impossible strength maybe this has something to do with impulse which never fully understood
443358 in depictions of the double slit experiment that model the photon or electron as particle when attempting to measure which slit the particle passes through it always shows the particle entering one of the two slits why is it that the particle cant hit the space between or outside the slits never even make it through is it implied that the experiment is just repeated until particle makes it through shows up on the film or detector on the other side see how modeled as wave the wave always makes it through but the illustrations of particles kind of dont make sense to me is it because they are just simplified illustrations realize this sounds like silly question but im trying to go back and question everything ive taken for granted for example wondered what if there is some weird hidden interaction between the ones that didnt make it through and the ones that did
443607 in quantum field theory with the field phi and the momentum pi being operators their time evolution is governed in the heisenberg picture by the heisenberg equation begin align dot phi frac hbar hat phi dot pi frac hbar hat pi end align now in case the hamiltonian operator hat int 3x hat cal can be written as an integral over the hamiltonian density hat cal and the fields and the momenta commute at non equal positions do the same equations hold as well with the hamiltonian operator being replaced by its density what would the caveats be begin align dot phi frac hbar hat cal phi dot pi frac hbar hat cal pi end align
443892 in youngs double slit experiment can we get an even number of maxima in the central envelope maximum if so how and why the regular modelling of the double split interfaces is with an odd number like in the picture source of the pic hyperphysics
443988 ive been trying to find the error in this approach to calculate the work of uniform gravitational field on an object falling to the ground in the direction begin align int vec cdot mathrm vec mg int hat cdot mathrm vec end align because object is moving down mathrm vec mathrm vec begin align mg int hat cdot mathrm vec mg int hat cdot mathrm vec end align because hat is parallel to mathrm vec then the vector dot product is mathrm begin align mg int mathrm mg end align which is less than zero when and thus obviously wrong yet simplistic approach has fd with the two vectors parallel and it is clear that the work is really positive can someone point out which axiom of math or physics my math conflicts with my instinct is that once the scalar mathrm is obtained the integral transforms to new coordinate system where the motion is understood to be in the positive direction rather than the negative as the integral is set up is this common mistake is the lesson that when performing dot product within an integral the sign of the integral has to checked analytically or is there simpler axiom im missing could easily envision myself if was writing code to try to follow the algebra without thinking too analytically and thus getting wrong answer ive studied undergrad linear algebra vector calculus and intermediate mechanics but dont recall ever seeing this issue arise
444005 am trying to understand electric circuits ie voltage current power and resistance for the most part everything makes perfect sense but for some reason do not feel as if understand the proper definition of power yes understand the formulas ir and iv but am strong believer that you do not truly understand something until you can explain it to someone else in laymans terms which cannot confidently do at this point in time perhaps can explain my confusion using the water analogy which im not particularly fond of but will use anyone for illustrative purposes understand that if water is flowing through hose or pipe the amount of water at specific spot per second is analogous to electrical current the pressure to voltage and the width of the pipe to resistance now lets imagine two hoses one has twice the resistance meaning it has smaller physical width than the other but we also make sure that both hoses have the same current meaning that the smaller hose has twice the voltage water pressure if we were to hit some toy windmills with the water coming out of each of these hoses from the same distance of course it is my understanding that they would start spinning at the same speed or another way to put this might be that the work done upon them is the same now this is where my confusion starts because in this situation the current is the same for both hoses but the power watts is doubled for the hose that requires double the voltage to maintain the same current due to it having twice the resistance when think of the word power and something that has twice as much of it as something else my mind instantly thinks it is twice as powerful and thus can exert more force or do more work on external objects but here it seems like current is what determines the speed at which the windmills would turn or how bright light bulb in closed electrical circuit would be in fact it seems like power in this context is requirement or the the amount of effort required to keep the current at constant rate given certain voltage this also makes me think that the the hose with twice the power is less efficient obviously due to the resistance but thinking of power like this seems counter intuitive and perhaps am not understanding something important here is power truly the effort required by the circuit to run or is it about potential work that circuit can exert on external things any clarification is greatly appreciated
444139 after reading lot and trying to understand people explain it made an image in my mind that fundamental particles are given position in space to which is given properties these properties being the spin mass energy etc and not forgetting that even space itself is formed by particles is that description correct or at least have come close to understanding it if its not right could you please help me see how it works of course if it is possible to explain
444307 rock sitting on land the ocean floor or floating in space maintains its shape somehow gravity isnt keeping it together because it is too small so im assuming it is chemical or nuclear bonds keeping it together as solid if not it would simply crumble apart so what type of energy maintains the shape of rock where did this energy come from and is it slowly dissipating as corollary if large rock is placed on top of small rock is the energy required to maintain the shape of the small rock used at greater rate
444328 in my physics class have this problem that shows two lightbulbs one 60w and one 100w in series connected to 120v battery the problems are which bulb is brighter 60w calculate the power dissipated by the 60w bulb 4w calculate the power dissipated by the 100w bulb 1w why is the power dissipated not simply the wattages of the bulbs followed one workthrough online where you first find for both using and then use to get current of 3125a the power dissipated is then calculated using 2r and you get the above answers however doesnt that assume the voltage drop between the lightbulbs is 120v in both cases and isnt that wrong tried getting it another way where said p1 iv1 p2 iv2 and v1 v2 120volts solved the voltage drop on the 60w lightbulb to be 45v and 75v on the 100w one then current is solved to be 3a which lets us solve the resistance for each one as 75ohms and 25ohms then using the formula the original wattages are found as the answer why is it right to assume 120v for both bulbs
444387 in music when two or more pitches are played together at the same time they form chord if each pitch has corresponding wave frequency pure or fundamental tone the pitches played together make superposition waveform which is obtained by simple addition this wave is no longer pure sinusoidal wave for example when you play low note and high note on piano the resulting sound has wave that is the mathematical sum of the waves of each note the same is true for light when you shine 500nm wavelength green light and 700nm wavelength red light at the same spot on white surface the reflection will be superposition waveform that is the sum of green and red my question is about our perception of these combinations when we hear chord on piano we re able to discern the pitches that comprise that chord we re able to pick out that there are two or three etc notes in the chord and some of us who are musically inclined are even able to sing back each note and even name it it could be said that we re able to decompose fourier series of sound but it seems we cannot do this with light when you shine green and red light together the reflection appears to be yellow pure hue of 600nm rather than an overlay of red and green we can pick out the individual colors that were combined why is this why can we see two hues of light in the same way we re able to hear two pitches of sound is this characteristic of human psychology animal physiology or is this due to fundamental characteristic of electromagnetism

444672 for distant observer physical black hole takes an infinite amount of time collapse because time is redshifted near the schwarzchild radius instead of the matter crossing the horizon it will just pancake closer and closer to the without ever forming horizon on the other hand hawkings derivation relies on the existence of bona fide horizon can the horizon radiate before it even exists
444902 given that acceleration induces measurable physical effects would it be correct to say that there should be an absolute inertial frame of reference know that one cannot distinguish priori between acceleration and gravitational effects but there should be determined distribution of mass in the universe and assuming it is known its effects should be able to be subtracted to deduce absolute acceleration is this incorrect

445745 ive scoured the internet for clear answer on entropy and see contradictory answers everywhere so im going to refine my question here please read carefully as the question is not as it seems at first the formation of spherical planets from dust clouds in the universe seems to be an example of particles coming from random more distributed state to more spherical state this seems to look like entropy decreasing there are more microstates for total dust particle positions and velocities spread out over the volume of gas cloud then there are possible dust particle positions and velocities of particles confined to spherical planetary shape thus if the formation of planets from dust clouds involve particles moving from higher amount of microstates to lower amount of microstates then entropy is seemingly decreasing the common response to this statement is that it is wrong when particles clump under gravity heat radiation is generated and spread out to the universe increasing the overall entropy of the universe while decreasing local entropy now watch this video https vimeo com in this computerized simulation heat radiation is removed from the equation also there is no concept of local entropy vs overall entropy as you are observing the entire simulated universe in the video thats right you are looking at the entire simulated universe and observing all the entropy within it not localized part no heat or radiation or anything else the only rules here are newtonian mechanics thats it yet in this video we see the amount of microstates spontaneously decrease we see particles organize themselves into spheres why what is wrong with my understanding of entropy can someone explain whats happening to entropy in this video from statistical mechanics point of view understand this simulation may be inaccurate to the universe energy is seemingly be removed the system as the velocities of these particles are artificially lowered during collisions my goal however is to understand this system in terms of microstates and macrostates from statistical mechanics point of view if someone can play devils advocate and explain it from this perspective it will be helpful thank you
446850 for closed system at equilibrium the entropy is maximum is this local maximum or is it global maximum am an undergraduate physics student and it seems that the possibility of entropy having local maximums was not discussed it was always assumed it was global maximum is this true in all cases
446889 in an answer to another question of mine concerning gravity there was link to video about creation of artificial gravity based on rotation the question have might be silly or with an obvious answer but it puzzles me non the less as understand it in order for the centrifugal force which is responsible for creating gravity in this case to work object it works upon should be attached to the wheels spoke or rim if an astronaut walks on the inside of the rim like here in the video the contact with the rim is maintained via legs thus centrifugal force is in action now the question if while being inside rotating space station astronaut would jump really high wouldnt he then experience zero gravity until he again will touch some part wall or floor of the station am missing something in my understanding
446951 hope the question is suitable for this forum watching star trek the next generation have found at least couple cases where navigation malfunction on shuttle makes it fall towards the nearby planet in cuestion of minutes note that the ship is just passing by not getting out of the planet im not an expert physicist but judging by the way we move our probes through the solar system and that even asteroids just pass near earth without blinking understand that you have to spiral around the planet for some time before entering it and crashing on its surface even the tiangong chinese station took long time to fall know the situation is created in the sake of drama but wonder about the possibilities for shuttle to get captured by planets gravity and be forced to crash almost instantly making useless every rescue effort any of you could enlighten me
447287 it is known fact that inertial and gravitational masses are the same thing and therefore are numerically equal this is not an obvious thing since there are even experiments trying to find difference between the two kinds of masses what dont understand is why is this not obvious usually when something that isnt considered obvious seems obvious to me theres something deep that im not getting heres my line of thought the inertial mass is defined by bf bf tag the gravitational mass is derived from the fact that the gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the product of the masses of the objects bf frac g1 g2 bf hat bf tag now if the only force acting on the object is the gravitational force can equate equations and and can always fix the constant in such way that the gravitational mass and the inertial mass are numerically equal whats wrong with this line of thought and why is the equivalence not really so obvious
448573 in this youtube video it is claimed that electrons orbit their atoms nucleus not in well known fixed orbits but within clouds of probability spaces around the nucleus where they can lie with probability of called orbitals it is also claimed that the further away one looks for the electron from the nucleus the more this probability decreases yet it never reaches the authors of the video conclude that there is non zero probability for an atom to have its electron on the other side of the universe if this is true then there must be portion of all atoms on earth whose electron lies outside the milky way which portion of atoms has this property
448673 given battleship suppose we construct tub with exactly the same shape as the hull of the battleship but cm larger we fill the tub with just enough water to equal the volume of space between the hull and the tub now we very carefully lower the battleship into the tub does the battleship float in the tub tried it with two large glass bowls and the inner bowl seemed to float but if the battleship floats doesnt this contradict what we learned in school archimedes principle says any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid surely the battleship weighs far more than the small amount of water that it would displace in the tub note originally specified the tub to be just mm larger in every direction but figured you would probably tell me when layer of fluid becomes so thin buoyancy is overtaken by surface tension cohesion adhesion hydroplaning or whatever wanted this to be question about buoyancy alone
448683 numerical simulations of observed large scale structure formation work best with cold dark matter cdm see the answer here neutrinos are candidates for hot dark matter hdm and hence they cannot account for the total dark matter abundance of the universe by the same token axions are also relativistic because they have very tiny masses arent they also candidates of hdm like neutrinos shouldnt they also be disfavoured for the same reason
448724 many people think of the water analogy to try to explain how electromagnetic energy is delivered to device in circuit using that analogy in dc circuit one could imagine the power consuming device is like water wheel being pushed by the current in the case of an actual water wheel the more water that flows per unit of time the more energy gets delivered to the wheel per unit of time power current but in electric circuits power voltage current why is this
448761 can anyone supply me with derivation of the mean free path of particles in maxwell boltzmann gas cited in various literature is the formula begin align begin split ell frac sqrt sigma end split end align which describes the mean free path of an atom molecule in maxwell boltzmann gas within it is the gas density assumed to be homogeneous and sigma is the cross section of colliding particles derivations of the mean free path tend to include comment about the relative velocity of particles however most literature will not treat this as distribution and will instead follow two part approximate method first magnitude of the relative velocity is expressed using equation within it theta is the angle between relative velocities and begin align tag mathbf sqrt mathbf cdot mathbf sqrt mathbf mathbf cdot mathbf mathbf sqrt mathbf mathbf mathbf cdot mathbf sqrt 2v 1v 2cos theta end align once equation has been found most authors take an average of both sides instead of evaluating this by treating each velocity as distribution however they instead take the average under the square root and onto each summed term equation begin align tag langle rangle big langle sqrt 2v 1v 2cos theta big rangle sqrt big langle 2v 1v 2cos theta big rangle sqrt big langle big rangle big langle big rangle big langle2v 1v 2cos theta big rangle sqrt langle rangle langle rangle sqrt langle rangle langle rangle sqrt langle rangle sqrt langle rangle end align large amount of is wrong exceptions are the forth and fifth steps where an average of the dot product between two arbitrary velocities is zero justified by the velocity in maxwell boltzmann distribution having no preferred direction the remaining step involves the average velocity of any particle in boltzmann gas being the same langle rangle langle rangle one might think to replace the average of the square of velocity with an rms velocity however doing so yields the rms relative velocity distribution which is out by from the mean relative velocity would like to see derivation of the same result without these approximate methods failing that reference to textbook that provides them would be helpful as well references all use the approximation reif fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics mcgraw hill new york formula for mean free path in two dimensions why is the mean free path divided by sqrt rms free path vs mean free path
448763 the schwarzchild geometry is defined as ds left1 frac 2gm rightdt left1 frac 2gm right dr 2d theta sin theta phi lets examine what happens close to and far away from black hole for stationary observer at infty we get tau ds left1 frac 2gm infty rightdt dt so the time measured is the proper time for an observer orbiting black hole assume circular where theta pi distance away from the black hole we get tau left1 frac 2gm rightdt 2d phi for circular orbit it can be shown that phi frac gm dt and hence tau left1 frac 3gm rightdt thus tau the time measured by an observer infinitely far away from black hole is less than dt the time measured by an observer orbiting black hole which appears to suggest that time moves faster close to black holes would someone be able to point out the flaw in my logic here
449169 one possible lagrangian for point particle moving in possibly curved spacetime is sqrt mu nu dot mu dot nu where dot is derivative with respect to parameter lambda this lagrangian gives an action proportional to proper time and it is reparametrization invariant lambda need not be an affine parameter if we try to go to the hamiltonian picture we have the momenta mu frac sqrt dot mu nu dot nu which obey the relation we then get that the hamiltonian mu dot mu is identically zero understand that this is not problem because since we have constraint phixp according to the dirac method we should really use the hamiltonian phi as explained for example in this post but what would like to know is why do we get zero hamiltonian suspect that this is due to the reparametrization invariance and the fact that we dont have preferred notion of time will this always happen why
449201 ive seen this question asked before but cant find an answer to the specific point im troubled with from the kinetic theory of gases pressure results from molecules colliding with the walls of container enclosing gas imparting force upon the wall now if we split the container into two halves am told that pressure remains the same on either side of the partition assuming the gas has uniform density throughout the container but if we split the container into two isnt there effectively half the number of molecules striking the wall on each side so the pressure should also be halved shouldnt pressure be dependent on the number of molecules
449219 recently learned the law of universal gravitation gmm it dictates that all objects should fall at the same acceleration but how is density explained then take for example watercontainer with ball inside denser than water however the mass of the water is the same as the mass of the ball so if gravity pulls the water and the ball with the same force how come the ball sink
449333 am studying basic quantum theory my question is why cant particle penetrate an infinite potential barrier the reasoning that have applied is that particles under consideration have finite energy so to cross an infinite potential barrier the particle requires infinite energy but cannot think of the mathematical relation between potential and energy so that indeed am convinced that to cross an infinite potential barrier the particle needs infinite energy what is the relation between the potential and energy of quantum mechanical particles
449431 there is no acceptable viable mechanism for free electron to absorb or emit energy without violating energy or momentum conservation so its wavefunction cannot collapse into becoming particle right how do free electrons repel each other then
449543 consider the vector operator for angular momentum hat hat vec hat vec hat vec does this mean that if we want to measure the angular momentum of particle in state psi we take hat and let it act on psi to give us three possible eigenvalues of hat hat and hat which will correspond to the xyz components of the angular momentum but since hat hat and hat does not commute this should not be the meaning of hat because if we first make measurement of hat the state of the particle will be changed and hat should no longer act on the original state psi what then does the vector operator hat gives us more precisely what is the measurement this operator hat is trying to measure
449658 studying electromagnetism came across the following fact maxwells third equation divergence of magnetic field is zero can be derived from the biot savart law the biot savart law can be derived from maxwell amp res law hence it seems that the four equations are redundant unfortunately ive not found anything about this so ask it is true edit for the sake of completeness this is the proof of the 3rd equation this is basically griffiths proof begin eqnarray vec iiint frac mu pi frac vec times vec tau iiint frac mu pi vec times nabla left frac right tau end eqnarray applying divergence to both terms we obtain begin eqnarray text div vec frac mu pi iiint text div left vec times nabla left frac right right tau frac mu pi iiint nabla times vec cdot nabla left frac right vec cdot nabla times nabla left frac right tau end eqnarray the last term is zero since the curl of gradient is always zero and the divergence of vec is zero vec depends on primed coordinates only and this is the derivation of the biot savart law from the maxwell amp re law is biot savart law obtained empirically or can it be derived
449771 when boiling water ive noticed that bubbles will appear to grow at the bottom of the glass for period of time and then rise ive read that bubbles form from nucleation centers but dont know the specifics of the nucleation dynamics is there possible scenario where the bubbles while still appearing to adhere to the bottom of the glass are in an equilibrium where the bottom par of the bubble is being formed by water evaporating into gas but at the top of the bubble which might be slightly cooler the gas is redissolving into liquid phase if the two rates are the same then the bubble would appear stationary at some point the water heats up enough to have rate of evaporation greater than dissolving throughout the entire bulk of the liquid and the bubble will survive its transit to the top of the liquid think that falling drops experience dynamic that is th opposite of this couple other thoughts that ive considered know that boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of water is greater than atmospheric pressure believe that this condition is achieved even when the bubble is stationary since the bubble is displacing the surrounding bulk water and air think that carbonated beverages can have bubbles stick to the side of glass but suspect that the reason for this is different but dont have an intuition about why carbon dioxide bubbles in cold drink might stick since the beverage is cold
450054 title is self explanatory im assuming both water and air are transparent so if they are true how can clearly distinguish an air bubble under water
450139 we know the the vector form of maxwell equations begin align vec nabla cdot vec pi rho label diff vec nabla times vec dfrac pi vec dfrac dfrac partial vec partial label diff iv vec nabla times vec dfrac dfrac partial vec partial label diff iii vec nabla cdot vec label diff ii end align the last two of them allow us to introduce the potentials begin align vec frac1c frac partial vec partial vec nabla phi vec vec nabla times vec end align which tells us about gauge invariance of equations all four of maxwells equations can be written compactly as begin align partial mu mu nu frac pi nu tag partial mu alpha beta tag end align and according to the last one equation the first one we can rewrite use preferred gauge in form begin equation box mu frac pi mu end equation now we consider the einstein gr equations begin equation mu nu pi mu nu frac12g mu nu end equation or in gamma field form indexes are omitted begin equation partial gamma partial gamma gamma gamma gamma gamma pi mu nu frac12g mu nu end equation we know in weak field limit the equations get simply form externally similar to maxwell ones so called gravitomagnetism in vector form or in covariant form begin equation box mu nu pi mu nu frac12 eta mu nu end equation thus the question why for covariant form of maxwell equations we need two different entities of equations but for the gr the only one or another words can we write the einstein gr equations for weak field limit similar to maxwell equations in field form not via potentials
450187 in hamiltonian mechanics we search change of coordinates that leaves the hamilton equation invariant these are the canonical transformations my question is why we want to leave the equations invariant mean we want to solve differential equation the hamilton equation so why restrict ourselves only to certain kind of change of coordinates why we care about the form suppose that sometimes could exist some non canonical transformation that makes me solve the equation or not
450208 would like to start by saying that am not physicist and dont really know lot about the subject we all know that without earths magnetic field electromagnetic radiation from the sun would cook us within minutes it is only the magnetic field that protects us from them since visible light is the same thing as cosmic rays except that its different wavelength was wondering if it were possible to use magnetic fields they would have to be pretty strong to essentially block light the same way it blocks cosmic rays

450899 was recently having twitter conversation with uc riverside prof john carlos baez about geometric quantization and he said about his work that right for example you can get the quantum spin particle by quantizing the classical spin particle something your mother probably didnt tell you about then asked him to clarify and his response was was talking about plain old nonrelativistic spin particle whose hilbert space is mathbb the spin representation of su2 now this confused me in his second quote he seems to be talking about precisely what understood to be quantum spin particle this led to the following question question what exactly is classical spin particle and how does it differ from quantum spin particle my guess is that classical spin particle system with classical spinors in the fundamental of su2 psi chi is described by the state psi chi otimes psi where otimes is just the usual direct product such state in general is not anti symmetric under the exchange psi leftrightarrow chi which if we imposed anti commutation relations between chi and psi would then become quantum spin particles counterexamples to my guess example when writing down the generating functional for qed theory we have that int psi bar psi int 4x bar psi not partial psi ie bar psi gamma mu mu psi where psi are referred to as classical dirac spinors however these are always defined to be grassman valued and so satisfy the proper anti commutation relations which leads me to believe that my guess cannot be correct on some level as it essentially puts all the quantum in the anti commuting nature of the spinors example my understanding is that it was group theoretical fact that otimes oplus see no reason why this should not hold for two classical spinors of su2 but then it seems that we are able to derive the addition of angular momentum what thought was quantum result from classical spinors edit as knzhou pointed out in the comments baez may have been just referring to single spin particle so will also pose the question what is the difference between spinor psi that describes classical spin particle and spinor psi which describes quantum spin particle edit per request in the comments have posted the link to the conversation here update baez has since written an article further fleshing out notion of classical spin particles
451045 how can the density of region of space go from finite density to infinite when there are no numbers larger than any aleph0 number but smaller than any aleph1 number no decimal point in front of it of course arent planck volumes and strings designed to sidestep infinities my point there stated differently is how can the density go from finite to infinite when there is no number gap between finite and infinite with cantor losing his mind contemplating that gap and did he not prove that none was constructible possible the entropy of the visible universe is if im not too far off the mark this is stupendous number but no closer to infinity than any other integer or real and there is no room in it to tuck singularity away in simpler terms our bh has finite mass if it has region of infinite density that region must be infinitesimal but the planck length is the lower limit on the size of regions of space there are therefore no points in space no infinitesimals only punctoids my term of convenience the utility of which may become obvious in future posts and no infinities
451267 if have two asteroids one dead still in space and one whizzing by at 10000mph what is the difference between the two physically if freeze time and look at the two of them what differences would they have how could one tell that one was moving really quickly and the other not is there some sort of quantum difference with the particles in front or behind the asteroid does it have different gravitational force on spacetime surrounding it no images online seem to suggest this as earth moves quickly through space but has simple aligned bump beneath im just programmer who is interested in physics has been watching too many leonard susskind lectures recently
451588 it is usual in physics that when we have variable that is very small or very large we do power series expansion of the function of that variable and eliminate the high order terms but my question is why do we usually make the expansion and then approximate why dont we just do the limit in that function when that value is very small tends to zero or is very large tends to infinity
451751 in an electromagnetic wave could the magnetic field be mirrored around the xy plane is there specific reason that the fields are oriented this way is it just convention
451979 ever since special relativity weve had this equation that puts time and space on an equal footing ds dt dx dy dz but theyre obviously not equivalent because theres sign difference between space and time question how does relative sign difference lead to situation where time only flows forward and never backward we can move back and forth in space so why does the negative sign mean we cant move back and forth in time it sounds like something should know yet dont the only thing can see is dt could be positive or negative corresponding to forwards and backwards in time but after being squared that sign difference disappears so nothing changes related questions what grounds the difference between space and time what is time does it flow and if so what defines its direction however im phrasing this question from relativity viewpoint not thermodynamics
452308 the canonical maxwells equations are derivable from the lagrangian cal frac mu nu mu nu by solving the euler lagrange equations however the lagrangian above is invariant under the gauge transformation mu to mu partial mu lambdax for some scalar fiend lambdax that vanishes at infinity this implies that there will be redundant degrees of freedom in our equations of motion maxwells equations therefore as understand gauge fixing this implies that maxwells equations without gauge fixing can lead to unphysical predictions question hence my question is simply are maxwells equations the ones derived from cal above actually physical in the sense they do not make unphysical predictions example the general solution to the equations of motion derived from cal is given by mux sum int frac 3p pi frac sqrt 2e mathbf left epsilon mu mathbf mathbf ipx epsilon mu mathbf mathbf dagger ipx right where we have at first polarization states for external photons my understanding is that we can remove one of these degrees of freedom by realizing that is not dynamical but to remove the other one we have to impose gauge invariance cf this seems to imply that unless we fix gauge maxwells equations will predict longitudinal polarization for the photon
452421 im working on the mathematical theory of parabolic equations the prototype of such equations is heat equation given as follows let omega be bounded region of the space and fixed time in omega 0t times omega we consider the following equation alpha delta axu u0x fx where is the initial condition bounded potential alpha is constant and delta is the laplacian im wondering to know the physical meaning of the coefficient and may be alpha and its role in the heat process any reference or suggestion would be helpful
452428 ball falls from magnet but the magnet still exerts an upwards force against gravity yet the ball falls anyway however the ball slows down and thus the sound when it hits the floor is less signalling that some energy has been lost during its descent what im wondering is where that energy has gone has the magnet gained magnet energy or has earth gained energy or has the ball not lost energy but its remaining energy just wasnt turned into sound upon contact with the ground or is it something else
452452 in recent tweet dr michio kaku stated that perfect blackness would violate the heisenberg uncertainty principle every object must emit some radiation have two questions regarding this statement could someone please elaborate on how exactly perfect blackness violates the uncertainty principle am somewhat familiar with this principle so detailed answer would be appreciated apparently dark matter doesnt emit any radiation how isnt this direct contradiction to kakus statement and violation of the uncertainty principle
452592 light waves are type of electromagnetic wave and they fall between nm long microwaves are less energetic but seem to be more dangerous than visible light is visible light dangerous at all and why not
452726 im doing some physics homework calculating the total resistance between points and and while some circuits are comprehensible there are two that cant understand how they work at all so it is my pleasure to present to you these two monstrosities how do approach the crossing resistances in each one heres where am as of writing this post the divided square the two 10k resistances are parallel to each other the 20k and 9k resistances are parallel to each other dont know what to do with the 5k one the hellborn triangles of death the first and last pair of 5k resistances are parallel to each other the bottom center 5k resistance is in series with the previous two couples dont know what to do with the 15k ones so long story short how should handle these situations when the resistances are connected by both sides and the circuit looks like the voltage should converge inside them and start burning

453980 hi everyone and sorry for my english would like to know if can build legitimate vector as alpha mathbf id like you to check if my way is correct we already know that mathbf transforms under lorentz boost as begin equation label sdf begin aligned mathbf gamma left mathbf vec beta times mathbf right dfrac gamma gamma vec beta left vec beta cdot mathbf right 5mm text so 5mm parallel parallel mathbf perp gamma left mathbf perp vec beta times mathbf right end aligned end equation while the spatial component of any vector must obey the following rule begin equation begin aligned parallel gammae parallel beta mathbf perp mathbf perp end aligned end equation so both expressions must to be equal begin equation left begin aligned gamma parallel gamma beta parallel gamma mathbf perp gamma vec beta times mathbf mathbf perp end aligned right end equation from the first one we can conclude that time component of vector must be dfrac gamma gamma beta parallel or dfrac gamma gamma beta vec beta cdot mathbf but what can we conclude for the second one is therefore possible to build that vector alpha thank you very much
454068 speaking of what understood spacetime is three dimensions of space and one of time now if we look at general relativity spacetime is generally reckoned as fabric so my question is whether spacetime is real or is just mathematical construct to understand various things in addition to this if its mathematical thing then what does its distortion bending mean
454103 know this may sound like strange question but have always wondered what exactly the mathematical point of momentum is have understood energy to be an attempt to reformulate newtons 2nd law to be time independent and to study system without having to consider time however struggle to find goal for momentum forgive me if this question is little strange
454158 lets say we have an harmonic oscillator at temperature in superposition of state and psi frac phi phi sqrt where each phi has energy the probability of finding each the state would be in this case however approaching this problem with statistical mechanics the probability would be proportional to bt what is wrong with my approach
454292 the higgs boson is an excitation of the higgs field and is very massive and short lived it also interacts with the higgs field and thus is able to experience mass why does it decay if it is supposed to be an elementary particle according to the standard model
454332 according to newtons third law of motion that states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction so if the earth exerts gravitational pull on us people then even we should exert force equal and opposite in terms of direction on the earth it is intuitive to think that this force is really small to get the earth to move but if we take look at the second law of motion that states that ma we see that however small the force there will be some amount of acceleration therefore even though we exert very small gravitational force on the earth it should be enough to get the earth to move even though the acceleration is very small amount but what said clearly does not happen so there must be some flaw with my reasoning what is that flaw

455526 know that supernova can mess up the heliosphere of nearby stars but im wondering if it could physically push neighboring stars off their trajectories its fun to imagine all the stars surrounding supernova being propelled outward and tumbling out of the galactic arm would expect that really close star such as partner in binary pair would get really messed up im thinking more about the neighbors few light years away realize that supernova involves both the initial em burst and the mass ejection which arrives later im open to the effects of any of these things
456150 am not sure how to ask this question but am learning about potential energy in my high school physics class from the definition of potential energy energy stored in an object with the potential to convert into other type of energy dont understand how an object lets say ball on the ground which has zero kinetic energy and zero potential energy can fall off cliff and gain kinetic energy when it had no potential energy how can it now be gaining energy also another question that was already discussed in se but didnt find my answer there is why do we talk about the potential energy of system ball earth but kinetic energy of an object ball thanks
456455 know there is dimensional objects due to communicating with my friend group never found how would you find the volume because it was off the science channel
456512 here is an interesting question for those who are familiar with vacuum science techniques in the attached picture we have damaged surface of kf flange which comes from the turbo pump outlet and connects to roughing pump we believe this is source of major leak our roughing pump or helium leak checker can pump out small way cross efficiently but the same way cross attached to the turbo pump inlet sealed cannot be pumped down efficiently how would one fix scratched flange surface like this tried putting some silicone vacuum grease but didnt fix the problem update we tried the ptfe ring as suggested below but it did not prevent the leak my suspicion is that because the damage is on the inner diameter of the flange the ring cannot simply fill in the gap resulting in the inner diameter only the centering ring not the ring touches there think update the turbopump was repaired by duniway stockroom what they tell me is that the scratches were not to blame for the leak what matters for the foreline flange is the presence of deep scratches that may connect to the outside and in our case no scratches were of this kind the deep scratches that we had were closer toward the inner diameter the actual culprit for the leak was that there was crack in the joint between the foreline flange and the main body of the pump
456619 my physics teacher told us that we can divide vectors that vector division has no physical meaning or significance how about this vdv dx it says acceleration vector equals velocity as function of times dv divided by dx here both dv and dx are vectors how do make sense of it because vector division doesn exist in physics right
456686 ive obviously seen that mc but ive also seen that the equation mc pc where momentum is true if you square mc and subtract the result from the other equation you get pc in other words momentum doesnt exist assume combining these equations is mistake is mc only something that holds in certain circumstances is mc pc the more complete correct version of mc know im wrong where exactly is my mistake
456771 have just been introduced to the notion of virtual displacement and am quite confused my professor simply defined virtual displacement as an infinitesimal displacement that occurs instantaneously in the configuration space but this doesnt make any mathematical sense to me is there way of defining the notion of virtual displacement and by extension virtual work and generalized forces in way that is more mathematically rigorous assuming purely geometric holonomic constraints as well as purely conservative forces in the definition is acceptable as side note have seen some sources give vague statements that the virtual displacements are elements of the tangent space of the manifold of constraint and other sources suggest that the virtual displacements are result of the total derivative of the position of particle rigorous definition of virtual displacement should make the connection between these two concepts more clear
456808 ive done bit of research and have learned that computers solve the three body problem by using numerical methods for ordinary differential equations but cant really find anything about it other then wikipedia does anyone have any good sources about this topic that isnt any kind of wikipedia my thoughts currently im using simulations of three bodies flying around each other using newtons gravitational law and at random time in the simulation everything goes chaotic though that this was the only way to kind of solve it but how does this numerical methods for ordinary differential equations method work and what does the computer actually do
457359 in finding the solutions to the wave equation for spherically symmetric potential vr we look for the eigenfunctions of hat and hat operators however what is the reasoning behind this the time independent schrodinger equation hat psi psi this is an eigenvalue equation and any eigenfunction of hat this equation is obviously solution for this equation now when there is spherically symmetric potential vr understand that because of separation of variables we can look for solutions of the form psi vec theta phi vec theta phi now to find the angular part why do we look for eigenstates of hat and hat operators know that they commute
457410 if bang bottle filled with supercooled water against hard surface the ice crystals form from the top to the bottom hspace 50px hspace 75px source youtube has videos showing this effect question why dont the ice crystals begin from the bottom when the force is applied to the bottom
457686 only have high school physics knowledge but here is my understanding fusion atoms come together to form new atom this process releases the energy keeping them apart and is very energetic like the sun fission something fast like an electron smashes into an atom breaking it apart somehow this also releases energy less energy than fusion and its like nuclear reactor now my understanding is that the lowest energy state is when everything is tightly stuck together as per fusion and it costs energy to break them apart so why do both fusion and fission release energy
457834 string theory is arguably among best candidates for theory of everything so because every toe is an attempt to bind together the big and very small effects and things toe must be able to describe everything observed am right then how does string theory explain expansion of space and dark energy
457901 if we use yellow light on blue paper what will the paper look like basically have two different conflicting ideas in my head if the light has only one specific wavelength then only this specific wavelength can be reflected at all so if use light of any color on the object the object will always appear in that specific color but on the other hand colored object has that color because it absorbs light of any other wavelength and only reflects the part which gives it the respective color this means that if use any light on an object that has different color the object must appear black probably neither of those are true and its different for example found an interesting image here which shows that red light lets green paprika appear red can one explain what is happening exactly
458136 consider earth moving around the sun is the force of gravity exerted by earth onto the sun directed towards the point where earth is right now or towards the point where earth was minutes ago to account for the speed of light if its the former how does the sun know the current orbital position of earth wouldnt this information have to travel at the speed of light first if its the latter it would force significant slowdown of earths orbital motion because the force of gravity would no longer be directed perpendicular to earths motion but would lag behind obviously this isnt happening so it appears that the force of gravity is indeed directed towards the current orbital position of earth without accounting for the delay caused by the speed of light how is this possible isnt this violation of the principle that no information can travel above the speed of light
458587 according to qm we know that the act of measurement forces particle to acquire definite up to experimental errors position so in particle collider like the one in cern by which means do we force particles to acquire definite position so that they collide my guts says the answer first point out that we are not actually colliding anything but rather we are forcing the probability distribution of two particles say protons to overlap and at the end they somehow acquire position hence collide but this is just an educated guess
458631 uranium has half life of about million years and critical mass of about kg that means if you take large number of atoms say kg amount and put each atom in separate sealed container then after million years about half of the atoms will have decayed now suppose instead we have just kg lump of the stuff in this case the atoms are allowed interact with each other and by definition of fissile material they do very strongly whenever one atom decays it shoots off particles with hit the other atoms and make them more likely to decay if we had critical mass this effect would compound itself and wed get nuclear explosion there would be sudden explosive decay that would continue until we get below critical mass since we only have half critical mass the decay rate will not be so fast or sudden but wed still expect the interaction make half the atoms decay in less than million years how does one compute this half life edit time for half the atoms to decay feel free to make whatever assumptions about the lump of material as desired for example an idealized shape density or some external force pushing the atoms together to prevent the lump blowing itself apart
458828 recently answered question on the worldbuilding forum about grenades and bullets one of the things that came up was that argued smokeless powder in rifle round could detonate but was challenged on that commenters said that smokeless powder only deflagrates during normal use this however leaves me with question how can we accelerate bullet to supersonic speeds using only sonic speed pressure wave as the bullet approaches the speed of sound shouldnt the pressure wave be pushing the bullet less effectively it strikes me that bullet traveling at the speed of sound should not be able to be pushed by pressure wave at the speed of sound how does this work
459142 have this setup it consists of battery of no internal resistance with voltage and resistor with resistance it also consists of voltmeter of some not so large resistance as good ones should have now my question is will the resistance of the voltmeter matter for this particular circuit think that the voltmeters need to be high resistance only when there are multiple resistances in the circuit and as the internal resistance of the battery always contributes to the total resistance in real cases voltmeter is always expected to be very high resistance please correct me if im wrong have seen other questions related to voltmeters on this site and googled up but couldnt find an answer
459221 was wondering how it is possible for overtones to co exist at the same time when one pulls string it starts to oscillate and forms standing wave with frequency additionally infinite overtones oscillate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequeny with being the nth overtone since all overtones are essentially standing waves too and standing waves are formed due to reflection and interference wouldnt the existence of multiple overtones disturb the wave and not only overtones but any disturbance like interfering waves from the environment wouldnt they hinder the creating of standing waves and lastly from physical standpoint why has the fundamental frequency the greatest amplitude
459323 the question which arose my confusion two resistors with resistance pm omega and pm omega are connected in series in parallel find the equivalent resistance of both combinations the confusion in the end my answer came out to be pm omega and pm omega but according to my book my response for is incorrect it said that the equivalent resistance should have an error of pm not my rounded off answer pm and it book explicitly states that the error in should be expressed as pm to keep in conformity with the rules of significant figures dont understand how this makes any sense especially how it conforms to the rules of significant figures help anyone
459428 have to say right off the bat im little frustrated that there seem to be very contradictory answers about this at least to layman like me if two particles are entangled and you separate them by some huge distance and you measure one of the spins you know the other particle must be spinning the opposite direction the usual analogies hear are things like well if you have blue and red marble you scramble them in bag and then take one blindly and give the other to your friend if you look at your marble and see blue you know your friend must have red to me this sounds like boringly classical pre determination like this whole spooky action at distance is really just the spins were already opposite to begin with and we just separated them as if we had machine that spat out pairs of opposite colored marbles and now were surprised that theyre always opposites regardless of how far apart we are when we see them at the same time people say its not like that either bells inequalities in quantum mechanics the state of something is in this weird superposition where its not known for sure its sort of everything at the same time and it only takes on particular state according to probability distribution so the two particle spins are unknown and yet somehow when you observe one it communicates to the other regardless of distance what its state is so it knows to become to opposite but apparently its not that either and theres no communication actually taking place or information passing from one to the other and this is what really gets my goat the usual response is that we cannot choose what the state is or input any kind of information that can come out the other end feel this answer is bit of cop out because it doesnt address the confusion just sort of attacks low hanging fruit over some semantic difference in the word communication even though what is really being asked is the sort of cause effect relationship going on am fine with the idea that we cant directly input what we want or use it to communicate but how is it not form of the particle is communicating something or causing or influencing something to happen in the other normally this discussion goes nowhere and someone inevitably says well you just have to learn quantum mechanics always find this answer deeply unsatisfying it feels like the other person is giving up on you and cant be bothered to explain it so whats going on im not stupid but im also frustrated that these two interpretations both seem to be wrong and yet no one can actually seem to address the core point of confusion despite googling this question across blogs news articles reddit physics forums quora etc its always the same back and forth theres no communication but its not like the states were known to begin with either how on earth is there third possibility to this
459517 got this question on test and the answer key states that the answer is yes according to what understand electrons are emmitted with different kinetic energies based upon their depth from the metal surface an electron would come out with lesser kinetic energy if it was situated deeper as it would have to go through more collisions this reasoning contradicts the given answer would like to know if my reasoning is correct
459592 for example nucleons in nucleus are in motion with kinetic energies of mev their rest energies are about mev kinetic energy of nucleons is small compared to rest energy they are hence considered non relativistic

459754 dont really understand why wave function collapse is still being taught while we seem to have better interpretations of qm available nowadays during the early development of quantum mechanics the measurement problem was heavily debated topic resulting in general acceptance of the so called copenhagen interpretation the two main problems with it are it is not clear what physically defines an observation there is certain faster than light interaction thought this does not include faster than light travel of information furthermore the idea that the universe is nondeterministic was not appealing to some for example to einstein since we have the many worlds interpretation of qm which resolves both these problems makes qm deterministic again and gives imo much more physical interpretation the original name hugh everett gave to his theory is correlation interpretation which find actually more clear perhaps observer entanglement would be even more natural in the current idiom this theory was first mostly ignored and even now seems to still not get the attention it deserves why are teachers often still teaching wave function collapse with all its shortcomings when they teach qm
459771 this is the part that allows the carnot engine to not violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics but hypothetically why cant we just adiabatically compress the working substance to get it back to state as in the working substance starts at isothermal expansion work is done on the environment adiabatic expansion work is done on the environment temperature is decreasing though so the internal energy of the working substance most now be increased in order for the process to be cycle now use an adiabatic compression to bring the internal energy of the working substance back to that of so that it can repeat the cycle without rejecting heat to cold reservoir know it violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics but is there explanation for as to why this is impossible other than that
459809 if an oxygen atom has six electrons then it has an unfilled orbital and the oxygen atom may share electrons from two hydrogen atoms and form water in order to become more stable but why does oxygen or any other atom for that manner favor stability over instability why cant the oxygen atom just have six electrons and be done with it also is an atom being stable identical to it being neutral
460163 would like to compare the time indicated by two clocks clock is located at the top of mountain the clock is in an helicopter flying stationnary at the same altitude than the clock clock and are at rest with each other and located at the same altitude clock has proper acceleration and clock has non zero proper acceleration is it correct if we neglect the earth rotation tidal effects does the general relativity predicts that both clocks will be equivalent thanks to the clock hypothesis why this simple experiment has never been done instead of sending planes in opposite directions with complex trajectories thank you
460855 lets say we are doing the double slit experiment with electrons we get an interference pattern and if we put detectors at slits then we get two piles pattern because we measure electrons positions when going through slits but an electron interacts with other particles in lot of different ways electric field gravity seems like the whole universe is receiving information about the electrons position why is it not the case and the electron goes through slits unmeasured bonus question in real experiments do we face the problem of not shielding particles from measurement good enough and thus getting mix of both patterns on the screen
461097 both the fundamental constants hbar and have dimensions in particular hbar ml 2t and lt but in natural units we make them dimensionless constants of equal magnitude how is this possible this means length is measured in the same units as time which is measured in the units of inverse mass am measuring the distance between two points in seconds can we do that cannot make myself comfortable with it also why is it not possible to make hbar simultaneously

461488 english is not my native language so please forgive my errors consider this example this is classic an exercise requiring you to calculate the electric field produced by charged ring on its axis here will expose my reasoning to show you what cant understand every small charge dq on the ring is contributing to the electric field its electric field is obviously vector vec frac dq pi epsilon hat we know that because of the symmetry the components of the field behave normally meaning that they add together but the bot components respectively cancel themselves so we only consider the component of the field for our calculations de vec cos theta from what know being de the component of another vector this should be just number however can also see that the simmetry facts make only the direction of the field constant but the de field has still verse depending on the positivity or negativity of the charges of the ring so it cannot be just number my book however does like this it introduces the field as function of numbers de frac lambda dl pi epsilon cos theta it then proceeds to integrate and it considers the final field still as function of but as full fledged vector vec frac lambda cos theta hat pi epsilon int dl now get really confused here first we isolated component de which was not vector however that component still is vector even if its direction is fixed or maybe the book was just considering its magnitude we are now considering the field as function of vector vec that is equal to the product between the original field formula vec and the cos theta because of the simmetry so in the final expression by the book we have the field as vector but also the cos theta which was isolating the component and then also the unit vector of the field is called hat isnt this repetition as you can see am really confused what in this process of calculation keeps being vector and what not if it was to me without getting confused by any book would just return to the step of the first list to the expression de vec cos theta and just proceed to the calculus de frac dq pi epsilon hat cos theta but couldnt say how exactly these vectors interact
461559 as the question above wonder why the relativistic lagrangian is written as mc sqrt frac frac mc gamma know that the kinetic energy of relativistic particle is defined by gamma 1m so why we cant define simply the lagrangian of relativistic particle as its classical analogous gamma 1m if so what is the definition of lagrangian which guide us to the above expression
461833 based on lorentz factor gamma frac sqrt frac it is easy to see since otherwise gamma would be either undefined or complex number which is non physical also as far as understand this equation was known before einsteins postulates were published my question is why didnt lorentz himself conclude that no object can go faster than speed of light or maybe he did do not know feel am missing some contexts here
461971 when you go to the sauna you may sit in room with if it is commercial sauna it will be on for the whole day how does it come that when you sit on the wood you dont get burned believe this question is different than the classical one concerning the feeling of heat which may be explained with low heat transfer after much shorter time other objects seem much hotter and the heat transfer is not different as its still room filled with the same air my guess would be that the reason is the heat capacity but cannot really explain it in my understanding capacity is the ability to store something heat charge why should an object be cooler if it can store less heat also cannot this be ignored in this case as the wood is exposed to the temperature for very long time
462245 the defining property of shm simple harmonic motion is that the force experienced at any value of displacement from the mean position is directly proportional to it and is directed towards the mean position kx from this left frac 2x dt right kx then read from this site let us interpret this equation the second derivative of function of plus the function itself times constant is equal to zero thus the second derivative of our function must have the same form as the function itself what readily comes to mind is the sine and cosine function how can we assume so plainly that it should be sin or cosine only they do satisfy the equation but why are they brought into the picture so directly what want to ask is why can the shm displacement velocity etc be expressed in terms of sin and cosine know the shm is the projection of uniform circular motion proof but an algebraic proof would be appreciated
462533 with simple newtonian laws and in specific context learned that the speed vec of an object is the derivative of the corresponding position vector vec om so that means that vec frac mathrm vec om mathrm so if we only have the speed of an object we need to calculate the primitive of vec to find the corresponding vec om vector but how can write it with math symbols many people use the integral notation without any domain specified just the int symbol and think there isnt any domain specified because its notation but its not exactly the same as primitive right or may be just dont know the correct way for writing primitives heard about the sideset left vec right notation but im not sure about what it means and how to use it
462578 will try to give concise summary of what wrote below understand that it is very long and apologize if am wasting your time used the li nard wiechert potential and the lorentz force formula to derive equations of motion for charged particles that do not involve the mathbf and mathbf fields use this in two body problem setup with two charges and want to see whether the resulting equations result in spiraling orbits more specifically plug in the formulas for mathbf and mathbf given by li nard wiechert into the lorentz force formula mathbf mathbf 1t mathbf mathbf 1t mathbf dot 1t times mathbf mathbf 1t and use the classical equation of motion mathbf ddot 1t mathbf mathbf 1t second equation is obtained for particle using the expressions for mathbf and mathbf instead the full equations are complicated so take limit as the mass of the nucleus goes to infinity and assuming my calculations are correct obtain simpler equation of motion formally identical to that of planetary motion around the sun this predicts elliptical trajectories for most initial conditions the concern is that the resulting motion is stable and this seems to contradict what the usual accounts say about classical electromagnetism failing to explain atomic orbit stability if you want more detail you can also read what wrote below suppose for moment that we work classically and use the planetary model for the atom hydrogen for simplicity as positively charged nucleus with negatively charged electron orbiting it in similar way that planets orbit around the sun the usual story goes that due to the electron orbiting around the nucleus it undergoes acceleration which will cause the electron to radiate electromagnetic waves the energy of this radiation is considered to be taken away over time from the electrons total energy via the larmor formula and therefore the model predicts collapse of the electrons orbit over short period of time because the radius of the orbit must decrease to compensate for the diminished energy of the electron at the risk of sounding ridiculous to more knowledgeable people would like to challenge this assumption with the following considerations only as way to clarify my own understanding of the problem it appears to me that this problem is arising only because we consider the electromagnetic field to have an existence independent of the charges generating it and carrying energy and momentum on its own but it seems possible to describe the fundamentals of classical electromagnetism without resorting to the concept of electromagnetic fields by the use of combination of the lorentz force law and the li nard wiechert potential in particular one can substitute the explicit expressions for the mathbf and mathbf fields obtained from the li nard wiechert formulas into the lorentz force formula to derive the force between two charged particles moving on arbitrary paths in space one can then derive classical equation of motion for the particles using newtonian mechanics or its special relativistic correction explicitly we obtain this system of two odes where are the masses and charges of the two particles mathbf 1t mathbf 2t are the paths and other quantities are defined in the wikipedia page for the li nard wiechert potential mathbf ddot frac mu 0c 2q 1q pi left1 left mathbf dot 1t times left frac mathbf 2t times right right right left frac mathbf 2t boldsymbol beta 2t gamma r1 mathbf 2t cdot boldsymbol beta 2t mathbf 1t mathbf 2t frac mathbf 2t times big mathbf 2t boldsymbol beta 2t times boldsymbol dot beta 2t big c1 mathbf 2t cdot boldsymbol beta 2t mathbf 1t mathbf 2t right mathbf ddot frac mu 0c 2q 1q pi left1 left mathbf dot 2t times left frac mathbf 1t times right right right left frac mathbf 1t boldsymbol beta 1t gamma r1 mathbf 1t cdot boldsymbol beta 1t mathbf 2t mathbf 1t frac mathbf 1t times big mathbf 1t boldsymbol beta 1t times boldsymbol dot beta 1t big c1 mathbf 1t cdot boldsymbol beta 1t mathbf 2t mathbf 1t right where mathbf 2t frac mathbf 1t mathbf 2t mathbf 1t mathbf 2t boldsymbol beta 2t frac mathbf dot 2t and gamma 2t frac sqrt boldsymbol beta 2t and similarly for mathbf 1t boldsymbol beta 1t and gamma 1t the retarded time is defined implicitly by the equation frac mathbf 1t mathbf 2t slightly abused notation by factoring out the cross product terms to avoid duplicating things hopefully this is clear enough this can be generalized to system of charged particles in similar way have not performed the calculations myself due to the apparent complexity of the resulting equation of motion but in principle one could check whether the solutions correspond to what is predicted with the electron spiraling down into the nucleus or whether it leads to something close to elliptical orbits my intuition tells me that we wont observe the kind of spiralling down predicted by assuming energy is stored in the electric fields throughout all of space in this setup instead we consider the mathbf and mathbf fields as useful mathematical abstractions to simplify the expression given above into more manageable components the interpretation of the poynting vector would be as energy flux density which would exist only if there exist other charges that would get accelerated by the fields in particular the atomic stability problem would require additional charges being present near the hydrogen atom which would obviously affect the electrons orbit through additional force terms as multi body problem in that scenario there would be an energy transfer between the electron and other charges nearby but even then it is not clear that the electron automatically loses energy because the nearby particles will in turn radiate and couple with the electrons motion we can simplify the equations above by assuming the mass of particle to be very large so that it remains effectively stationary in some inertial frame of reference and located at the origin then the equations above simplify greatly and we have the following equation of motion for particle with mathbf 2t mathbf mathbf ddot frac mu 0c 2q 1q pi frac mathbf 1t mathbf 1t which is just the equation of motion of charged particle moving in an electrostatic potential with the coulomb force this limiting model is formally identical to the model of planet orbiting massive object under newtonian gravitation and we clearly have elliptical orbits therefore it would be incorrect to claim that classical electromagnetism predicts instabilities of the atom in this limiting case with very massive nucleus at least if we dont consider the energy supposedly stored in the em fields also it deals away with the self energy problem of charged particle integrating the electrical field energy density over all spaces gives an infinite result which would be simply meaningless calculation since there is no actual energy stored in such field hope what said above was sufficiently clear and would be curious whether solutions to the equations of motion have described have been calculated or approximated somewhat to predict classical orbits of an electron around the nucleus note also that am not questioning the validity of quantum mechanics and more detailed theories of matter am simply wondering whether the specific problem of atomic instability supposedly predicted by classical electromagnetics arises only due to the assumed existence of electromagnetic fields carrying energy or whether field free formulation of electromagnetics using the equations of motion above is also subject to this problem am sure there are other problems that this model cannot resolve such as the existence of discrete atomic emission and absorption spectra but the important observation wanted to make is that starting from the classical maxwell equations and lorentz force we can derive the li nard wiechert potential and then derive the explicit equations of motion above and finally forget about the existence of the mathbf and mathbf fields this leads to classical model of two body atom with stable orbits
462707 this is statement that read mainly on books about electronics could someone explain why after the resistance current is what makes things work and not voltage example from the art of electronics of horowitz winfield roughly speaking resistors are used to convert voltage to current and vice versa this may sound awfully trite also it is common practice when someone is working with solenoid proportional valves resistance is added before the solenoid so that it shall be controlled by current and not voltage because voltage will drop in case that temperature will rise
462768 know that planets cant have infinite energy due to the law of conservation of energy however im confused because see contradiction and it would be great if someone could explain it energy is defined as the capacity to do work work is defined as force distance force is defined as mass acceleration thus if we accelerate mass for some distance by using some force we are doing work and we must have had energy in order to do that work in orbit planets change direction which is change in velocity which is an acceleration planets have mass and they are moving over particular distance thus work is being done to move the planets in an ideal world planets continue to orbit forever thus infinite work will be done on the planets as they orbit how can infinite work be done or finite work over an infinite time period if youd like to think of it that way with finite amount of energy where is the flaw in this argument
463293 there are skyscrapers sitting and pushing on the ground with tremendous weight is it possible to convert this weight force to harness energy to power the building maybe build the building on top of some type of pendulum that will rotate under the pressure and when one cycle of rotation reaches the equilibrium point we could give it kick from the stored energy to continue rotation was something like this created or tested and found useless note maybe my question should be is it possible to convert the potential energy of building into kinetic

464184 as an example we could talk about neuron cell in brain with size of mu being the distance between one neuron and next one in synaptic connection of around nm cdot reference according to my information atomic radius are around pm not very far of the synapse size factor of thus my question is could quantum mechanics be necessary to analyze biological scenarios such as neuron cell interaction etc ive read several examples about why take into account quantum effects as heisenbergs uncertainty principle is useless at the scale of usual objects say rocket but what about at the scale of cells

464265 im reviewing the book conquering the physics gre for my upcoming physics gre came across this problem which im having trouble with understanding in particular understand the solution that the author provides but dont understand what is wrong with my approach the electric field inside sphere of radius is given by hat textbf what is the total charge of the sphere the authors approach involving taking the divergence of the electric field to get the charge density and then integrating the density over the volume of the sphere to get charged enclosed which in their case turns out to be but we can also just use concentric sphere of radius le as gaussian surface and just use the integral form of maxwells equation to calculate the charge enclosed oint limits vec cdot vec frac enc epsilon since the area vector points in the radial direction if we assume it makes an angle theta with the electric field vector and given cos theta we have enc epsilon int limits pi int limits pi cos theta sin theta theta phi enc frac pi epsilon if we want the charge enclosed by the sphere we just set so we get frac pi epsilon which isnt zero im having trouble figuring out where im going wrong any suggestions appreciated

464451 it is said that atoms with the same number of electrons as protons are electrically neutral so they have no net charge or net electric field particle with charge cannot exist at the same position and time as another an electron cannot be positioned at the location of proton at any single point in time without displacing the proton assuming the above is correct how can single electron cancel out the entire electric field of proton dont think there is any position single electron can take that would result in the entire electric field of the proton being cancelled out it seems like it will always be only partially cancelled out for simplicity lets look at single hydrogen atom that we consider to be electrically neutral it has one proton and one electron so at any single point in time there will be partial net electric field because the electron will never be in position where its field can completely cancel out the protons field and the electric field from the electron will only cancel out part of the field from the proton so at this single point in time there will be net electric field from the proton so how can this atom be considered to be electrically neutral with no net charge or field here is graphical representation of two sources of electric fields interacting as you can see from the image only part of the equal but opposite electric fields produced by both sources are affected by each other to have the field from one source cancel out the other completely we would need to position the sources in the same location at the same time which is not possible know that im wrong so please correct me

466875 the qcd quark lagrangian in the chiral limit is bar not which possesses global su3 times su3 symmetry ive read many places that this is symmetry is spontaneously broken to su3 by langle bar rangle neq question how does this qualify as spontaneous symmetry breaking my understanding is that ssb would be of the form bar not overline gamma where is necessarily an su3 times su3 singlet could then see how langle bar rangle neq would induce mass term to the lagrangian however have only seen the statement that the qcd ground state respects only su3 hence we get goldstone bosons etc question ground state of what there is no potential what potential are we minimizing and whose vev we are expanding about conclusion to me this entire process just seems identical to explicit symmetry breaking but we are just calling it spontaneous to be able to use goldstones theorem so must be missing something

466916 we know that the speed of light depends on the density of the medium it is travelling through it travels faster through less dense media and slower through more dense media when we produce sound series of rarefactions and compressions are created in the medium by the vibration of the source of sound compressions have high pressure and high density while rarefactions have low pressure and low density if light is made to propagate through such disturbance in the medium does it experience refraction due to changes in the density of the medium why dont we observe this

468190 consider charged non conducting solid sphere of uniform charge density and it as hole of some radius at the centre now suppose apply gauss law as there is no charge inside the cavity no charge is enclosed by gaussian sphere so electric flux is zero hence electric field is zero but this is not true according to sources like this textbook etc what am missing here my question about how to have nonzero field in region where the flux through the boundary of the region vanish as mentioned by rob
468360 consider two charges and placed at distance note charge and are different in terms of magnitude my question is number of flux lines received by proportional to its own charge or does charge have anything to say at all as according to gauss law source of image britannica the lhs is dependant of field external to gaussian surface and and rhs of equation depends on charge enclosed within the gaussian surface
468891 nature article on reproducibility in science according to that article surprisingly large number of experiments arent reproducible or at least there have been failed attempted reproductions in one of the figures its said that of scientists in physics engineering have failed to reproduce someone elses results and have failed to reproduce their own clearly if something cannot be reproduced its veracity is called into question also clearly because theres only one particle accelerator with the power of the lhc in the world we arent able to independently reproduce lhc results in fact because of physics engineering experiments arent reproducible by the original scientists one might expect theres chance that if the people who originally built the lhc built another lhc they will not reach the same results how then do we know that the lhc results such as the discovery of the higgs boson are robust or do we not know the lhc results are robust and are effectively proceeding on faith that they are edit as pointed out by chris hayes in the comments misinterpreted the nature article it says that of physical scientists have failed to reproduce their own results which is not the same statement as of physics experiments arent reproducible this significantly eases the concern had when wrote the question im leaving the question here however because the core idea how can we know the lhcs results are robust when we only have one lhc remains the same and because innisfree wrote an excellent answer

469527 ive come across several references to the idea that to upgrade law of physics to general relativity all you have to do is replace any partial derivatives with covariant derivatives understand that covariant derivatives become partial derivatives in minkowski space however is the reverse unique is there no other tensor operation which becomes partial derivative if so why do we not mention them
469710 for real scalar field phi theory as simple as the phi theory can exhibit the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking ssb for complex scalar field phi theory as simple as the one described by potential of the form phi phi is capable of showing ssb why is it that simple quantum field theory containing only fermion field psi incapable of showing this feature of ssb added after dwaggs answer was bit sloppy in saying that theories with only fermions do not admit ssb in qcd there is chiral symmetry breaking which is related to nonzero vev of the operator bar for quark field but the route is not straightforward in classical field theories the standard way to check whether ssb has occurred is the following one has lagrangian with potential term phi when minimized the minimum of phi occurs at nonzero value of phi in qft one says that phi has got vev have not seen such straightforward route to understand qcd chiral symmetry breaking no such potential in the qcd lagrangian so the question is is there similar way of showing that nonzero vev of bar is possible by minimizing some effective potential bar of qcd for the gross neveu model in dwaggs answer there is already quartic term in the lagrangian and minimizing the potential bar psi psi can give rise to ssb such term is not there in qcd lagrangian

469869 the longest solar day of year is approximately hours min seconds occurs at mid to late december while the shortest solar day of year is approximately hour 59min seconds if average out both of these come up with average solar day of hour 4seconds why then it is said it is hours 0min seconds exactly wouldnt using hour solar day as definition of day cause the offset of seconds each solar year
469917 in the particular problem encountered an electric field was zero at the origin and we were meant to prove that particle at the origin was in an unstable state of equilibrium is it enough to state that for any non null coordinates the electric field isnt zero ergo the equilibrium is unstable or is there more elegant way of proving it
469932 im looking at buying some ice packs for my cooler looking specific brand they have several models each with different freezing temperature why does this matter lets say have one pack that freezes at and another that freezes at lets also assume they are the same mass lets say put both of these in my freezer that is at and leave them long enough that they both reach if then put each of them in identical coolers wont they have the same cooling capacity one may cool faster than the other but on long enough timeline theyll both cool the cooler to the same temperature assuming that the cooler is insulated enough that heat into the cooler is slower than heat into the ice pack

470202 the entropy of system is defined as ln omega what precisely is omega it refers to the number of microstates of the system but is this the number of all accessible microstates or just the number of microstates corresponding to the systems current macrostate or is it something else that eludes me
470316 it is often said that while many fermions cannot occupy the same state bosons have the tendency to do that sometimes this is expressed figuratively by saying for example that bosons are sociable or that bosons want to stay as close as possible understand that the symmetry of the wavefunction allows many bosons to be in the same one particle state but cant see why they should prefer to do that rather than occupying different states anyway according to many science writers bosons not only can be in the same state but they also tend to do that why is it like that
470376 up charm and top seem to be similar in terms of electric charge 3e while down strange and bottom have also same charge 3e in the second and third family positively charged quark has higher mass while in the first family negatively charged quark is heavier is there particular reason why up quark is lighter than down quark while in other two families charm is heavier than strange and top is also heavier than bottom

470922 questions of the form an electron and positron collide with mev of energy what is the frequency of the photons released quite often come up in my level course for often fairly arbitrary but this got me thinking there is energy stored in the separation of an electron and positron which as they get closer and closer together should all be converted into kinetic energy as the potential is of the form frac this implies that at arbitrarily small distances and arbitrarily high amount of energy is given off given that both electrons and positrons are typically regarded as point particles in order for them to collide they would have to be arbitrarily close together which would imply that over the course of their collision they should have released arbitrarily high amounts of energy in the form of kinetic energy as this would imply photons of arbitrarily high frequency given off assume that must have missed out some piece of physics somewhere but am uncertain where ideas have had so far include energy should be given off anyway by an accelerating electron in the form of light according to classical em although dont know how this changes from classical to quantum ideas of em we certainly cant have all the energy given off in continuous stream because we need quantised photons so does the electron itself experience quantised energy levels as it accelerates inwards my only issue with treating the electron in such quantised way is that to my mind itd be equivalent of treating it mathematically as hydrogen like atom where the probability of the electron colliding with the positron is still extremely low and unlike electron capture thered be no weak force interaction to mediate this electron positron atom the actual mechanism for the decay occurs at non zero separation distance perhaps photons pass between the two particles to mediate the decay at non infinitesimal distances at relativistic speeds our classical model of electrodynamics breaks down now know this to be true considering the fact that magnetism is basically the relativistic component of electrodynamics however given the fact that magnetism is the only relativistic force whichd be involved dont see how itd act to counteract this infinite release of energy so is there another force which im forgetting these are just ideas ive come up with whilst thinking about the problem and dont know if any of them have any physical significance in this problem so any advice is appreciated
471037 why are so many energies in our universe mathematically represented by the equation frac ab for example kinetic energy frac mv energy stored in capacitor frac cv energy stored in an inductor frac li these are just some can remember off the top of my head remember that there are more like this is this just coincidence or is there reason behind this tried to google it but couldnt find any relevant results
471753 after the revelation of the first black hole images it seems there is bias towards the south side is it because of measuring it from earth or is it something more fundamental in the understanding of gravitation
472000 if the nucleus is densely positively charged why don the protons in the nucleus repel from each other and move towards the orbiting electrons because each proton is not only being repelled by the other protons it is also being pulled by the oppositely charged electrons why don these conditions make the atomic model impossible understand that electrons are in energy levels start so cannot force their way into the nucleus but why not the reverse
472159 what force causes entropy to increase realize that the second law of thermodynamics requires the entropy of system to increase over time for example gas stored in canister if opened inside vacuum chamber will expand to fill the chamber but not clear on what force exactly is acting upon the molecules of gas that causes them to fly out of the opened canister and fill the chamber just looking for concise explanation as to what is going on at the fundamental level since obviously the second law of thermodynamics is not force and therefore does not cause anything to happen
472372 the first ever image of black hole released this week was taken with radio telescopes suggesting that it is false color image and doesnt represent what person would see in reality or visible light this seems to be confirmed by this wired article but am perplexed as to why this is not widely mentioned including the announcement on the telescopes official website and wikipedia image file article on black holes perhaps not mentioning it makes for better headlines but it feels wrong whats going on here
472483 when an ice cube is immersed in water at room temperature how is the thermal energy from the water transferred to the ice cube currently have two answers infrared radiation from the water transfers thermal energy to the ice cube which increases the ice cube particles ke store breaking the intermolecular bonds of the ice cube melting it the brownian motion of the water particles causes them to collide with the ice cube transferring ke to the ice cubes particles increasing temperature breaking intermolecular bonds and melting it

472755 in radiotherapy the goal is to kill as many cancer cells in localised area without killing normal cells right so what possible reason would there be to use gamma irradiation over alpha irradiation gamma is not as good at ionising and damaging cells and atoms that make them up as alpha is it is also very good transmitting through hard and soft surfaces so gamma irradiation results in much more collateral damage than alpha irradiation alpha particles are absorbed easily and cause more damage to cells so why are gamma waves used instead of alpha particles in radiotherapy
472900 am curious about how much radiation do experimental nuclear physics researchers students suffer in nowadays research environment know this may be dumb question but have can found answer nowhere
473061 noticed that have been bending my book all along when was reading it with one hand this also works for plane flexible sheets of any material illustration using an a4 sheet without bending the sheet with bend along perpendicular axis how do you explain this sturdiness that comes only when the object is bent along the perpendicular axis feel that this is problem related to the elastic properties of thin planes but any other versions are also welcome

473330 lets say was at the very center of the enormous bo tes void way out in deep deep space what could see with the naked eye assume could see no individual stars but could resolve any galaxies if gazed in the direction of super cluster of galaxies would it seem brighter than other directions how dark would it be compared to say the far side of the moon when it is full moon on earth am told there are in fact few galaxies in the void so lets say pick spot in the void that is as far from any of those galaxies as possible
473932 in dark room there are two people and very faint candle then the candle emits one photon is it true that only one person can see the photon why and are there any experiments edit thanks lot was originally asking about quantum mechanical things because believe such an experiment will turn the two people into schrodingers cat thats weird because it is not likely for macroscope object get correlated so easily now thanks to the answers realized that the efficiency and noise is as bad as in cases of other quantum mechanical processes
474020 recently had my second lecture in thermodynamics long lecture which involved the first law and portion of the second law at some point during the lecture we defined entropy as the change of heat energy per unit temperature from this we derived general expression for entropy using laws derived for ideal gases in which it was clear that it depended on the change of temperature and volume through the process as well as the number of moles have also learned that entropy is measure of disorder in system which was nonsense to me especially that dont understand how disorder chaotic movement of particles is related to the change in heat energy per unit temperature its more related to specific heat if you ask me nonetheless in attempts to understand whats useful in knowing whats the amount of disorder in system learnt that it measures the state of reversibility of the process which still doesnt make sense when trying to relate it with the change in heat energy per unit temperature tl dr need an answer these questions process has an entropy of what does this tell me another process has higher entropy what does this tell me how can relate the definition of entropy to change in heat energy per unit time please dont explain using statistical thermodynamics
474105 does the universe have fixed centre of mass if it does doesnt it necessarily mean that every action of ours has to be balanced by counteraction somewhere in the universe so as to neutralize the disbalance of mass
474428 from acoustics we know that sound is an elastic pressure wave what our human senses perceive are loudness and pitch which are related to the amplitude and the frequency while pitch can easily be expressed with the regular units of hz the convention a440 means that the note has frequency of hz and all others can be obtained through the well temperament this is not the case for loudness the most common units for loudness are decibels db which are defined through logarithm on the pressure find this to be counter intuitive think that expressing sound waves in units of pressure left frac right left frac right would make more sense there is critical amplitude for which the valley reaches the negative atmospheric and you have vacuum if had known this previously would have asked my professor if this was the maximum value for the amplitude or if wave becomes asymmetric beyond this point the critical value changes with different atmospheric pressure for example it would be lower at higher altitude from this follows that loud sounds are different at different altitudes it would make it more compatible with the standard units for luminosity in electromagnetic waves the lumen lm is proportional to the radiative power rather than some logarithm why is the use of decibels so widespread when these points make it clear that using pascals or psi would be better am missing something thank you very much
474449 am taking ap physics right now im high school student and we are learning about circuits current resistance voltage ohms law etc am looking for exact definitions of what current voltage and resistance are my teacher as im sure most physics teachers do compared wire with current flowing through it to pipe with water flowing through it the thinner the pipe the more resistance the more water pressure the more voltage and the faster the water travels the higher the current took these somewhat literally and assumed that current is literally the velocity of electrons voltage is the pressure etc my physics teacher said that the analogy to the water pipe is only really used for illustrative purposes im trying to figure out exactly what current resistance and voltage are because cant really work with vague analogy that kind of applies and kind of doesnt did some research and found this page which provided decent explanation but was slightly lost in the explanation given let me know if this question has already been asked again remember dont want an analogy want concrete definition edit note when say exact definition simply mean definition that does not require an analogy to me an exact definition for term applies to every use case whether am talking about series circuit parallel circuit or electric current within cell the exact definition should apply to all of them and make sense

476175 the three dimensional laplacian can be defined as nabla frac partial partial frac partial partial frac partial partial expressed in spherical coordinates it does not have such nice form but could define different operator lets call it laspherian which would simply be the following bigcirc frac partial partial rho frac partial partial theta frac partial partial phi this looks nice in spherical coordinates but if tried to express the laspherian in cartesian coordinates it would be messier mathematically both operators seem perfectly valid to me but there are so many equations in physics that use the laplacian yet none that use the laspherian so why does nature like cartesian coordinates so much better or has my understanding of this gone totally wrong

476554 so was going through callens thermodynamics book and their he says that thermodynamics is only applicable to systems which are in equilibrium and that naturally raised few questions in my mind is thermodynamics really never applicable to systems which are not in equilibrium if so why should such restriction exist and also it might sound silly but why is the theory called thermodynamics specifically the dynamics part
476627 the naming of doped semiconductors as type for donor doped and type for acceptor doped is ubiquitous but am having hard time digging up where this naming tradition comes from and how it has come to be so widely accepted from my perspective there is nothing intuitive about this choice of notation henceforth the question where does the tradition of labelling donor doped extrinsic semiconductors as and acceptor doped as come from
476764 the following was stated in general relativity lecture series full space is needed in gr minkowski space is sufficient for sr however minkowski space is sufficient to compute properties of free falling bodies sr is sufficient to do frame transformations between an object falling on black hole orbiting black hole and travelling by inertia in intergalactic space even more so gyroscope cannot help one to distinguish orbits and is this statement correct
476796 considering volume and particle number constant the internal energy is function of the entropy us the temperature is then defined as dus ds from here the temperature is function of the entropy ts one can now define the free energy ft as ft ts ust tst for this however ts has to be invertable my question is what happens if us is some wavy function such that its derivative is the same at many distinct values in other words what happens if ts has multiple solutions for is it possible not to have well defined temperature at equilibrium my wild guess is that this shouldnt happen in the thermodynamic limit but cant see this also small even single particle systems have well defined temperature so is there some constraint on the shape of us im missing here
476966 protons and neutrons which are found in everyday matter around us compose of up and down quarks are the other two generations of quarks cstb quarks found in everyday matter around us am learning about these fundamental particles and would like to know how they relate to our daily life are they mostly irrelevant to our daily life except in extreme physical conditions like in the particle colliders
476987 thought and read about color mixing today made some counterintuitive discoveries and now have some thought experiments which cannot test could print yellow image but use different printing technique on each half on the left side use color which is true yellowso yellow pigments which reflect yellow wavelength on the right use small red and green squares next to each othernot overlapping which from afar appear also as the same yellow so both sides appear yellow to me because my cone cells on my retina are tricked if am now holding monochromatic yellow filter in front of me the right side would appear black because red and green cant get trough the filter and the left side would be still the same yellow so could now distinguish between the left and right side so my question is what would see when took multiple monochromatic filters with me and look around are there materials which appear specific color because they areso that the atoms absorb every other color or just emits this specific color and some materials which reflect or emit different wavelenghts which then appear as specific color
477111 in the book of goldstein at page while deriving the hamiltons equations canonical equations he argues that the canonical momentum was defined in eq as partial partial dot substituting this into the lagrange equation we obtain dot frac partial partial tag so eq can be written as dl dot dq id dot frac partial partial dt tag the hamiltonian hqpt is generated by the legendre transformation hqpt dot lq dot tag which has the differential dh dot dot frac partial partial tag where the term dot is removed by the legendre transformation since dh can also be written as dh frac partial partial frac partial partial frac partial partial tag however if is defined to be function of qpt then how can we define hqpt dot lq dot qt dot is not an argument of whereas it is in its definition moreover when he is taking the differential of he argues that pd dot is removed but he does not say why mean mathematically speaking this whole argument is plan wrong as far as can see so assuming that it is not the case what am missing in here
477214 it is being said that gravitational wave detectors are now able to distinguish neutron star waves from those originating from black holes two questions how do ligo and virgo know that gravitational wave has its origin in neutron star or black hole if their gravitational fields except for their intensity are identical in that space beyond the radius that defines them is this identification accurate and reliable
477403 im learning bit about sound and was wondering if the speed of sound is determined by the amount of matter the source is surrounded with why doesnt it go through wall example speed of sound in air is but in water it moves at because of the increase of matter surrounding it and since iron has more tightly packed matter it moves even faster because its moving the matter to move the vibrations if this is true why doesnt the sound go through walls is it because it loses its strength for the amount it travels
477425 in newtonian mechanics binaries are stable we here on earth are very glad that it will not emit its angular momentum and spiral into the sun what is different about the black holes and neutron stars that ligo virgo are detecting which makes them spiral inwards
477602 ive completed full year qm course undergraduate level and am left confused on where to draw the line between quantum mechanics theory and its interpretations would personally like to stick to no interpretation at all but since do not know what is interpretation and what isnt it is extremely hard to stick to this rule many introductory books do not mention if they use particular interpretation at all and suspect they do use some interpretations here and there without any warning nor notice from what have read on the internet the collapse or reduction of the wave function is part of interpretations of qm not all interpretations assume there is even such thing as collapse of psi good thats an easy one but what about what psi represents for example ive commonly read that its modulus squared represents the probability density of finding the particles at particular positions and times but does such description already assume an interpretation what about the qm postulates is there any interpretation hidden in one or more of these postulates ive read several lubos motls posts here on pse and on his own blog and to him and apparently many others such as john rennie and zurek psi is entirely subjective and two observers of the same quantum system need not to use the same psi to describe the system but no mention of any interpretation is ever done suspect they use some interpretation to make such claims but couldnt get the information from skimming through many books including one by zurek called quantum theory and measurement which is package of many qm papers and one such paper by london around page seemed to agree with the motls description have heard of the shut up and calculate approach but have read on wikipedia that its associated to the copenhagen interpretation is that really so have read from the member alephzero that qm works perfectly well without any interpretation quoting him wave function collapse is not part of qm it is only part of some interpretations of qm in particular the copenhagen interpretation the fact that this interpretation is used in lot of pop science writing about qm doesnt make it an essential part of qm to quote david mermin just shut up and calculate note afaik there is no so called standard interpretation of qm it works perfectly well as theory of physics with no interpretation at all my question is how on earth do we draw the line between qm theory and its interpretations the books seem completely blurry in that aspect and almost any other sources could find too
477659 was doing physics problem and it seemed simple at first but now it doesnt at all and need help here it is three identical spheres are thrown from the same height above the ground sphere is thrown vertically up sphere is thrown horizontally and sphere is thrown vertically down all three spheres are thrown with the same speed air resistance is negligible which sphere or spheres initially because they bounce so it means the first bounce collide with the ground with the greatest speed so all spheres are height above the ground and thrown at the same speed is thrown straight up is thrown straight right and is thrown straight down so went about doing it normally first noting that will go up and then come back down with the same exact velocity as so thought it was simple and both hit the ground with the greatest speed then looked at the answer and had gotten it wrong turned out the answer said that all of them hit the ground at the same speed so thought about it and realized had just forgotten that horizontal speed counts too is thrown to the side and that velocity adds on to the speed and so it does hit the ground with the same speed felt satisfied that had learned where my mistake was fast forward day and randomly start thinking about it again then as think about it realize that cant hit the ground at the same speed because of the pythagorean theorem my reasoning was that sphere will have separate components of its velocity when it hits the ground it will have velocity to the right and velocity that it gained from falling which should be sqrt 2gh if that matters so points to the right and points down to get the total speed of sphere we should use the pythagorean theorem and get sqrt so worked this out and thought oh the answer must be wrong but kept looking because didnt think they would be wrong and me right what are the odds so then tried to solve it using energy and got their answer because at the beginning all of the spheres have potential energy sgh and kinetic energy frac sv where is the mass of the spheres this means that their energies sx sy and sz must all be the same at the end when the spheres are about to bounce off of the ground their potential energies must all be zero because they are at the ground so there is no gravitational potential energy which means that their kinetic energy must all be the same as there were no non conservative forces involved so im getting contradictory answers kinematics says has less velocity and energy says it has the same velocity am very confused and im sure mustve made mistake somewhere so if somebody could please help me would really appreciate it if that was bit confusing and you need any clarification just ask me also this is my first question on so so if did anything wrong feel free to tell me
477712 ive just started studying vectors understand because photon has rest mass and travels at you can not define velocity for it and as momentum vector mass velocity vector it should be for photon but we know photon as momentum equal to frac hbar so how come we still say that the magnitude of the momentum vector is and not this

478060 we all have elaborative discussion in physics about classical mechanics as well as interaction of particles through forces and certain laws which all particles obey want to askdoes particle exert force on itself edit thanks for the respectful answers and comments edited this question in order to make it more elaborated just want to convey that assumed the particle to be standard model of point mass in classical mechanics as dont know why there is minimum requirement of two particles to interact with fundamental forces of naturein the similar manner wanted to ask does particle exerts force on itself
478132 suppose we have two hydrogen atoms in the ground state with spin of both electrons pointing upwards then the two electrons are in the same state this should be against the exclusion principle now suppose we have mole of hydrogen atoms in chamber certainly most of them will be in the ground state at sufficiently low temperature and among any three of those in the ground state at least two will have spin in the same directions hence the two electrons are in the same state how is the exclusion principle valid for those two electrons my doubt is mostly about which parameters determine state suppose two different hydrogen atoms having the same quantum numbers are in different points in space are the two electrons in the same state

478429 lets say meteor is coming towards earth its not accelerating but it does have an initial velocity this meteor is shaped so it has an insane amount of drag enough to even exceed its weight not mass as it gets closer what happens why at first thought it would just stop but that doesnt really make sense the forces cancel but that doesnt mean the body slows down would it keep going in another direction
478538 lets say we have an electron around atom lets say the electron drops into lower electron shell is of the energy difference converted to photon does the atom recoil at all is the any of the energy lost to any other means
479055 was taught that when the acceleration experienced by body is constant that body follows parabolic curve this seems logical because constant acceleration means velocity that is linear and position that is quadratic this is what learned from projectiles bodies are thrown with an initial velocity near the surface of the earth they experience constant acceleration and the result is parabolic curve now that doesnt apply to the orbit of the earth the gravitational force can be thought of as constant since the distance from the earth to the sun can be thought of as constant too which by newtons second law means the acceleration of earth is also constant wouldnt that mean that the earth should just follow parabolic path is there mathematical proof similar to the one mentioned about projectiles giving the elliptical orbit as result my question is in word why cant the earth be treated as projectile and if it can then why doesnt it behave like one
479082 when create double slit in mirror by removing the paint and silver get beautiful interference pattern what interesting to me is that get one in the opposite direction too what has me puzzled even more is that the reflected one never passes through the slits yet it produces beautiful interference pattern equal in brightness and definition to the one that actually goes through the slits even when turn the mirror around where the paint side is facing the laser still get clear pattern in both directions when simply use painted glass get the same results this has me so perplexed that created youtube video showing what happening https youtu be lellrpmgoye what going on wave simulator apps do not show congruent waves reflecting in both directions
479472 spaceship which uses centripetal rotation to create artificial gravity must it always be accelerating the rate of rotation for it to work if no and even if yes if one were to place themselves right at the center of this spinning structure would one feel no gravity if one were to be moving from part of the ship with no centripetal rotation and thus gravity to the part with it what would the experience be like transitioning would one technically be able to just fly over the entire rotating thing if you never touched it in the first place image sorry for the poor drawing should mention that the opening is connected just to the edge of the spinning living section so that this window is almost perfectly centered around this spinning living space if you think of this living space as circle he is in the center the door description person coming from the gravity part of the ship about to enter the centripetal rotation large living space but doing so from high point would they be superman
479515 have noticed that in my country india most of the solar panels are tilted southward at an angle of circ even on buildings with inverted shaped roofs solar panels are still oriented southward on both the sides of roof research many sites suggests that the tilt aids in self cleaning also another site stated that tilt depends on factor like latitude my questions why are solar panels tilted southward how is latitude of the location of solar panel relevant in increasing efficiency
479656 in most textbooks dot product between two vectors is defined as langle 1x 2x rangle cdot langle 1y 2y rangle understand how this definition works most of the time however in this definition there is no reference to coordinate system no basis is included for the vector components so if had two vectors in two different coordinate systems vec vec vec vec vec vec how would compute their dot product in particular is there more formal abstract generalized definition of the dot product that would allow me to compute vec cdot vec without converting the vectors to the same coordinate system even if did convert the vectors to the same coordinate system why do we know that the result will be the same if multiply the components in the primed system versus in the unprimed system
480113 so the second episode of the hbo series began to cover the risk of steam explosion that led to them sending three divers into the water below the reactor to drain the tanks this occurred after the initial explosion that destroyed the reactor and after the fire in the core had been put out but at this point the decay heat and remaining fission reaction kept the core at more than causing it to melt through the concrete floors below the reactor and below the reactor were water tanks which contained cubic meters of water according to the tv show if anyone has real figure id love to hear when the lava of the melted core hit it it would cause an enormous steam explosion finally my question about how large would this explosion have been the character in the show says megatons of tnt equivalent assume im pretty sure this is absurd and impossible but real estimates are hard to come by other sources vary wildly some repeating the megatons idea and others saying it wouldve level ed square kilometers this still seems crazy tl dr know lot of it hinges on unknowns and the dynamics of the structures and materials involved so can simplify it to constrained physics question assuming cubic meters of water instantly flashes to steam how much potential energy is momentarily stored in that volume of steam occupying the same volume as the water did dont know what to assume the temperature of the steam is there were hundreds of tons of core material at temperatures near so worst case scenario you could assume all the steam becomes that temperature as the materials mix best case scenario guess we could assume normal atmospheric boiling point
480163 am an undergraduate physics student completing my first year shortly the following question is based on the physical systems ve encountered so far we mostly did newtonian mechanics in all of our analyses of the physical systems up till now we recklessly exploited taylor series retaining terms up to the desired precision of our approximate model of reality but what is the justification of using taylor series it implicitly implies that the mathematical functions in our physical model are analytic but how can we be sure about that sure the nature doesn seem to be discontinuous or have kinks nonexistent derivatives in its behaviour that seems plausible but still there are non analytic smooth functions and there are many more of them than there are analytic functions so even if the nature works smoothly in its endeavours it is essentially zero probability that it should do so analytically so why do we use taylor series at all
480190 was wondering about the roche limit and its effects on satellites why arent artificial satellites ripped apart by gravitational tidal forces of the earth think its due to the satellites being stronger than rocks is this true also is the roche limit just line very narrow band around the planet or is it range broad cross sectional area of distance around the planet
480324 how can we know that the electromagnetic tensor mu nu can be written in terms of four vector potential mu as mu nu partial mu nu partial nu mu in the vector calculus approach this is not really hard to see under reasonable smoothness conditions on the fields but would like to know how one would see this in the four vector approach more specifically how can we prove mathematically that given the electromagnetic tensor there exists four vector such that mu nu partial mu nu partial nu mu
480510 many questions have been asked on this site about the stern gerlach experiment but as far as can tell this one hasnt does the following classical explanation of the sg experiment work model electrons as finite sized hollow sphere of rotating charge immediately after entering the sg device the dipole moment of the electron quickly reorients itself to align with the magnetic field of the device this is what would expect to happen if small bar magnet were placed in region of high magnetic field gradient suppose this happens before the electron has traveled of the distance of the device then for the remaining of the distance in the sg device the electron is completely oriented either spin up or spin down so the binary all or nothing measurement is naturally predicted by this classical picture this would also work to explain sending the beam through multiple differently oriented sg devices since the previous spin orientation of the electron is completely altered very quickly each time the electron enters new device edit dont think was clear enough about the overall point of the question since few people have now brought up the fact that the spherical electron model has issues im aware of that but not really concerned with the specific electron structure model so much as why some classical model wouldnt work to describe the binary output beam behavior which knzhou gave very nice answer to perhaps better hypothetical classical model would be classical point particle with intrinsic angular momentum magnetic dipole moment the correct gyromagnetic ratio supposing this could be tunable classical parameter for point particles and some braking mechanism that allows it to quickly align with magnetic field and stay aligned think this question matters because the sg experiment is often used as pedagogical example of quantum mechanics in introductory courses when first learned qm remember being confused about why this example was supposed to be so convincing since it seemed that there could exist classical explanations of it
480656 as beginner of classical electrodynamics am quite confused in understanding kirchhoffs junction law or it may be the reason that misunderstood the law of conservation of charge please correct me if am wrong understood the law of conservation of charge as follows the net charge of an isolated system will always remain constant by isolated system think that it is system in which we cant take out any charge from it as well as we cant add any charge to it now considering kirchhoffs junction law imagine junction of wires at which is part of an electric circuit when the switch is open then no current passes through consider as my system my teacher told me that the junction law is just the other form of law of conservation of charge taking junction as the system when the switch is closed then current flows through it and when we apply the law of conservation of charge at then we arrive at the junction law now my question is how can we apply law of conservation of charge at because is not an isolated system dont think that it is an isolated system as when switch is turned on then we cant write the equation using law of conservation of charge so think that kirchhoffs junction law violates the law of conservation of charge am correct or totally wrong
480938 when we measure the speed of light we get the same answer in all directions this is taken to undermine the aether or absolute motion hypothesis and give support to the proposal that the speed of light is invariant from which derives the theory of special relativity but doesnt the fact that we only measure speed of light there and back undermine this conclusion wouldnt we expect this result through an aether
481037 if so have read that for and for an incompressible gas are identical in heat transfer by yunus cengel then how will the relation between and hold for an ideal gas
481149 in my understanding the center of the earth is hot because of the weight of the its own matter being crushed in on itself because of gravity we can use water to collect this heat from the earth and produce electricity with turbines however id imagine that doing this at an enormous impossibly large scale would not cool the center of the earth to the same temperature as the surface since gravity is still compressing the rock together however since energy cannot be created or destroyed it seems like this energy is just coming from nowhere doubt the earths matter is being slowly consumed to generate this energy or that the sun is somehow causing the heating think that have misunderstood or overlooked some important step in this process if so why or why not does the earths center heat up and if not does geothermal energy production cool it down irreversibly
481302 in this lecture nathan seiberg topics in dimensional quantum field theories nathan seiberg says theres no space in qm and therefore fermions have spin this sounds pretty revolting and the audience is confused too think we all had many spin systems in qm where electrons carry spin so what does he mean is it because theres only time derivative in the schr dinger equation hbar partial psi psi and the hamiltonian is an abstract object independent of any space representations
481557 have read this question electromagnetic gravity where safesphere says in comment actually photons themselves dont bend spacetime intuitively this is because photons cant emit gravitons because as any massless particles not experiencing time photons cant decay by emitting anything the latest theoretical results show that the gravitational field of photon is not static but gravitational wave emanating from the events of the emission and absorption of the photon thus the spacetime is bent by the charged particles emitting or absorbing photons but not by the photons themselves if photon can bend spacetime how does it exchange graviton is there experimental evidence that massless particles such as photons attract massive objects where john rennie says as far as know there has been no experimental evidence that light curves spacetime we know that if gr is correct it must do and all the experiments weve done have so far confirmed the predictions made by gr so it seems very likely that light does indeed curve spacetime now this cannot be right one of them says photons do bend spacetime since they do have stress energy but it is hard to measure it since the energy they carry is little compared to astronomical bodys stress energy so they do bend spacetime it is just that it is hard to measure it with our currently available devices now the other one says that photons do not bend spacetime at all it is only the emitting charge fermion that bends spacetime which one is right do photons bend spacetime themselves because they do have stress energy or do they not
481634 is that something we could do if we use ion or nuclear thrusters wouldnt people in the station reach speed of light in just years accelerating at 1g and effectively travel into the future by years that would be great experiment and very effective way to show relativity theory in action mean the people inside the station would have effectively traveled into the future how cool is that why havent it been done yet
482014 my family members dislike the idea of having many devices communicating wirelessly in our house arguing that the signals have negative effects on our physical health would like to tell them the em signals are in fact weaker than the light from our lights but could not really confirm this could someone tell me how strong the signals from the wireless devices are compared to those from lights and perhaps those from the sun as well how about the signals for radio devices and handphones what is the scientific basis for claiming the radiation has or doesnt have effects on the human body
483607 hope you will understand me correctly because there are some things that translated it is known that we see the world around us thanks to photons that are reflected from the surfaces of objects so have the following question if you imagine for example huge gray column meters from the eyes why are the photons reflected off this column flying straight into your eyes all the time while youre looking mean is it some huge stream flying in all directions parts of which will necessarily fall into the eyes how does this stream not mix with others what does that even look like an infinite number of randomly intersecting and moving points how do we distinguish which photons are reflected from what
483912 when light refracts in prism it creates rainbow my question is why don all windows or transparent objects create this dispersion why is the refractive index dependent on frequency in dispersive prism and not in window my guess is that the refractive index doesn change as much but don really have an idea

484026 in the miniseries chernobyl ordinary objects are depicted as being capable of becoming radioactive such as clothes water stones how exactly does something composed of non radioactive mass become radioactive im aware of the differences between alpha beta and gamma radiation and know how ionizing radiation works however it isnt clear to me how any radiation including ionizing radiation makes something radioactive in any long lasting sense of the word can imagine that ionizing radiation excites the atoms in the object which makes the atom emit photon until it becomes relaxed again however this doesnt sound like something that has very long lasting effect can also imagine that radioactive particles such as those from may stick to clothes or contaminate water however this too seems not that plausible is there really that much in nuclear reactor for dust particles to be considerable problem in this regard im not arguing that this isnt true it simply isnt clear to me how the mechanism behind it works im pretty sure this isnt clear to most non physicists either
484065 what understand in simple dc circuits this is product of the current and voltage such that watt ampere volt understand that watt is unit of power change in energy per unit time that describes the rate at which physical work can be done reactive power is power for which current flow occurs and that isnt actually used by the source even though its not used by the destination the intermediate current flow causes transmission losses which is why its undesirable hence why power factor correction exists and why utility companies bill non residential customers for low power factor what dont understand is reactive power truly unusable suppose had magnet coil in fictitious ac circuit that is purely capacitive reactive with no resistive component at all it would exhibit purely reactive power flow wouldnt the coil produce changing magnetic field that can use to deflect nearby magnet converting electric energy into kinetic energy are watt and volt amperes dimensionally equivalent just like km and miles hour if so would using watts to denote apparent power be technically correct and merely wrong by convention if thats the case then my understanding that va is used instead of because it has documenting purpose by commenting exactly how these watts can be used but this sounds strange because then it seems like not all watts are created equal know this question has been asked before but none of the as found answered the precise points of confusion had
484543 cant say confidently that an atom is mostly vacuum but am somewhat sure of it because electrons and nucleons cover little space and everything other than these elementary particles in an atom is vacuum why is everything around us rigid even if the atom is mostly vacuum edit the question over which this question is marked duplicate has completely different premise as compared to this question as this question asks about rigidity of materials around us rather than interaction between things around us and their subsequent behavior that they do not pass through each other
484642 consider linear combination of terms written using einstein notation consider one free index in the linear combination is it necessary that the index is upper in all terms or lower in all terms or not equivalently is it possible to have the same free index but in one term it is upper index and in the other it is lower index for example is it possible to have the following expression mu mu or this is forbidden in einstein notation and one free index can only appear upper in all terms or lower in all terms

485037 the celsius unit is arbitrarily defined based on the boiling and freezing point of water is it coincidence then that the si unit of temperature kelvin which is used in all natural equations has the same length as the celsius unit
485091 if rocket in space fires its thrusters it is propelled forwards as per the laws of motion this can be measured by its position relative to other bodies in the universe hypothetically if there was universe that was completely empty except for the rocket and it then fired its thrusters surely the same forces would apply even if its movement could not be measured just because we can measure an event is that the same thing as saying that it never happened is it correct to say that the rocket didn move

485816 this problem is from khan academy specifically for the blue point circled in red the answer is that at this blue point the object is neither speeding up nor slowing down when think about the rule about the signs of velocity and acceleration and what this means for change in speed this makes sense if velocity and acceleration and have the same sign the object is speeding up and if velocity and acceleration have opposite signs the object is slowing down at the blue point the instantaneous velocity is zero and because zero is neither positive nor negative the object is neither speeding up nor slowing down however intuitively this doesnt make sense at the blue point circled in red the velocity is zero so the speed must be zero also the slope of the function at this blue point is negative so acceleration is negative meaning that velocity is decreasing every second if velocity is decreasing every second then right after seconds the velocity will turn negative but the speed will have increased so at the blue point the object even though it has zero speed is in the process of speeding up why is this thinking wrong
486157 consider system of two charged particles text ve and text ve lets assume that the negatively charged particle revolves around the positively charged particle due to the force of attraction vec between them in this system the force causing the negatively charged particle to accelerate is internal but it changes the direction of velocity vec of the negatively charged particle this means that the linear momentum of the negatively charged particle vec vec is also changing and is not constant is this violation of the law of conservation of momentum
486168 im sorry if this question may seem wrong in many cases what would happen if we had wire with the length of kilometer that connected the two terminals of the battery do electrons care if the other end of the wire is the positive terminal or do they just flow inside the wire no matter whats at the other end of it until they are exhausted what would happen if we connected battery not to itself but to another terminal that drains it and never reconnect it to the positive terminal does the battery deplete or does it stop working care to explain heres related question that wasnt answered in detail thanks
486197 we are sending huge amount of debris into space from earth and also very heavy satellites and rockets then the mass of earth must be decreasing over time if the mass will decrease then gravitational attraction between earth and sun must decrease and its angular momentum must decrease which would result in greater orbit of earth and earth being cooler over the time but instead the temperature of earth is increasing why is it so
486300 recently read an interesting article that states that human being can perceive flash of as few as or so photons and the human eye itself can perceive even single photon the brain will filter this out however wanted to calculate how far away youd have to be standing from our sun for not single one of its photons to be hitting your pupil over given second the first thing did was assume that the sun emits photons per second because well thats the only number could find through internet research the next step is to assume that the average angle between photons emitted from the sun is pretty much the same and is equal to degrees the next step is to assume that the average human pupil diameter is meters and then draw triangle like so the length of the white line through the center of the triangle equals the distance at which two photons from the sun would be further apart than your pupil is wide meaning not even one photon should hit your eye broke the triangle into two pieces and solved for the white line by using the law of sines and my final result is ridiculous meters is the length of the white line for reference thats over times the diameter of the observable universe my conclusion says that no matter how far you get from the sun within our observable universe not only should some of the photons be hitting your pupil but it should be more than enough for you to visually perceive but if was right id probably see lot more stars from very far away every night when looked up at the sky why is my calculation inconsistent with what see

486790 is single radon daughter atom in air solid the wikipedia article on radon says unlike the gaseous radon itself radon daughters are solids and stick to surfaces such as dust particles in the air if such contaminated dust is inhaled these particles can also cause lung cancer the statement made me wonder about the right terminology is single radon daughter atom in air like 218po solid or gas would think it is gas because it resembles vapor atom or sublimated atom from solid and maybe it is potential solid
486859 im reading mathematical aspects of classical and celestial mechanics second edition by arnold kozlov and neishtadt it occurred to me that many people like to use third power when mention the law of universal gravitation for example ij frac gamma ij ij where ij gamma text const is this just some conversion tradition habit or does it carry any significance the absolute value changed sign and derivative
486914 suppose give you the following line element ds phidt phidx dy dz tag without saying anything you might think that this is just another line element like line element in spherical coordinates you might think that just perform another coordinate transformation to system who are endowned with particular chart in the manifold mg but if say to you that line element describes the newtonian gravity and moreover that the symbols phi are precisely the newtonian potential of gravity then you might ask why would give you the following explanation the motion of freely falling particle in curved spacetime is then given by the following calculation of the absolute or intrinsic derivative nabla partial gamma cb if you consider the line element of and non relativistic speeds then the equation of motion is reduced to spatial components nabla frac tau gamma which after calculations is reduced to frac dp tau delta ij partial phi partial phi now considering that we are in regime of low velocities then the newtonian equation is valid nabla phi then since is also valid by special relativity that frac dp tau then nabla phi frac dp tau partial phi implies that phi phi and the line element describes the newtonian gravity indeed now given reasonable explanation that phi phi you could sayalso that by equivalence principle also describes in local region relativistic form of gravity but here comes my doubt know that the geodesic deviation gives you the riemann tensor and for the metric you can conclude that the general quantity that encodes the notion of gravity as curvature is highly suggested by the ricci tensor because the following expression gives you way to talk about tidal effects mu frac delta mu tau mu nu gamma beta nu gamma delta beta implies 0j0 delta where mu frac delta mu tau is called acceleration between geodesics given by geodesic deviation and now the doubt why tidal effects are non local since we can describe tidal effects with the line element of by 0j0 delta frac partial partial phi

487240 recently heard about searl effect allegedly this generator produces free energy and that john searl was accused of stealing electricity but in fact he provided the entire laboratory with energy from generators working using the searl effect this is all very similar to deception but even though do not know electrodynamics well enough and do not know enough about magnetic phenomena not at that level to judge engine performance know how the energy conservation law works and that there is no free energy nevertheless many people are trying to recreate the engine of searl some argue that soviet engineers have recreated something similar have little faith in this so ask for help in this matter
487571 this is not duplicate the other answers do not specifically solve the contradiction nor do they give an exact answer have read this question are we so sure about superposition how do we know superposition exists will there be two cats in the box superposition if use virtual particles magnetic field to open the box in schrodingers experiment where st phane rollandin in comment says we never observe system in superposition what would two cats even look like superposition happens only when there is no observation if we can prove that superposition exists then why cant we measure it where cort ammon says superposition does not exist as much as it is mathematical tool that we use to describe the world that does exist we cant measure it because its not something to be measured superposition is concept in mathematics and where knzhou says we do measure superpositions all the time we can measure if light is diagonally polarized with polarizing filter but diagonal polarization is an equal superposition of horizontal and vertical polarization northeast is superposition of north and east but its also just an ordinary vector on its own similarly north is definite direction but its superposition of northeast and northwest totally analogously quantum measurements will give you definite results but the wavefunction after measurement is still superposition so this is contradiction one of them says we never observe superposition the other one says we do because even if the measurement gives us definite result it is still superposition of many states question which one is right can we do we or did we ever observe measure quantum system in superposition
487583 ive been surfing the web for quite while finding the answers would need but couldnt find convincing one first of all need to remind you that this very long continuous question so please kindly take your time ill provide some illustrations to make things easier and more pleasant to read assume that im pushing box against the table with force of mathrm in accordance to newtons 3rd law itll exert force equal but opposite to the box this is fairly simple to understand now heres the confusing part assume that somehow could exert the mathrm just to that single upper most molecule of the box neglect the possibilities that itll penetrate to the box or any such if that was the case how does the box actually exert force on the table or rather how does the force of my hand exert force on the table via the box here are my assumed possibilities possibility 1a in this case the force exerted on that molecule pushes the molecule below it and so on until the very last molecule of the box pushes the tables molecule and thus exerting force on it the diagram above gives pretty clear idea of my assumption but if this was the case then this would happen if im going to push that object on that particular point where that section of molecules of the box isnt directly in contact with the surface of the weighting scale then it wont read my pushing force which obviously doesnt make any sense and ive tried this experiment few days back and clearly the scale reads it possibility 1b my next assumption would be that the pushed molecules somehow push the molecules next to it and so with the other side and therefore the scale reads my push at first this seems pretty logical but after further thoughts then questioned my self if the molecules could affect other molecules dont they sum up in other words if that single molecule that was directly in contact with the source of the mathrm lets say my hypothetical microscopic finger could cause other molecules on that object to experience the same force this means that every molecule on that object experiences mathrm of downward pushing force and the weighting scale would read an astonishing force of mathrm times9 which is simply impossible as itll break the fundamental laws of physics possibility the assumptions below are based on my logic which frankly doubt which simply means force is divided equally amongst each individual molecules meaning that an object with less mass lets say molecules would experience more individual force then molecule object as the main force is divided less and thus higher acceleration now moving to the 2nd possibility which for me is slightly more sensible here assume that the force divides equally to each of the molecule so even if it was in the weighting scale scenario the sum exerted would always be equal to my push which is mathrm unfortunately this assumption has its weakness also and this doesnt go along with my intuition heres my explanation lets change the situation bit imagine that my goal is to penetrate through the first layer of the molecules using my hypothetical molecular nail exert force of mathrm to that box if my assumption holds true then the force would divide equally with the number of molecules in that object which is mathrm for each this is counter intuitive because the force needed to penetrate break that particular molecule varies as the number of molecules increase decrease if there were molecules then the force exerted on each molecule which includes the one would want to break to be mathrm which basically means the more the molecules in an object the more the force needed to break the bond of that particular molecule only not all of the bonds heres scenario visualized imagine driller drilling hole of mathrm cm in depth through the wall it doesnt matter how thick or wide the wall is the amount of force needed to drill mathrm cm hole stays the same or simply poking through piece of an a4 paper is just as easy as wider one a3 note that breaking in this case is not physically breaking the molecules into pieces but rather breaking its bonds jut wanted to make my explanation easy and concise to understand so prefer less intricate phrases main question made some assumptions already but each of them seems to be quite contradictive am missing something here or is there something new need to learn im currently sitting in highschool so there definitely is alot of things beyond my knowledge need to admit there are alot of my explanations that are doubtful even to me personally and ill not be surprised if there are few misconceptions here and there but ill be very glad to be corrected kindly take your time to answer any answer would be greatly appreciated
487692 consider relativity of simultaneity in sr where observers and are inertial with the lorentz transformation gammat vx we can see that the relativity of simultaneity comes from vx where indicates position of event say in frame its simple to deduce this fact because if we drop this term and suppose that two events are simultaneous in one frame one can see they will be simultaneous in all frames lets say there are two events in spacetime such that while neq by using the equation above and dropping vx gammat mbox and gammat mbox so now lets consider special case of acceleration where observer moves with constant proper acceleration and observer is inertial this is the so called hyperbolic motion and we have this transformation for time frac sinhgt as you can see does not depend on position of events so relativity of simultaneity can not be understood from this formula which is bit off considering is in motion relative to think this problem comes from my misunderestanding and this transformation does not apply for all events rather its merely for the events in origin probably however don koks in his book explorations in mathematical physics the concepts behind an elegant language compares relativity of simultaneity of events for accelerated frame where he uses the same transformation also appreciate if someone shows me way to compare simultaneity of events for accelerated frames with an example so in short whats the physical meaning of this transformation why is it not position dependent from physical point of view does it indicate some kind of absolute frame

488955 the book the ideas of particle physics contains brief treatment of quantum gravity in which the claim is asserted that if one attempts to construct model of gravity along the same lines as qed the result is non renormalizable and the reason why can be traced to the fact that in this case the force carrier the graviton is charged in the sense that it contains energy and therefore couples to energy which includes other gravitons this is in contrast to the photons in qed which are uncharged and therefore do not couple with each other is this assertion accurate or is it instead an oversimplification of something more complex
488978 when we have dc voltage source with switch in series with rl and the switch is closed at then it is said that current is zero initially but the voltage across inductor is same as that of applied voltage according to kirchhoff voltage law so there should be current according to ldi dt but it contradicts the initial statement so how do understand this if we have only inductor understand that current increases linearly with time but addition of resistor makes the current increase exponential how to understand this intuitively understand from the equations but not theoretically intuitively how it is happening understand that changing current causes the induced emf which opposes the changing current but what dont understand is wont it cause the current to be constant but here it seems to contradict that changing current should be there for emf to exist so how do we explain that voltage is reducing to zero and current is increasing with respect to the confusion mentioned above in inductor of rl circuit so basically am not understanding the behavior of induced emf in inductor please provide an intuitive explanation have gone through lot of questions on this site but couldnt find any answers regarding my confusion am stuck with this please help me with this
488993 in zinc copper daniell cell correct me if am wrong zinc has valence electrons so it wants to get rid of them to do so it sends them to the copper which needs to complete its valence shell there needs to be wire between the zinc and the copper for this reaction to happen so technically the plates are not charged its just the charges flowing out that create the electric field tldr are the plates of battery more like capacitor with excess charges on the plates or do they simply throw in and out electrons near their terminals and the individual plates of zinc and copper are neutral my confusion is this understand that the zinc wants to get rid of electrons and the copper wants more electrons but the zinc and copper atom are neutral its only the defecit of electrons on the conductor near the positive terminal and the excess of electrons near the negative terminal that for me would make an electric field or maybe its the wanting to get rid and the wanting to get more electrons that create an electric field if its indeed that please confirm thanks
489118 say that you have weight attached to metre long string and you are rotating the weight at is every point on the string going to be rotating at that same velocity of or is the velocity of the string going to change according to how far away you are from the centre of rotation im looking at the linear velocity
489126 it is chilly outside now and am kept warm by heat pump with cop eating only kw it steals kw from the outside air making it even colder and delivers the resulting kw into my house which makes me wonder why isnt it practicable to generate electricity by drawing thermal energy from the environment do the laws of physics prevent the heat that heat pumps deliver from being used for electricity generation by whatever means steam turbine
489214 lets imagine there are two isolated stationary worlds in space called and very far apart from each other live on world and some aliens live on world want to learn about the aliens on world by talking to them in person my lifespan is quadrillion years so im not worried about dying while traveling to them however would like to see the alien civilization as close to its infancy as possible in other words would rather see alien cavemen than alien astronauts if travel too slowly give their civilization too much time to develop into astronauts no good if travel fast enough close to the speed of light time passes faster for world than for me and my spaceship due to time dilation correct me if im wrong thus im worried that if travel too fast time might pass so quickly for world that they develop into astronauts before arrive am right to worry about this if so whats the optimal speed to ensure that arrive earliest in their civilizations development if my reasoning is wrong and traveling faster is always better then why
489461 when saw that thing did not understand how that shape is formed to be ideal take vertical smooth plane now aim at the wall with thin water tube then the outer layer forms parabolic shape with stagnation point as focus of it found it by tracing that shape how could you explain this observation also could you provide the equation in terms of velocity of flow angle of contact with the wall and gravitational constant
489587 this question could sound silly but though lot about it and im not new to physics lets say have plane on which use polar coordinates it means point can be indicated by its coordinates theta then we need basis in order to write the vectors as tuples of numbers the tangent basis for this coordinate system is frac partial partial frac partial partial theta what is derivative of know is point of the plane that is represented by its coordinates theta dont have mathematical form of with dependence on and theta that can differentiate
489689 consider having circuit which consists of battery and one resistor volts ohms so amperes and watts if we double the voltage and resistance the current will be the same and the power will be equal to watts hence the resistor will be hotter than the first case now here is the silly question the current in each of the two cases is constant and equals the current of the other the speed which charges move across the wire is constant so why is more heat generated while the speed of charges is constant know that the potential is doubled but the potential is potential and we cant make use of potential energy unless it is converted to kinetic energy how can the resistor make use of this potential energy the mechanism which the resistor turns potential energy into heat
490288 am not asking why an intrinsic property like spin can have more then single value understand particles electrons can come to existence with either up or down spin am asking why it can change while the particle exists electrons are defined in the sm as elementary particles and its intrinsic properties include both em charge and spin the electron is subatomic particle symbol or whose electric charge is negative one elementary charge quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum spin of half integer value expressed in units of the reduced planck constant the em charge of the electron is defined as 1e and the spin as electrons have an electric charge of coulombs which is used as standard unit of charge for subatomic particles and is also called the elementary charge the electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of this property is usually stated by referring to the electron as spin particle https en wikipedia org wiki electron in quantum mechanics and particle physics spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles composite particles hadrons and atomic nuclei although the direction of its spin can be changed an elementary particle cannot be made to spin faster or slower in addition to their other properties all quantum mechanical particles possess an intrinsic spin though this value may be equal to zero https en wikipedia org wiki spin physics he spin transition is an example of transition between two electronic states in molecular chemistry the ability of an electron to transit from stable to another stable or metastable electronic state in reversible and detectable fashion makes these molecular systems appealing in the field of molecular electronics https en wikipedia org wiki spin transition so basically an electron can change its spin from up to down or vica versa thought it is an intrinsic property electrons em charge cannot change in science and engineering an intrinsic property is property of specified subject that exists itself or within the subject so both em charge and spin are intrinsic properties of electrons though electrons are coming to existence with certain em charge and spin still em charge is unchanged as long as the electron exists but spin can change do understand that electrons can have intrinsic properties that can have either single value or set of values do understand that some elecrons come into existence with em charge and spin up some electrons come into existence with em charge and spin down what do not understand is how can spin change while the electron still exists whereas em charge cannot though both are intrinsic properties do we know that when an electron undergoes spin flip spin transition that the electron that had originally spin up is the same quantum system that after the spin transition has spin down can it be that the electron before with spin up ceases to exist vacuum fluctuation and then another electron is coming into existence with spin down why do we say that the electron that had spin up which is an intrinsic property is the same quantum system as the electron that has later on after spin flip spin down after the big bang at the baryion asymmetry some electrons came into existence with spin up and some with spin down do we call these the same electrons is spin the only intrinsic property of the electron that can change like helicity question how can an intrinsic property of an electron change spin flip are there any intrinsic properties of elementary particles that do have multiple values available but still cant change
490796 when the centripetal force on an orbiting body disappears if it the body is ball and the force was exerted by string and the string rips or more unrealistically if the body is the earth and the sun suddenly disappeared the body continues in linear motion how is angular momentum conserved here
490829 newtons shell theorem has two corollaries the gravitational attraction of spherically symmetric body acts as if all its mass were concentrated at the center and the gravitational acceleration inside the cavity of spherically symmetric body vanishes consider spaceship floating freely in space in homogeneous universe the combined attraction from all matter should cancel out and the spaceship should stay motionless nevertheless im free to divide the attraction into several parts originating from different parts of the universe in the figure below ive divided the universe into red sphere centered on some arbitrary point with my spaceship located at the edge of the sphere plus infinitely many shells centered on the same point by corollary the gravitational attraction of the red sphere equals that of all its mass centered at the point by corollary the combined acceleration of the spaceship from all mass in the green shell vanishes the same can be said for the blue shell the orange shell and so on ad infinitum hence my spaceship should start accelerating toward by choosing the sphere large enough should be able to make it accelerate arbitrarily fast and by choosing the location of can make it accelerate in any direction of course this doesnt work but why my best guess is that even in an infinite universe you cant keep adding spheres because youll exit the observable universe in which case theres no way to feel the gravity in part of the shell so that its no longer symmetric perhaps also the expansion of the universe matters but see the last two points below few more things to consider the mass of the red sphere increases with the chosen radius as while the acceleration it generates is proportional to hence the acceleration increases linearly with the chosen our universe the universe has an average density of some mathrm mathrm cm hence if set equal to the radius of the observable universe billion light years the acceleration is minuscule mathrm cm mathrm if that bothers you choose another universe where rho is ten orders of magnitude higher our universe is not really homogeneous but on large enough scales gtrsim half billion light years it seems it is still the acceleration of the spaceship will be dominated by nearby sources if that bothers you choose sufficiently homogeneous universe on the scales were considering the universe is not governed by newtonian dynamics but by general relativity if that bothers you use birkhoffs theorem instead think the issue is the same if the issue is really that the size of the observable universe matters then my intuition tells me that can just choose an arbitrarily old universe where the asymmetric contribution from the most distant shells is arbitrarily small if the issue is that the universe expands so that gravity from the far side of shell is somehow weakened or redshifted then my intuition tells me that can just choose sufficiently static universe
491058 when forget to water my plants and their soil becomes very dry during the next watering can see that the soil becomes hydrophobic can even see pockets of air between the repelled blob of water and the soil on the contrary when the soil is moist it very quickly absorbs the water this goes against the intuition that the diffusion in order to equalize the concentration soil water would create the opposite effect what is the physical explanation of this phenomenon tried to search on google but the explanations are of low quality and very high level without real physics involved
492073 say we have charges set up like above why is can understand mathematically that the scalars fields cancel out but dont understand it physically if place positive charge in between the charges it has electric potential energy because it is feels force towards the negative charge and repelled by the positive and gains kinetic energy however because the electric potential is thus the electrical potential energy is how can 0v if charge placed in between the two charges will gain kinetic energy
492112 the electric field bf represents how much force would act on particle at certain position per unit charge however if we actually place particle in that position the electric field will have singularity there because of the frac in coulombs law isnt this kind of paradox in my eyes this makes the concept of electric field useless because it cannot be used to calculate the force on particle
492353 everyone is familiar with the whirring sound of jet engines when seeing an aircraft taking off from nearby airport it is distinctly very loud on the ground and one can hear it even when the airplane is miles away although one can hear white noise like sound when inside an airplane the engines dont sound very loud in spite of being just meters away from them understand that the cabin is well insulated from the outside but would expect to hear similar whirring sound of the engines so what is the phenomenon that makes jet engines sound louder on earth compared to inside the aircraft cabin
492591 im learning about centripetal force and was shown scenario where man was spinning rope attached to ball over his head theres centripetal acceleration toward the center and therefore force must be acting in the same direction as the centripetal acceleration the centripetal force but wonder if thats considered tension force as well is it
492797 think that uniform velocity implies constant speed but not constant direction while constant velocity implies constant speed without any changes in direction both tell us that theres no acceleration since magnitude of velocity is constant the same goes for acceleration both imply constant magnitude but only constant acceleration means that theres no change in its direction however lot of people on the internet argue that whether its the other way around or that theres no difference at all whos right and whos wrong
492887 have regularly heard that the michelson morley experiment demonstrates that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames by doing some research have found that it actually demonstrated that the luminiferous aether probably didnt exist and that the speed of light didnt vary depending on which direction the planet was travelling in dont see how it demonstrated that motion towards light source for instance doesnt affect the observers speed relative to the light as there were no moving parts in the experiment the other sources ive looked at which say that the michelson morley experiment proved nothing like this one is the second postulate of einsteins special relativity an axiom and this one how can we show that the speed of light is really constant in all reference frames tend to say that maxwells equations were actually more significant to einstein as they predict that light moves at constant velocity and this velocity has to be relative to something or in relativitys case everything that something was thought to be the aether but in the absence of that why could it not be relative to whatever emitted it it seems like more obvious immediate conclusion to come to than the idea that its the same relative to everyone and all the counterintuitive results that ensue another idea is that the speed of light is the universal speed limit and therefore must have fixed value just to work under galilean relativity but then that argument goes in circles why cant you go faster than the speed of light because otherwise your mass becomes infinite why does your mass become infinite because of einsteins special relativity but this is based on the original fact that you cant go faster than the speed of light so theres no argument can find which completely answers why the speed of light has to be constant other than that it has been regularly tested since so my questions are is there something im missing about the michelson morley experiment or maxwells equations which explains my objections and definitively shows that the speed of light is constant and it is impossible to go faster than it if not is there any other specific example ideally which would have been there for einstein which can use to explain to people with no knowledge of relativity why it is the case
492965 in physics we want irreducible representations of the symmetry group of our system however one frequently sees representations of the corresponding lie algebra being studied instead is it that in the specific groups that pop up in physics for some reason there is bijection between irreps of the group and irreps of its lie algebra know that one can get representations of the lie algebra by differentiating the representations of the lie group but also know that not all representations of the lie algebra can be obtained in this way guess is it because we dont really want representations but instead we want projective representations and these are in bijective relation with the representations of the lie algebra or some extension find the literature on this pretty unclear
493698 background for few years now there is significant difference in the calculation of the cosmological constant between standard candles methods and cmb methods cmb measurement comes from very young universe 400k years and the resulting cosmological constant as calculated by the planck collaboration is smaller than what is observed today question is this so called tension the main reason for talking about accelerated expansion ive found relevant article by hossenfelder understand that according to the article the answer to this question is yes but weve also seen some other minor indications in support of accelerated expansion note the question is not about whether any of the measurements are plagued by uncertainties or how trustworthy they are in general
494096 suppose the question is somewhat like this if 4t and the position at time rm is rm find the distance traveled displacement and final position at rm since text dx text dt 4t then text dx 4t text dt after integrating we find xt 8t 2t and substituting the value of rm we get x3 rm is the answer that found displacement position or distance it cant be distance am sure of this but is it position or displacement
494286 know that this question has been asked here before but am little bit confused with all the answers so when we move we apply force on the ground in the backward direction so is the ground applying force on us in the forward direction by virtue of friction or by virtue of normal reaction some answers seem to suggest that it is the former while some say that friction is the reaction force used to think that normal reaction is the force that only exists so that solid objects dont pass through each other
494639 to find out the stationary states of hamiltonian we will be finding the eigenvalues and eigenstates is there any condition that form of the hamiltonian should be like hat hat hat hat hat mean the sum of kinetic operator and potential operator term can have hamiltonian without kinetic term hat hat or in other words can have hamiltonian with just potential term alone hat hat hat does quantum mechanics allow that

494955 bucket is rotating in uniform circular motion when the bucket is at the topmost point in the loop the water does not fall at this point both the tension and gravitational force is acting on the water then it should be pulled with an even greater force then why does the water not fall the same question can be asked about motorcyclist performing loop de loop why does he not fall on the topmost point when both gravity and normal reaction are acting downwards
495163 in problem which was doing came across an expression for the potential of system as follows left frac frac right tag label where is constant and are distances and gg now went to find an approximate expression left frac right and reasoning that since gg approx and thus approx frac 2k tag label but this turns out to be wrong as the potential is expected to for an harmonic oscillator and thus propotional to the right way to approximate is begin align frac left frac frac right approx frac left left1 frac frac right left1 frac frac right right approx frac left2 frac 2x right end align ignoring the constant as im concerned about the differences in the potential get approx frac 2kx label tag which is correct what mistake did do in my approximation method
495219 ive read about the concept of laser induced plasma channel where air can be ionized to form plasma using laser light can this be done or is it hypothetically possible to ionize air with microwave radiation know that microwaves dont have enough energy in electron volts to cause air to become ionized but what if the microwaves are generated with high voltage can these microwaves have enough energy to cause ionization

495732 my parents bought this air conditioner but am very skeptical that this can cool room or even cool anything doubt that it even has cooling element suspect that it is just fan humidifier but even if this device had cooling element it still couldnt cool room if air is cooled the resulting heat cant just vanish it has to go somewhere because of the 1st law of thermodynamics energy conservation in normal full sized air conditioner the air is cooled and the resulting hot air is blown outside but in this mini air conditioner the heat cant go outside it can only stay in the room keeping the room at the same temperature am missing something or is this scam as suspected in response to comment im interested in using this cooler in germany where the relative humidity is typically

496290 in mer determined that the speed of light must be finite his experiment consisted on observing the eclipses of io one of jupiters moons by jupiter itself he timed these eclipses over period of half year starting when the earth was closest up to when the earth was farthest from jupiter since the orbital period of jupiter is years and that of io is days the motion of jupiter can be ignored in the argument at the end of this month period mer found that the eclipses were delayed by minutes from what would have been if io orbited jupiter at constant rate mer interpreted this as the time taken by the light from io to travel the distance that the earth had moved away from it over the half year what dont understand from these results is the figure of minutes the distance the earth should have moved is twice the distance from it to the sun and the time light would take to travel this distance is around minutes not cannot think of physical explanation for such large delay because the difference between earths perihelion and aphelion is only it is very small compared to the difference in times if we do consider the motion of jupiter we find that it actually gets closer to earth because it orbits in the same direction the orbit of jupiter is inclined earths this means that the distance should be little smaller than the light minutes rather than larger so my question is why did mer find the figure of minutes am overlooking some part of the mechanics or is it that his lab equipment was very imprecise because it was almost years ago if it is the latter could then repeat the experiment with modern equipment and find reasonable figure for the speed of light has anyone done this
496531 are the electronic orbitals of an atom always quantified in the same way the same energy required to reach the next level or does each atom have its own values for each level if the quantification is universal then the creation of photons due to the deexcitation of the electrons at the wavelength color corresponding to the transition should be more abundant in the universe than all the other frequency except one detects no more photon of given wavelength than of another so where is my reasoning error
496678 if understand correctly there is small probability the same electron to be found anywhere in the universe suppose that an anti electron collides with an electron annihilating it and producing two photons assuming the speed of light limit is correct right after the collision the probability that the electron is found at distance of from the collision must still be non zero for time of at least but wouldnt this mean that its still possible for the annihilated electron to still be present somewhere else and collide with another anti electron meaning that the same electron was annihilated twice
496751 there are two objects of the same material similar geometry but different dimensions and same temperature the larger object is supposed to contain more quantity of heat because it has larger volume now know that the quantity of emitted thermal radiation is directly proportional to temperature but is it also regarding to internal energy how do know which object emits more thermal radiaion without measurement
496929 my book states that average speed of moving body can never be except when time approaches infinity understand that average speed total dist total time and that if time is infinity average speed will be anything divided by infinity gives but would like to creatively and intuitively understand what does infinity mean
497087 obviously some things such as the speed of light in vacuum are defined to be precise value the kilogram was recently defined to have specific value by fixing planks constant to cdot frac kg in particular in the case of the latter we held off on defining this value until the two competing approaches for measuring the kilogram agreed with each other within the error bounds of their respective measurements which leads me to wonder what is the most precisely measured not defined value that the scientific community has measured am thinking in terms of relative error uncertainty value before we defined it planks constant was measured to relative error of have we measured anything with lower relative error
497325 supposing an ideal wire how do electrons accelerate and gain kinetic energy what understand when circuit is opened electrons are crowded at the negative term of the battery and have high electric potential energy when we close the circuit electrons start accelerating and gaining kinetic energy through the wire what confuses me first there isnt an electric field through the wire an ideal wire sigma so cant say that electrons gain kinetic energy and accelerate due to the electric field second if electrons lose electric potential energy converted to kinetic energy then there must be an electric field because of the definition of voltage electromotive force is quantitative expression of the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field what did miss
497374 when we measure position for example how does the system know that were measuring position in order to collapse to position eigenvector does the wave function always evolve from the state that it collapsed to for example if we measure the position whatever that means does the wave evolve from delta function
497560 this question has been puzzling me lately im sure youve seen demonstrations of metal containers imploding when evacuated here for example are two videos of vacuum collapse experiment experiment however when the same experiment is conducted with material as fragile as glass nothing implodes or shatters two videos of the same experiment conducted with glass experiment experiment nothing is special about the quality of the glass used in experiments and the glass is also not very thick yet evacuating the glass almost to vacuum doesnt so much as put scratch on it but the metal containers implode with great force what is the reason for this difference my guesses are the total surface area of the glass used in experiments and are much smaller compared to the surface area of the metal in experiments and greater surface area equates to greater force absorbed by the entire structure even though the force per unit area remains the same ductile deformation metal is fundamentally different from brittle fracture glass involving different mechanisms of atomic displacement blaise pascal famously conducted several experiments with vacuum in glass test tube in the 17th century please share your thoughts on this thank you edit dont mean to say that glass never implodes shatters in such experiments obviously
497904 am learning the basics of thermodynamics everywhere read about the first law it states conservation of energy and talks about how change in internal energy equals heat and work transfer am aware of work transfer being considered positive and negative depending on the point of view we want to set that is okay but it confuses me to see the word conservation if we take very simple or at least very common real process like putting plastic bottle completely filled with liquid water into freezer or whatever environment that is constantly under and wait for thermal equilibrium to happen the bottle will have expanded because water will have frozen increasing its volume and pushing the bottles limits in this case the system the bottle has lost or given away whatever amount of heat and it will also have generated work transfer to make the bottle expand it doesnt matter if we consider that work positive once or negative twice in both cases energy has left the system in the form of work the total amount of internal energy of the system has clearly decreased so apparently there isnt really any conservation happening do not intend to hate on thermodynamics its actually beautiful just want to understand the semantics read other similar questions like this one but in none did find clear answer
498124 emphasis is on the irreducible get whats special about them but is there some principle that im missing that says it can only be irreducible representations or is it just more beautiful and usually the first thing people tried whenever im reading about some gut su5 so10 you name it people usually consider some irreducible rep as candidate field also the sm lagrangian is constructed in this way here experimental evidence of course suggests it
498395 so was thinking about air conditioner today and how we run air across compressed freon to cool down air but why do we need freon at all why not store just compressed air my guess is because its inefficient my question given cubic meter tank of air if the room temperature at atmosphere is degrees at what atmosphere would you have to have the tank so that the initial release of the air would be the temperature degrees
498528 most earthquakes with magnitude and higher can damage or destroy buildings however according to my knowledge and experience have never seen someone dying from an earthquake itself rather they die from an associated tsunami damaged buildings etc this seems counter intuitive since you need much more force to destroy building or damage it than to break the human femur or cause similar damage to other species
498556 this was question published by cambridge international for an as level question last year for ii the mark scheme says that lambda thus giving double the wavelength as supposed the one shown on the graph if you try visualizing it you would see that that the graph for not against would have wave with lower amplitude intuitively you would also modify lambda to half the length so that it looks to scale but this is odd when we know the fact that is independent of both and lambda in this case shouldnt the detector simply square the amplitude without altering any values on mathrm cm what am missing here
498588 when an object is experiencing free fall it has constant acceleration and hence an increasing velocity neglecting friction thus its momentum is increasing but according to law of conservation of momentum shouldnt there be corresponding decrease in momentum somewhere else where is it

499186 nature mostly prefers simultaneous events acceleration is produced without any delay on applying force angular acceleration is produced without any delay on applying torque bulb glows simultaneously as we close the circuit heat is transferred from one place to another as we allow it without any delay dont think there are any such events except transmission of waves which takes time in physics why is this so edit really appreciate the answer given by aaron stevens but there is something still unclear to me calculus as well as newtonian mechanics start with approximations but those approximations are really beneficial to us as they simply the complex mathematical equations involved in several problems as aaron stevens wrote in his answer that on microscopic scale there is delay between force and acceleration think that in our standard model we take no delay of time which is still an approximation we give answers to the problems based on our standard models which are based on numerous no of approximations and assumptions similarly in the next example he said that there is nothing rigid on microscopic scale again say that we assume that every thing is rigid it is my gentle request that please give answers based on the assumptions we made while building our standard model
499520 ive always thought that there is nothing in the universe that cannot be compressed or deformed under enough force but my friend insists that elementary particles are exempt from this my thought is that if two such objects collided since there is no compression there is no distance across which the collision occurs which means that it would be instantaneous the impulse in collision is equal to the force divided by time so as time approaches zero then the momentary force would approach infinity and it seems absurd to be able to produce infinite force from finite energy
500218 so this question from phd qualifying examination given the following lagrangan frac dot text sin 2q what is the hamiltonian for this system so finding the canonical momentum and then using dot find that it is identically zero now the answer zero was choice in the choices of answers given but the correct answer is that the hamiltonian is undefined im not sure why this should be the answer though this is pretty weird dynamical system the euler lagrange equations just give an identity and the hamiltonian equations also seem rather off the hamiltonian equations would are dot dot im hoping someone shed some light on this it seems that any random lagrangian doesnt constitute dynamical system so what should be looking for
500382 in many quantum mechanics textbooks and solid state texts the authors usually use the standard form of the scattered wavefunction psi ir theta phi frac ik where psi is the incoming wavefunction and theta phi some function of the detection angles my question is how do justify the choice of frac ikr as the dependence part of the scattered wave the only justification that have encountered so far is that in the far field limit the scattered wave should be an outward propagating wave what puzzles me is why wouldnt write down something like frac ikr or some superpositions of these functions frac ikr frac ikr frac ikr etc
500505 recently learned about an example where an operator not hermitian acted on wavefunction psi rangle and carried the wavefunction out of hilbert space psi rangle is not in hilbert space can hermitian operator carry wavefunction out of hibert space up till now always did calculations in qm assuming that psi rangle is still in hilbert space
500562 ive always thought that it was because the frictional force on the tire was increased due to the bulging of the tires increasing the surface area in contact with the road however colleague of mine reminded me that frictional force is independent of surface area why then is fuel economy decreased when tire pressure is low
500652 so this goes to something so fundamental can barely express it the schr dingers cat thought experiment ultimately asserts that until the box is opened the cat is both dead and alive now this is obviously ludicrous the cat either died or lived at some point someone opening the box and observing it had zero influence on it saying the cat was both alive and dead till the box was opened seems to be some kind of hardware defect in some peoples thinking mean with all respect dont know how can be polite about it we humans arent that important things happen whether we see them or not mean do really even need to state that the question then is schr dingers cat meant to be taken at all physically
500693 what is the difference between translation and galilean transformation
500833 ive often wondered if gas cylinder is connected to hob say or boiler or whatever and someone turns the knob to allow gas to flow why is that when flame is held to light the gas it isnt possible for the newly lit gas ignited gas to travel back through the pipe to the source hence igniting the gas in the cylinder is it because the gas is held at pressure so that the gas escapes the pipes with pressure and somehow burns outward rather than returning down the pipe
500901 instantaneous velocity is defined as the limit of average velocity as the time interval becomes infinitesimally small average velocity is defined as the change in position divided by the time interval during which the displacement occurs when the time interval is infinitesimally small there shouldnt be any considerable change in position thus the instantaneous velocity should be
502606 im studying qm from shankar he introduces linear operators and says that an operator is an instruction for transforming one ket into another but then few lines below he says operators can also act on bras so does the complete specification of an operator include its action on bras or does its action on the kets determine its action on the bras

502829 stumbled across this page describing the energy of given object in orbit it describes total energy as mathrm total where frac mv and frac gmm towards the bottom of the page it states that if total orbital energy exceeds zero the orbit becomes hyperbolic is there any empirical reasoning as to why this is true
503017 since sound travels as longitudinal waves sound waves should only be able to propagate in medium through compressions and rarefactions however water as liquid is generally treated as an incompressible fluid since compression is essential to sound propagation how do phenomena such as whale calls and underwater speakers work
503023 what ive heard from books and other materials is that heat is nothing but the sum of the movement of molecules so as you all know one common myth breaker was unlike in movies you dont get frozen right away when you get thrown into space but the thing that bugs me is that things in the universe eventually cool down how is that possible when there are no other things around to which the molecules can transfer their heat
503161 was going through griffiths electrodynamics and came upon an example where he used that cos theta hat sin theta hat theta hat now admit was confused for while with this but got the relationship on writing out the spherical unit vectors in the terms of cartesian coordinates which is hat sin theta cos phi mathbf hat sin theta sin phi mathbf hat cos theta mathbf hat hat theta cos theta cos phi mathbf hat cos theta sin phi mathbf hat sin theta mathbf hat all that done we one can verify the results easily now my actual question is how to determine this intuitively like when we use the area element we can use our physical reasoning to find it by taking infinitesimal displacements in the theta text and phi direction the volume element in similar way know this may be suited for math stackexchange but since physicists are expert at shorthands like these hence my question here
503488 when an object moves in circle theres an acceleration towards the center of the circle the centripetal acceleration which also gives us the centrifugal force since ma is the equation for force and the acceleration of an object therefore is caused by force but according to newtons third law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction which would mean that because of the centripetal force theres an equal force outwards which would say is the centrifugal force but this is obviously not true since that would mean that the net acceleration on the object moving in the circle would be so my question is what is actually this reaction force thats created by the centripetal force and where does the centrifugal force come from do know that the centrifugal force can be viewed as an inertial force in certian reference frame but is there any way to describe it in another way can imagine that the centripetal force may come from friction with the road if youre in car and if the reaction force is the force into the ground it makes sense except for the centrifugal force
504183 we observe that protons are positively charged and that neutrons are strongly attracted to them much as we would expect of oppositely charged particles we then describe that attraction as non electromagnetic strong force attraction why posit an ersatz force as responsible rather than describing neutrons as negatively charged based on their behavior keep running up against circular and tautological reasoning from the laity in explanation of this we know they arent charged because we attribute their attraction to different force and we ascribe this behavior to different force because we know they arent charged im looking for an empirically based vs purely theoretical mathematical explanation can someone help
504476 is the spacetime the same thing as the mathematical 4th dimension we often say that time is the fourth dimension but am wondering if its means that time is like the fourth geometrical axis or its something different than geometrical axis and something thats used to represent it graphically even though time has no geometrical feature if they differ can you tell me in what way it differs so that layman can understand
504493 have radioactive particle in box prepared so as to initially be in pure state psi theta theta is undecayed is decayed put geiger counter in the box over time the theory says that the state should evolve into pure state that is superposition of undecayed and decayed with the decayed part getting bigger and bigger psi theta theta eventually the counter will click indicating that the particle has decayed now know that the state is decayed however before this happened the silence of the counter also indicated that the particle hadnt decayed yet so all the time up to that point also knew that the state was undecayed but this would be contradicting what the theory suggests superposition with non zero contribution of the decayed state after some time so im guessing its an incorrect way of analysing the experiment want to know where the mistake lies in other words it seems to me the geiger counter is always measuring the state of the particle silence means undecayed click means decayed so the particle would never actually decay since continuously know its state is psi theta theta which means its chance of decaying would be perpetually zero zenos effect ive heard how do deal with this constant passive measuring
505045 this article claims that nucleons in dense nucleus exceed percent of the speed of light how do you measure or infer the speed of nucleons in the nucleus note added later im looking here for experimental techniques that are as direct as possible using the uncertainty principle is of course valid but its not really what im looking for here for two reasons it provides rough estimate only arguably it feels to me more like theoretical prediction as opposed to measurement
505593 when electrons transition from higher energy state to lower energy state energy difference they produce massless photon with frequency nu where delta nu is planck constant we know energy mas relation mc why not create some kind particle in this case particle that has mass that we could calculate from the energy difference of the two states of the electron is there any kind critical energy difference delta such that lower than delta always is creating photon and higher than delta its value create particle with mass
505678 ive been trying to understand the conceptual idea and purpose of enthalpy for the past two days from what ive learned enthalpy is defined as pv this leads me to my first question was this formula created or was it derived for example the formula for kinetic energy can be derived from the equation for work dx so for enthalpy is this formula derived from something else or is it just brand new idea that was simply created by someone as pv because its easier to solve this than find the internal energy for some processes like in an open lab where pv work is hard to measure next the change in enthalpy is expanded as pv pv pv from what read unlike internal energy enthalpy becomes very useful when the pressure is constant the explanations all say that this is because when pressure is constant the and pv terms become equal to each other and cancel out leaving only heat this makes me ask why does pressure need to be constant if pressure is non constant couldnt they still cancel out just as random example if 2x then wouldnt it be 2x 2x thus cancelling out secondly why do we even need to measure enthalpy if enthalpy is simply the heat transferred when pressure is constant were obviously simply ignoring the pv work done so why introduce new idea at all instead of just continuing to use internal energy and heat many websites say things along the lines of sometimes its hard to measure changes in internal energy because its hard to measure the pv work done in lab setting since beakers and test tubes are open so we introduce enthalpy which accounts for the work and is simply heat transfer when pressure is constant isnt the above statement just the same as saying its hard to measure work so lets ignore work and measure heat instead if so then what benefit does measuring enthalpy give us when we could just always measure heat transfer regardless of whether pressure is constant or not please let me know if should elaborate on my question if something is unclear at this point im so confused that im not even sure how to word my questions well spent the past days trying to figure it out but ended up getting even more confused and frustrated
505756 have been launching water bottle rockets with my kids and we are in the process of creating simulation of the launch using numerical methods am mechanical engineer but fluid dynamics is not my strong suit can you give me an intuitive explanation why the two methods below give factor of difference for thrust which method is correct first method found these formulas for calculating thrust at the following website https www ohio edu mechanical programming rocket analysis1 html thrust equals mass flow rate times the exhaust velocity dot mass flow rate is found using the water density nozzle area and exhaust velocity dot rho combining we get rho the square of the exhaust velocity is equal to times the internal gauge pressure divided by the water density 2p rho combining we see that the thrust is equal to times the nozzle area times the pressure 2ap second method in the image below it seems that the thrust on the rocket should be equal to the force imbalance as shown by the arrows this force imbalance is the internal gage pressure times the nozzle area ap update based on all the great answers and comments think the following figure is better representation of the thrust force internal pressure red arrows drops off near the nozzle opening because the water flow speed is significant also the water at the nozzle opening is not at zero pressure as had originally assumed instead there is dynamic pressure green arrows that is inversely proportional to the flow velocity the force imbalance equals double the air pressure times the nozzle area 2ap
505988 noticed that the meter sprints are conducted on curved tracks see this video world championship semifinals isnt that weird mean just look at the curvatures of each lane source since they use staggered start lines the total track length is the same but the person on the innermost lane would have to do more work as compared to the one on the outermost lane he would have to put in an additional amount of work against friction to counter the extra centrifugal force the extra centrifugal force is roughly newtons from my calculation believe that the winners of running race are the ones who do more work against the friction so dont you think the runners in the inner lanes should be given an advantage
506254 is there some method for solving differential equations that can be applied to maxwell equations to always get solution for the electromagnetic field even if numerical regardless of the specifics of the problem lets say you want to design series of steps that you can handle to student and he will be able to obtain and for any problem the instructions dont have to be simple or understandable to someone without proper background but is it possible

506716 as far as know number of protons is less that or equal to the number of neutrons in any atomic nucleus but is there any possibility that there exists nucleus where the number of protons exceeds number of neutrons apart of course from the trivial case of hydrogen actually wanted this to be discussion involving binding energy its my mistake did not correctly write my query as many of you have pointed out protium has in fact more protons than neutrons but in protium there is only proton so there is no involvement of binding energy for an atomic nucleus to be stable the repulsive force between protons must be less than the binding energy but is there any atomic nuclei which is stable whose ratio is less than
506759 was reading an article by the smithsonian institute about the rising sea levels in it they mention how warmer water expands more thus it helps to raise the average sea level this makes perfect sense to me as ive always known that heat generally causes substance to expand but am very skeptical as to how much of difference this makes which is my question how much expansion is caused by the rise in average global temperatures now dont think the rise in average surface temperatures results in an equal raise in ocean temperatures because most of the ocean below meters or so hovers close to freezing year round so dont think the whole of the ocean temperature rises in lock step with the heating of the earths surface specifically would like someone to calculate how much sea level rises due to or degree warmer average temperature overall as secondary question would like to know how much surface temperatures affect ocean temperatures
506845 so lately heard of this theory that planet might be primordial black hole pbh with times the mass of earth was thinking to myself what would happen if such pbh if it even exists were to fall into our sun would it slowly consume the sun even tough its mass is just fraction of the star would the sun eventually become black hole itself ps sorry for any typos or any wrong wording not native english speaker pps not physicist or anything just interested in the universe and how it works
507001 have question pertaining to the concept of acceleration and its formula both seem to give me different answers was asked train is moving at velocity of mathrm it hits the breaks and starts slowing down at the rate of mathrm how long does it travel before coming to stop mathrm mathrm displacement is asked according to the formula of frac 2a answer got was meters but my concept of acceleration explains me this according to my intuition of acceleration and velocity when an object is said to be accelerating at mathrm it means that with every passing second its velocity will reduce mathrm so at 1st second velocity mathrm itll travel meters at 2nd second mathrm mathrm mathrm train travels meters at 3rd it travels meters at 4th it halts so total is meters it travels meters before halt where am going wrong in my conceptual understanding really dont understand
507192 as light is electromagnetic radiation then why dont see any magnet bending light wave or why light doesnt diffract whenever it passes by live wire
507372 this question is inspired by sign saw at lift which said something like going up floor or down floors take the stairs its better for your health and for the environment theres no doubt that taking the stairs is better for ones health but the physicist in me wonders about the latter an analysis presumably whoever wrote that sign was thinking about energy usage by taking the stairs instead of the lift save on the electricity required to power the lift however gravity is conservative field the end result in both cases is that move up one floor so the amount of work energy required to get me up one floor is independent of the path take it should only depend on the initial and final states therefore the electricity saved is compensated for by the fact that need to eat more food so my muscles can produce the energy required to move me up one floor if take the stairs do more than mgh of work because the stairs isnt completely vertical and theres some amount of horizontal work done therefore its actually more energy intensive overall to take the stairs instead of the lift there is also some kinetic energy have to impart to my body to make it move upwards but my body also has kinetic energy in the lift and we assume they are equal however seems superficial because the final state isnt exactly the same the lift has also moved up one floor the mass of the lift is obviously quite large so to get it up one floor takes more energy but its exactly because of this that modern lifts use counterweight that serves as gravity battery whenever the electric motor moves the lift down some amount of weight is lifted as counterbalance when the lift moves up most of the energy comes from the potential energy stored in the gravity battery the electric motor doesnt actually do much work besides even if the electric motor does more work the argument only holds in one direction if it takes more energy to go up the building compared to walking it takes less energy to go down the building compared to walking if we assume that on average move both up and down the building then this difference cancels out and were left with the argument in conclusion the sign is wrong its slightly worse for the environment to take the stairs instead of the lift im wondering if this analysis is good or if missed something
507374 was learning about black body radiation and the explanations given by max planck and albert einstein when thought crossed my mind when we heat an iron piece its color changes gradually from red orange yellow to bluish white yet such change is not visible in glowing piece of charcoal obtained from wood why is it that wood charcoal is not able to glow in colors of higher frequencies
507626 ill be honest only have highschool education so there might be something obvious im overlooking however particle physics is of massive interest to me my question is know there are unstable quark antiquark pairs that form mesons but are there any baryons that are not wholly made up of quarks or antiquarks up up anti down if the answer is no why not
507944 while deriving the wave function why dont we take into the account of the probability density of the nucleus my intuition says that the nucleus is also composed of subatomic particles so it will also have probability cloud like electrons have do we not do it for simplicity of the calculation or is the nucleus fixed or any other property of the nucleus
508066 lets say that we have tennis balls in space one being in motion say pushed by an astronaut and the other one still if we could take snapshot of both tennis balls would there be any evidence that could suggest that one is moving and the other one is still is there anything happening at the atomic level or bigger being responsible for the motion if there isnt and both balls are absolutely identical then how come one is still and the other one moving where does the difference of motion come from

508613 do the brakes have to do more work ignoring air resistance slowing vehicle from mathrm to mathrm than from mathrm to mathrm say mathrm kg vehicle is moving at mathrm it has kinetic energy of frac12 times1000 mathrm kg times10 mathrm mathrm then the brakes are applied and it slows to mathrm so now has kinetic energy of frac12 times1000 mathrm kg times8 mathrm mathrm the brakes are now applied again and it slows to mathrm now the kinetic energy is frac12 times1000 mathrm kg times6 mathrm mathrm so in the first braking instance mathrm mathrm mathrm of kinetic energy were converted into heat by the brakes in the second braking instance mathrm mathrm mathrm of kinetic energy was converted into heat by the brakes doesnt seem intuitively right to me would imagine the work required from brakes would be equal to the amount velocity was reduced regardless of the start velocity
508909 just read text about astronomy and when talking about dark matter the author says the dark matter responsible for the orbits of the stars in the milky way is probably different from the dark matter responsible for the orbit of the milky way within the local super cluster of galaxies is this true how would it be different and why for context this is the whole paragraph since the 1930s astronomers have measured the orbits of galaxies in clusters of galaxies clusters of galaxies in clusters of clusters and so forth they have found similar anomalies in the angular velocity of galaxies at these larger scales again the anomalous high angular velocities of the galaxies and clusters of galaxies may be explained by postulating mysterious dark matter that fills the universe it is doubtful that one can explain the anomalous angular velocities at different scales by the same type of dark matter thus the dark matter responsible for the orbits of the stars in the milky way is probably different from the dark matter responsible for the orbit of the milky way within the local super cluster of galaxies and the article can be found here https mathblog com wp content uploads keplers new astronomy pdf
509242 do lot of fibrework carding wool spinning yarn weaving etc and ive noticed funny behaviour that anything long and flexible which can withstand significant torque exhibits if take piece of yarn and begin to twist it it remains twisted so long as keep it in tension the piece is held straight however as soon as remove that tension by bringing both ends closer to each other it will begin to wind back on itself in the same direction as the yarn was twisted want to know what physically is going on that causes this is anyone able to draw chart showing where certain forces are pushing pulling update penguinos answer helps me to understand that the rotation of the thread is in the same direction when the ends are brought together however still dont understand why the individual ends untwisting would cause the ends to rotate around each other
509402 to put it simply we group our em waves into groups such as rays microwaves visible light etc was wondering if the properties of say rays slowly change into the properties of say gamma rays or as soon as the wavelength is larger than picometers its properties become that of an ray if its the former how do we calulate the standards for identifying wave
509431 an oft cited problem with the planetary model of hydrogen is that if the electron were in fact classically orbiting the proton then it would radiate away all of its energy and fall into the nucleus the quantum mechanical approach fixes this by saying that there exist states for the electron orbiting the proton whose probability density has no time dependence no time dependence means that there is no oscillating field which means that no energy is radiated away my question is why do the electrons tend to be in energy eigenstates in principle bound electron could be in state psi rangle given by psi rangle sum infty nlms nlms rangle where the nlms rangle are the energy eigenstates of the electron in these states the probability density would have nontrivial time dependence which would lead to radiation it seems to me that if there is no reason for an electron to be in an energy eigenstate then the quantum mechanical model has the same problem as the planetary model how does the quantum mechanical model assure us that the electron eventually falls into particular energy eigenstate and why does the electron stay there
509467 without invoking hermitian conjugation which to my mind at least would beg the question what is it that makes the bra langle psi rvert the unique dual of the ket rvert psi rangle for instance know that provided rvert psi rangle is not null then langle psi rvert maps rvert psi rangle to the positive reals however there can exist some langle phi rvert neq langle psi rvert which also happens to map rvert psi rangle to the positive reals so that is not the defining property of langle psi rvert is that correct
509503 our universe consists of about dark matter dm such matter is the main stuff of galaxies also black holes bh live in galaxies we know that dm is subject to gravitational interaction so bh should absorb dm and increase its event horizon comparing such process with hawking radiation what process is more prevailing
509541 keeping it simple what is the physics approach to current in wire connected to battery how does the electric field behave ive read somewhere that contrary to the common conception electrons dont really flow as water in hose so what is really going on there how is energy transported at the speed of light if electrons dont flow like very fast water
509650 newtons explanation of gravity as an attractive force seems to have been superseded by einsteins explanation of gravity as warping of space time was there any advances in math and science that was not known in newtons time that would have laid the foundation for einstein to give more accurate description of gravity in general relativity
509803 have been reading learning about the double slit experiment its implications in quantum theory and how it explained that particles can behave as both waves and particles know that the wave function is probability of the location of the particle and that shooting the electrons through the double slits causes an interference pattern associated with multiple waves this though not making intuitive sense in relation to how anything can even exist as wave is something can follow however have read heard that an observer collapses the wave function into single point this is what caused the electrons to actually show up on the wall behind the slit however feynman admittedly as thought experiment suggested that putting an observer prior to the slits would cause the electrons to fly through as particles and leave no interference pattern on the back wall what is an observer how and why would the electron know it is being observed and therefore cause it to change behavior
510002 am aware that constant force causes constant acceleration but friction can counteract this however if push something across table for example it seems no matter how hard push the object travels at constant velocity even if apply more force than the kinetic friction the object seems to always travel at the same velocity as my hand does this mean am not actually applying constant force
510234 let us suppose that we have particle of energy 2c 2c can we say that for ultra relativistic limit rightarrow infty pc or in the non relativistic case rightarrow mc
510399 we have all heard people saying that to lift an object of mass you have to apply force equal to its weight mg but isnt it getting the force equal to its weight from the surface to which it is attached to normal force why it is willing to change that equilibrium state by getting the same force from us as from the surface consider the situation devoid of any resistance think we must be applying slightly more force to it in order to move it even with constant velocity at least at the start and balancing the force of gravity afterwards
510417 does the launching of satellite need the consideration of the general theory of relativity gr
510506 the de broglie wave equation states lambda frac where lambda is the wavelength of the particle is planks constant and is the momentum of the particle momentum is usually written mv where is the mass and is the velocity of the particle but presumably is the relative velocity between the observer and the particle so does this mean that the wavelength of particle depends upon the relative motion between the particle and the observer or perhaps more accurately when particle is incoming to another particle in as much as an interaction between the particles depends on their relative speed or the energy of impact it thus also has something to do with their relative wavelengths is that conclusion or simply restatement of the premise using different words that mean the same thing
511067 in the nature paper published by google they say to demonstrate quantum supremacy we compare our quantum processor against state of the art classical computers in the task of sampling the output of pseudo random quantum circuit random circuits are suitable choice for benchmarking because they do not possess structure and therefore allow for limited guarantees of computational hardness we design the circuits to entangle set of quantum bits qubits by repeated application of single qubit and two qubit logical operations sampling the quantum circuit output produces set of bitstrings for example owing to quantum interference the probability distribution of the bitstrings resembles speckled intensity pattern produced by light interference in laser scatter such that some bitstrings are much more likely to occur than others classically computing this probability distribution becomes exponentially more difficult as the number of qubits width and number of gate cycles depth grow so from what can tell they configure their qubits into pseudo randomly generated circuit which when run puts the qubits into state vector that represents probability distribution over possible states of the qubits but that distribution is intractable to calculate or even estimate via sampling using classical computer simulation but they sample it by looking at the state of the qubits after running the circuit many times isnt this just an example of creating system whose output is intractable to calculate and then calculating it by simply observing the output of the system it sounds similar to saying if spill this pudding cup on the floor the exact pattern it will form is very chaotic and intractable for any supercomputer to calculate but just invented new special type of computer this pudding cup and im going to do the calculation by spilling it on the floor and observing the result have achieved pudding supremacy which clearly is not impressive at all in my example im doing calculation thats intractable for any classical computer but theres no obvious way to extrapolate this method towards anything actually useful why is googles experiment different edit to elaborate on my intuition here the thing consider impressive about classical computers is their ability to simulate other systems not just themselves when setting up classical circuit the question we want to answer is not which transistors will be lit up once we run current through this we want to answer questions like whats or what happens when andromeda collides with the milky way if were shown classical computer predicting which transistors will light up when current is run through it it wouldnt be obvious to me that were any closer to answering the interesting questions
511232 as far as gather before perturbation is applied the eigenspace associated with the degenerate energy is multidimensional but after applying the perturbation this space splits into different eigenspaces if we use non degenerate perturbation theory then we would end up dividing by zero when calculating the coefficients for the linear combination of the perturbed state the way to get around this is apparently to diagonalise the perturbation hamiltonian with basis of the unperturbed degenerate eigenstates and this is what fail to understand why is it that diagonalising the perturbation hamiltonian will solve the problem of dividing by zero also how can understand visually what is happening to the linear transformation on the eigenspace before and after diagonalising the perturbation hamiltonian another problem have is understanding the process of calculating the energy and state corrections after finding basis in which the perturbation hamiltonian is diagonalised every example or explanation have found is incredibly abstract would love to see simple example with matrices and vectors if possible if anybody has links to good resources or can be bothered to go through one in an answer find matrix vector representations to be much more intuitive lastly another question that have just thought of are these eigenstates that we find to diagonalise the perturbation hamiltonian with precisely the eigenstates of the new total hamiltonian and in that case are they regarded as the first order corrections to the space of eigenstates whatever that would mean
511372 we define hat sqrt frac omega hbar left hat frac hat right hat dagger sqrt frac omega hbar left hat frac hat right lowering and raising operators respectively clearly these are conjugates in the regular complex scalar sense but we label them and treat them as hermitian adjoints complex transpose since the differential operator can be represented by an infinitely large matrix why do we not need to take the transpose part of it into account
511473 in relation to this other question that asked is there anything more chaotic than fluid turbulence had assumed that there are methods by which the level of chaotic ness of system could be measured for comparison with other non linear systems however several comments called that into question proposing that its either or either system is chaotic or its not so am wondering if that is true or are there parameters that can be used to determine and compare how chaotic one system is compared to another one comment to the other question mentioned the lyapunov exponent admit that im not very experienced in non linear dynamical systems but was also thinking about other possible parameters such as properties of the chaotic attractor number or range of different distance scales that develop or perhaps the speed or frequency of when bifurcations occur so in general is it possible to quantify the chaotic ness of dynamical system if so what parameters are available
511572 let us define new thermodynamic function such that dx tds pdv where is the temperature of the system is the entropy is the pressure and is the volume now since is state function if it isnt then explain why we can derive some relations using similar to the way we derive maxwells relations using and and if we do that then we get left frac partial partial right left frac partial partial right but if we see one of the maxwells relations it states that left frac partial partial right left frac partial partial right both the equations contradict each other where did go wrong and why is the equation which derived from incorrect ps understood that was wrong in assuming as state function so my next question is how to prove that is not state function
511789 im aware of similar question being asked in do rainbow shows spectral lines the response to this question is that the body producing the light is not the water droplet that merely diffracts it but rather the sun which acts as black body and thus produces complete spectrum however it is not entirely true that the sun is black body like all stars it has an spectral class with absorption lines am wondering why these lines are not observable in the rainbow or when decompossing sunlight with prism in otherwise uncontrolled conditions are they simply too narrow to be seen without optical instruments is it product of the light source not being coherent how is this consistent with the possibility of obtaining spectra from distant stars in which the spectral lines are visible
511983 assume we have quantum system and its wavefunction psi but the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of some operator the component of the angular momentum hat in this case how are we going to measure is it always the case that we can write psi as sum of eigenfunctions of hat and from that we extract an measurement
512462 does it means that the particle assume it has single wave function can show up on any of infinite number of detectors at the same time or as hint by the single shot double slit experiment that it must have interacted with its own clone as far as know there can only be particle for every collapse of single wave function at any time so how come it is suggested that they can be in two places at once
512902 the question asked was disputed amongst xviie century physicists at least before the invention of calculus reference spinoza principles of descartes philosophy part ii descartes physics proposition xix here spinoza following descartes denies that body the direction of which is changing is at rest for some instant https archive org details principlesdescar00spin page how is it solved by modern physics if the object is at rest at some instant one cannot understand how the movement starts again due to the inertia principle if the object is not at rest at some instant it seems necessary that there is some instant at which it goes in both directions for example some moment at which ball bouncing on the ground is both falling and going back up in which false assumptions does this dilemma originate according to modern physics
512912 the principle is often stated as self explanatory the sentence the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames could mean very different things at least from my point of view does it mean that there is special class of frames that are inertial and some that are not and that in this special class the laws of physics are invariant or should the property being inertial in translation one relatively to the other be seen as an equivalence relation that partitions the set of frames in such way that in each cell of this partition there are invariant laws of physics though these invariant laws are not the same for all the classes of frames
513026 was wondering there are several examples where energy comes in very handy many problems in kinematics which are really challenging if you could use only forces can be solved effortlessly by converting into terms of energy illustrative image what makes most force calculations tedious and energy calculations dead simple intuitively is it right to think of energy as more fundamental quantity than force
513449 as understand it when papers and books refer to cavity qed they simply mean the strong coupling regime of two level system to photon field in resonator jaynes cummings and variants thereof in other words could understand the whole problem using standard quantum optics indeed many quantum optics textbooks dont include treatment of quantum electrodynamics lagrangians etc what would be missing in cavity qed if had never learnt about quantum electrodynamcis
513474 was thinking about something that never understood when took my qm course if have an infinite square well say for and infty otherwise in the region of interest the schr dinger equation reads frac hbar 2m frac partial psi partial psi so the differential equation to solve is frac partial psi partial psi with frac 2me hbar as usual here remember that was taught that we use the solutions psi sinkx coskx which obviously satisfies the de however never quite understood why we dont pick psi ae ikx be ikx since this function also would satisfy the de during my qm course always struggled choosing when to use an exponential solution versus sinusoidal one could someone shed some light on this matter there must be clear reason to choose one over the other when facing new problem
513839 the following text is method for finding the magnetic field as described in purcells electricity and magnetism page the top part measure the force on the particle when its velocity is bf repeat with bf in some other direction now find bf that will make textbf textbf times textbf fit all these results why do we need two velocity vectors for given velocity textbf there will be corresponding force textbf therefore the equation textbf textbf times textbf will be equivalent to qv qv qv three equations three unknowns am missing something
513874 consider ball that strikes stationary box and has momentum mv if the ball rebounds with the same speed it had before the collision its momentum is mv therefore the box must have momentum of 2mv in order for momentum to be conserved however this would mean the kinetic energy after the collision is more than the kinetic energy before the collision where would this energy come from or is the situation described impossible
514829 just out of plain curiosity want to ask what are is the physical interpretations of the gamma matrices if there is none is it right to assume that it is just mathematical fudge factor
514883 have hypothetical question that hopefully makes sense considering only the rudimentary amount of knowledge have on relativity assume am in spaceship orbiting around spherical satellite at certain fixed radius the satellite sends data to the ship via radio something like satellite internet or other long range data radio using electromagnetic signals would the download speed received data rate seen on board ship be faster or slower compared to when am stationary with respect to the satellite also consider that attenuation is negligible what initially thought was that time dilation would make my clock in the spaceship tick slower hence the signal from the satellite would be received faster thought should add this to clarify my train of thought that led to the question please do note that it is hypothetical question comment pointed out that spherically symmetric em wave is impossible therefore have taken down the diagram and the statement regarding so
515059 if einstein was in an elevator in free fall in vacuum and in his upturned hand was miniature elevator containing miniature einstein who had miniature elevator in his hand and so on in ever decreasing sizes until the last elevator is on the scale of the planck length would all these objects theoretically fall at the same rate
515169 so apparently in may all of the si base units were redefined to be relative to the planck constant instead of relying on physical objects like the kilogram prototype in paris basement plancks constant was defined as just number its not measured value anymore it is the value my question is why was this exact number chosen in the measured value of was so why did they choose this arbitrary value of instead of something more exact like 62607x10 that would have been within the margin of error so it could have worked just fine
515204 if alternating current switches directions back and forth periodically it seems like to me that current would go forward bit and then almost immediately back track the exact same distance if this is the case then how does ac ever get to where we want it to could be misconceiving ac in some way
515259 was wondering about this question since learned about rolling motion in the chapter on rotational mechanics was unable to come to solid conclusion due to the reasons mentioned below the following diagram shows ball on frictionless inclined plane and the forces acting on it the forces acting on the ball are shown in red and are the normal contact force and the gravitational force of attraction mg qualitatively determined the torque of these forces about two axes one passing through the centre of mass of the ball of uniform density and the other passing through the point of contact of the ball and the inclined plane both of these axes are perpendicular to the screen when the axis passes through the centre of the ball the torque exerted by mg is zero as its line of action meets the axis further the torque exerted by is also zero due to the same reason there are no other forces so net torque about this axis is zero and this tempts us to conclude the ball slides down the inclined plane when the axis passes through the point of contact the torque exerted by is zero but the torque exerted by mg is non zero this means the ball must roll it rotates while moving down the inclined plane this conclusion is contradictory to the former case so what exactly will happen to ball kept on frictionless inclined plane will it slide or roll the following diagram is visual interpretation of my question if the terms slide and roll confuses the reader where the red arrow denotes the orientation of the ball image courtesy my own work please note the question ball rolling down an inclined plane where does the torque come from discusses the case of ball rolling on an inclined plane where friction is present since the question rolling in smooth inclined plane is marked as duplicate of the former and has no sufficient details planned to ask new question with additional information

516203 question uniform rod of mass is placed almost vertically on frictionless floor since it is not perfectly vertical it will begin to fall down when released from rest have seen solutions online for this problem and while solving this problem it is assumed that the end point of the rod that is in contact with the floor will continue to stay in contact with the floor till the rod in its entirety hits the floor horizontally it is this assumption that lets us determine the normal force from the floor however how does one show that this assumption is true or is it taken to be an additional constraint of the problem check the figure in d1 to verify if youve got the right setup in mind duplicates in se d1 will falling rod always remain in contact with the ground d2 rod falling on frictionless surface d3 equation of motion for falling rod with one end touching frictionless surface believe the op in d1 has asked the same question along with other questions but it has been closed as off topic simon robinson one of the answerers in d2 has also expressed concerns about this ask this question because it hasnt been addressed properly on se dont feel that the answer to this question is specific only to this vertical rod problem instead feel that this question is onto something basic that dont yet understand regarding the necessary constraints that need to be specified in physics problem my attempt the problem with this question is that feel like have given all the information thats necessary to predict the entire dynamics of the rods motion after its release im unable to accept the idea that rod cannot lose contact constraint must be specified as an additional piece of information to solve this problem if we accept that its not an additional constraint then we should be able to show that the rods end point cannot lose contact but thats the problem ive been thinking about it for days and cant seem to find way to show that im unable to see anything violated if it loses contact at some point during its fall after it loses contact it simply rotates about the center of mass with constant angular velocity see and the rods com falls down with acceleration mathbf frac mathbf cm dt boldsymbol tau cm rightarrow text cm cm omega is constant tag thanks for taking the time to read this question apologize if have violated any code of conduct any insight that addresses my question would be greatly appreciated further clarification if needed clarifications which will hopefully help physe users to better understand my question are made here reading the following information is not necessary to answer my question it is important to note that even if the rods bottom end point loses contact with the floor at some point during the fall the centre of mass of the rod will continue to fall vertically straight down just as before but now with acceleration mathbf so the fact that the com falls vertically straight down cannot be used to prove that the rods bottom end point doesnt lose contact with the floor com falls vertically straight down not rightarrow the rods bottom end point doesnt lose contact with the floor
516371 vec cdot frac partial vec partial frac frac partial partial griffiths states this result in his derivation of the pontying vector but have absolutely no idea where it came from or how to go about deriving it myself any help is appreciated
516419 my physics textbook states that in measuring the time period of pendulum it is advised to measure the time between consecutive passage though the mean position in the same direction this results in better accuracy than measuring time between consecutive passage through an extreme position why is one method of finding the time period better than the other how can this affect the accuracy of the final result think it shouldnt make any difference as the time taken for one full oscillation is independent of the choice of the start end point is the statement in the book really correct
516609 long story short brother of mine made joke about how stupid it is to celebrate the earth making one trip around the sun new years eve so got curious and was wondering how the first physicists could guess that revolution of the earth around the sun takes 25xxx days ive tried my luck on internet but didnt find anything simple enough to understand ive read about keplers law and there are nice formulas but how does he get to this and how the first people who knew that earth was revolving around the sun could guess how much time an entire revolution did take asked my brother and he told me if hed have to do it he would simply watch at the stars and map them do that every night and count the days until he came back to the exact same position of the first night is that realistic
