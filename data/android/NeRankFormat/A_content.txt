custom kernels one popular set of kernels is those provided by chevyno1 you can also download them via the premium version of the rom manager make nandroid clockworkmod backup before using these kernels youll also want to get setcpu to make the most out of these kernels start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 2ghz if your phone is stable up to the 2ghz range then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels if you start getting force closes then switch back to low voltage kernel basically each phone of the same phone brand model varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors so may have motorola droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them these phones werent necessarily designed to run like this
19 no and even more so with the latest versions of android used to use them but ive stopped and everything has been better since stopped using task manager killer there is an app called watchdog if youd like to be notified about process using ton of cpu for long period of time which then will give you the option to kill that run away process
21 sometimes when an app crashes or gets to state that its not response its nice to be able to shut it down manually but as for slowness issues task manager isnt necessary as the os itself handles multitasking better now
22 see this http geekfor me faq you shouldnt be using task killer with android faq why you shouldn be using task killer with android geekfor me xda developers tl dr version android is hard coded to automatically kill task when more memory is needed android is hard coded to automatically kill task when it done doing what it needs to do android is hard coded to automatically kill task when you haven returned to it in long time most services while possibly running in the background use very little memory when not actively doing something content provider is only doing something when there is notification for it to give otherwise it uses very little memory killing process when it isn ready only causes it to have to reload itself and start from scratch when it needed again because task is likely running in the background for reason killing it will only cause it to re spawn as soon as the activity that was using it looks for it again and it will just have to start over again killing certain processes can have undesirable side effects not receiving text messages alarms not going off and force closes just to name few the only true way to prevent something from running at all on your phone would be to uninstall the apk most applications will exit themselves if you get out of it by hitting back until it closes rather than hitting the home button but even with hitting home android will eventually kill it once it been in the background for while as android was designed you dont need to kill apps
33 yes you should have task killer app but not for the reasons you think ive had runaway processes maybe watchdog can help like google maps which then ran twice once to kill my cpu ram and once to actually work had to use the task killer to kill both instances and then run the normal one rarely will you actually need to manually kill anything but like all programs sometimes stuff happens ive had apps crash the entire phone and they were not running in root or anything
46 you will need to push the apk to the phone to the system partition to the folder system app or system priv app when using android using adb you can find more info about adb here http android dls com wiki index phptitle adb in order to write to system you likely have to remount it read write adb shell su mount rwremount system or do it entirely from the hosts adb adb root adb remount now you can place the apk adb push my app apk sdcard adb shell su cd sdcard mv my app apk system app or when using android or higher mv my app apk system priv app afterwards if the flags are not already set change the permissions all system apps need to have the permissions rw you can also change them via adb with the command chmod path to your file though its quite old this may help after you have placed the apk you need to reboot your device for example with adb reboot
48 go to settings wireless networks mobile networks make sure the data roaming checkbox is unchecked that will keep you from roaming accidentally since you will have to enable it if you want to enable it and use roaming lightly there are some apps in the market that will track your data usage for you however in my experience roaming abroad has been so expensive that even roaming for few minutes of data is not worth it usually either try to find public hotspot or get prepaid sim card with data
49 go to settings applications manage applications select the application you want to remove click uninstall not all applications may be removed some are locked down by your carrier phone vendor
51 it is very simple tool but like apndroid to totally disable data while leaving basic phone functionality intact it has nice toggle widget there are also settings that can help with this on my nexus one there are settings here settings wireless network settings mobile networks your mileage may vary depending on your model you can play with those settings to disable roaming or data
55 quick easy way to uninstall an application is to hold down on its icon and then drag it to the trash can at the bottom of the screen like you would if you were removing shortcut from your home screen however hold the icon over the trash can for few seconds until drop to uninstall appears
61 you can uninstall an application from the market or from the manage applications settings screen from marketplace start the market app hit the menu button and select downloads find the app you want to uninstall and select it hit the uninstall button at the bottom from manage applications from your home screen hit the menu button and select settings select applications select manage applications find the app you want to uninstall and select it hit the uninstall button at the top edit wanted to add 3rd method that rohan singh had in his answer from your home screen tap and hold on the icon of the application you want to uninstall when the trash can appears near the bottom center of the screen drag and hold the icon there after the tap hold drag hold some text will appear indicating that you can uninstall by dropping the applications icon on the trash can release your finger over the trash can and youll be taken to the same uninstall screen you can get to through manage applications in your settings
98 youll need root to delete the sound file but this should be it delete system media audio ui camera click ogg repercussions it wont play the sound anymore alternatively you could download another camera app that does not produce camera sound
117 check out piece of software such as mobile defense which gives you remote tracking and wiping of your phone
122 when youre in the camera just use the normal volume to turn sound all the way down this worked for me on stock nexus one running froyo
165 does it have the potential to brick the device although it has become relatively simple on the droid some methods of rooting pose more risk than others so in short yes there is potential will it void my warranty it depends on your manufacturer and their warranty policies but technically this does void your warranty in most cases will stop getting updates again this depends some manufacturer provide updates for rooted devices while others do not these will usually continue to come in and may unroot your phone if you install them or even require you to unroot manually before you can receive their updates if you install third party rom then theres nothing else to do with your original manufacturer will the cops show up at my front door the next day certainly hope not but if rooting involves cracking bootloader it could theoretically get you in legal trouble in some jurisdictions anti circumvention laws etc edit also be aware that there are different root methods based on which current build you are running edit it may as of may prevent you from installing some apps google play can now prevent rooted users from downloading certain apps
166 does it have the potential to brick the device yes it is possible to brick your phone but should be very unlikely usually there is way out of even what seems to be brick if you do not know what you are doing and want to use the adb method entering shell commands manually to root your phone then be sure to follow all of the directions exactly as listed if you somehow brick your phone then it does not matter how good your phone insurance is with your cell provider if they find out you rooted or attempted to they will not fix it if you do somehow brick your phone then do not panic try these things post thread to where you downloaded the root program or where the root method was posted post to xda under their questions and answers section search the web someone else has probably had the same problem as you it is quite possible to unbrick your phone but it will take some time and patience to sort it out will it void my warranty yes but in most cases you can restore your phone to condition that theyll never know that you rooted your phone and sometimes they do not even check to see if you rooted your phone when you return it will stop getting updates yes and no if you flash rom yes but most likely that rom has constant updates such as cyanogenmod also if you root and keep stock rom you will still get ota update notifications but running an update will un root your phone anything else should be aware of may the force be with you no really its relatively painless process with lot of these easy one touch unroot tools and even then there is plethora of guides and help from xda to guide you and troubleshoot any problems you might have but if you are happy with your phone just the way it is then dont root
196 using the trackball or pad for this is pretty accurate you can easily go up down left and right with it
198 even if you do have gps enabled its only used when you are using an application that is actually requiring gps location services so the best way to get your apps to use gps location is turning on gps by default
217 use appbrain because it provides nice site and it makes it really easy to install apps onto my phone additionally im finding that many bloggers that are reviewing apps are putting links to the appbrain page for the app in their posts this makes it really easy to mark something for install while im at my computer reading the blog posts and then install it when get chance edit by izzy appbrain offers an alternative and much cleaner interface to the google play store which offers several advantages search results are much less limited pages apps results much more than play offers search results gray out possible spam offensive and otherwise harmful apps you still can see them though but its quite clear what to skip app details page gives the most important details at glance its easy to see what permissions are requested and if those form potential dangerous combinations called concerns at appbrain thats automatically pointed out by warning sign on the permissions tab their app an alternative to the playstore app enables you to skip single or all updates on per app base which keeps your list of pending updates quite clean for installation you will be redirected to google play in the past appbrain had separate app for this called the fast web installer but unfortunately this app was banned by google so even for batch updates the playstore app will now be opened for each app separately not appbrains fault appbrain app market source appbrain click images for larger variants still count their website as much better alternative to the google play website and the same is to be said for their app though for installations it has to redirect you as described above

239 take look at tasker it pretty much allows you to automate and set rules for everything on your phone based on times of the day what apps you are using your location you can set profile to automatically turn your gps on or off based on almost any condition you can imagine
249 to root your phone means to gain administrative rights on the file system of your phone in linux root is the username of the master admin with root access you can install and uninstall anything you want on the phone most phones come with limited access regarding what you can and cant do on it this isnt necessarily bad thing because it can keep users from accidentally breaking something they shouldnt mess with on the phone especially in regards to the operating system however many manufacturers limit your rights to things that arent really so mission critical too and rooting the phone gets around this if you have few unnecessary applications bloatware pre installed on your phone that you cannot uninstall rooting will give you this ability it will also allow you to upgrade to newer versions of android before your phones manufacturer and or cell provider make the updates available to you be warned though that rooting may void your warranty for more info on what rooting enables you to do with your phone check out this question
250 to gain root administrator access to phone root is the user with uid which is the equivalent of full system administration account it means you have the permission to do anything anything includes opening protected ports for example for wifi tethering update and upgrade the os and all software replace the operating system with your own software full access to every file on the machine and the ability to delete any file including the entire operating system
255 when you root your phone you are unlocking the administrative privileges of the phone which by default are locked by the manufacturer its similar to jailbreaking in the iphone world rooting your device allows you to do things like overclock or underclock your cpu delete those preloaded apps that your phone wont delete like amazon mp3 or corp calendar install certain apps that require root access load custom roms the manufacturers dont want you to have access to these options for number of reasons including but not limited to they want to control and ensure specific user experience certain carriers require that certain functions are locked out because they want you to pay for them or because they are incompatible with their network if you dont know what you are doing you can brick render useless your phone or at least cause enough problems where youll be calling tech support demanding to know why your phone doesnt work
258 in short it means to get administrator access to the phone to do things that normal non administrator user of the phone cannot do
259 dont know of any way to do wifi tethering without root before you can however use bluetooth or usb cable with pdanet which does not require root
262 the above answers are already correct but just for bit of nerd reference in all unix based systems there is root user who has access to any and all functions available by the operating system this is very powerful and dangerous privilege because once you are root you can do anything and much of what you can do can completely destroy the system this is why when you administer server you usually dont do it as root so that you can take advantage of the operating system saying umm you dont want to do that when you accidentally ask it to wipe clean the entire hard drive at 3am edit was going to modify my answer to say in the other answers but then realized that the effect this would have would be to render the comments beneath assuming theyre still there nonsensical im not seeing strike through in the text editor so ill just amend here that should have said in the other answers rather than in the above answers
264 does it have the potential to brick the device yes will it void my warranty definitely will stop getting updates yes if you install custom rom will the cops show up at my front door the next day yes but only if youre chinese and even then only if your police administration is near enough to beijing and you should be aware that it is security risk root user has access to the entire phone including all of its functionality and the memory of all running applications backdoor could be installed in custom rom it might not even be to your disadvantage but your phone might become part of botnet
286 yes there is check out the application better terminal or android terminal emulator both are support from
327 this is bit of an amendment to everything essencially rooting is jailbreaking you are user you dont have administrator access to your own phone rooting is the process of getting access to the root user once you have root there are some fun things you can do remove system apps like sprints nascar or nfl apps use tools like open tethering to do wifi tethering for free underclock or overclock your processor underclocking with setcpu helps keep battery usage up while not really affecting performance when your phone is in idle etc install custom recovery tool nandroid backup complete dump of your androids internal memory to the sd card which allows you to do very clean backup and literally roll your android back to that point when needed also allows you to swap operating systems in minutes by having backups of each recently rooting is getting more efficient and with click rooting coming up it should be breeze for most people just set up and let it run for half an hr the only risk is bricking your phone screwing up some critical software thus making it impossible to start it up or install fix
342 droidstack seems to be the ticket android market link
344 there are couple of apps out there like droidstack and stackwidget both of the apps can work together ive just installed them but so far you cant seem to answer or respond to questions with them you can though follow your questions and get notifications when you get answers droidstack is question browser and stackwidget lets you watch specific questions there is also topstack for question browsing and soflair for reputation monitoring having tried them
365 if you are talking about making link that goes directly to the app in the market on an android device yes just append the package name to the market detailsid or market searchq pname to create the link in your example above the package name is de schildbach oeffi if you dont know the package name you can get it from androlib its pain because their pages are so busy but if you cant find it just do text search for package name just to be clear this link format only works when clicked on and android market enabled device update yes you now access the full android market on the website and when you use the link format that therefromhere mentions in his answer with http market users clicking it on their phone will be brought to app in the market and users clicking on it on the web will be brought to the apps market web page edit no the android market can only be accessed on android devices more specifically only android devices with the android market enabled
404 you shouldnt need to worry about running an anti virus on your phone would recommend running one on your pc though and having it set to scan peripheral devices when you plug in your phone and it gets mounted as mass storage device the desktops antivirus will scan the phone for viruses signatures and you will be doing the minimum to ensure your security it is an illusion to believe that just because you are running nix or osx you wont benefit from the security afforded by av software that said you dont need to spend anything to get good lean program especially in linux
412 there have been few reports of trojans that basically pretend to do something but they are actually texting short codes charing you money or stealing data or something however im not sure how these anti virus programs could actually counter that as they dont have anyway to monitor what these other apps are actually doing all you really need to do is take close look at the permissions requested when you install an app and ask yourself should this app need full internet access and contacts access and location
414 the requirement being that you must be rooted you could get titanium backup and back up your phone using that the reason for using titanium backup is so that you can selectively restore parts of your data if you were to install different version and or build of android nandroid backup is good for having safe image to fall back on but it isnt good for restoring data on top of new os installation there are side effects sometimes
425 think you answered your own question navigation uses lot of power it needs constant use of gps along with reading the map and processing text to speech throw in another power intensive activity like bluetooth or the phones speaker or calling or data etc and its very conceivable that it would drain power faster than it can pull it from charger especially car charger though the exact specifics would vary from phone to phone here is great list of the things that use the most power on phone
428 as of today no there is nothing public like matt says you can find this out through other sites instead of asking here simple google search will give you results of speculation and rumor like this http mashable com netflix android app
432 there is nothing available while it is theoretically possible with the hardware in practice it would be very difficult to implement and would probably need custom rom that supported it even the tools for doing this on desktop aircrack etc generally require specific wireless chipsets and drivers to do wireless packet capture edit theres now project that got monitor mode working on the galaxy s2 and the google nexus one see http bcmon blogspot de
593 havent had chance to try it myself yet but ive heard good things about maverick maverick for google android code sector there is both limited free and pay version
990 froyo android added support for displaying text in hebrew and arabic among other languages including the needed fonts unfortunately previous versions do not have hebrew support in the stock source though would not be surprised if device maker added support to their device on an ad hoc basis
1059 this question is along these same lines what causes battery to drain faster than it can charge so there may or may not be an app designed to drain the battery but you probably just need to turn on an app that uses the gps this will help to fully drain your battery but dont know that doing so before recharging will extend the battery life
1074 use oilcan greasemonkey on steroids for android
1085 just found voice choice which claims to do what want but havent tried it yet because its big purchasing decision at will have to discuss with the family and check with my financial advisor ill report back if it actually does the job or not
1107 the menu you get when you press the power button should give you list of options including shutdown restart etc if it doesnt your phones manufacturer might have left it out of the rom
1108 know that my phone htcs evo actually has diagnostic tool thats sole purpose is to drain the battery as fast as possible open up your dialer and enter you dont need to press send or anything recent update for the evo blocked these tools so hopefully you can still access them you can also look up device specific codes if yours happens to be different rooted users have found way to get these tools back the utility turns up brightness all the way prevents sleep turns on the camera and flash turns on the gps and constantly polls it etc basically everything that can drain the battery but not damage the phone is done ie it doesnt constantly vibrate because that would probably be bad
1117 you can customize the notification settings for both gmail and messaging in each of the apps separately in gmail press menu and go to more settings and look at the notification settings section in messaging press menu then settings and look at the notification settings section
1118 use the app quick boot to restart your device rooted device answer seems to be given partially here ive rooted my phone now what what do gain from rooting use the app quick boot to restart your device start the quick boot app and choose reboot and there you go
1158 the items in the list are determined by which installed apps support the action send intent any app that supports that intent will be included in the list dont think there is way for users to modify the list other than installing uninstalling applications
1160 keeping the microsd is probably the main thing so since thats the plan already its just the phone to go couldnt swear to this but used it when selling my g1 uninstall everything except astro file browser or similar use astro to wipe out any app related folders remove astro use the factory data reset on its under privacy power up and check its greeting you as new user power off remove sim card power up and check it does even less power off send
1193 its important to understand the differences between platform like android and the traditional dumb phone platform with android very few applications are special by special mean the os is aware of them and treats them differently in android an application actually has to manage notifications themselves theres no way for the os to somehow figure it out and expose setting for it notification sound customization has to be exposed by the individual application developer not through android itself when an application creates status bar notification by default android will play the sound that you set in the default notification setting but the application can explicitly provide different sound to play the application would have to manage that themselves it would be nice if android allowed apps to register for custom notifications and then it could provide central location for all of them but im not aware of facility for doing this if particular application doesnt provide support contact them and ask them to add it take away star or two from your rating in the marketplace and explain why you did so many developers actually listen compare that to the traditional dumb phone platform where everything is tightly coupled and controlled the os can easily expose settings for individual apps because theyre baked in and dont really change
1234 perform factory reset then write to the memory and reset again this is the best way have found to prevent data remnance was aware that with magnetic based drive there is almost always data remnanace believe the standard to effectively erase info on magnetic drive is erasing and re writing over the drive times dont quote me on those number was under the impression that once you erased data from flash storage it was gone for good but recalled the story of woman finding porn on her refurbished evo so asked about data remnance at superuser on flash memory and found that data sometimes can remain after it is deleted the recommendation there was formatting writing to the memory and formatting again to format as the answers above suggested performed factory reset this can be done one of two ways on the droid go to the settings menu choose privacy then choose factory data reset do hard reset ultimately just did the factory reset because was too lazy to load the system memory up and suspect that the factory reset is sufficient but its good to know what the risks are
1236 usually your apps are downloaded using your browser for accessing them you open your browser press menu more downloads
1241 if you want to add shortcut on your home screen to your downloads folder or any other folder for that matter get astro file manager free the app is pretty useful on its own but it also adds the option to create shortcut directly to any folder on the homescreen to do this simply long click on the homescreen choose shortcuts then choose astro then choose the particular folder you want shortcut to had astro for while before realized could do this because the option is deceiving at first look thought it would create shortcut to the app not to specific folder like it does edit after reading keiths comment realized you are probably talking about market downloads in that case do what al everett said
1243 yes open up the market app open the menu and choose downloads
1272 id get virtual machine and run windows in that for updates will probably be the easiest for you if youre not comfortable with flashing usually the roms for samsung come out as odin packages program samsung uses for flashing guess the forum for galaxy on xda has alot of resources to get you started http forum xda developers com forumdisplay phpf if the above doesnt help you you can use custom recovery clockworkmod recovery has just been updated today follow the steps on http forum xda developers com showthread phpt with this you will be able to flash updates from samsung when the community releases them as update zip from your sdcard this requires root on your device but is probably your only solution without windows before you start with this sit down and read the resources on the forum flashing wrong firmware could damage your phone be aware of your phone version the above guide is for the galaxy i9000 international version
1279 the anonym with the vague answer is correct just not nearly complete for keyboard less phones like my n1 the trackball or trackpad can be used to scroll down the list of suggestions and that will enter them into the text field for editing for most phones with hardware keyboard like your droid use the pad next to the keyboard to select the suggestion for editing some of them still retain trackball or trackpad once you have the correct entry in the search box tap it to continue editing btw just discovered this and its going to make my life lot easier
1294 yes rooting is usually but not always required the following are some options android screencast probably one of the more easier and popular soln google code project android vnc have to search for it can only post link at time right now droid explorer app from marketplace android vnc server guide that uses different apk from either soln above try them out and see which one gives you the best options
1295 maybe you should give the android notifier over at googlecode try when using mac or linux the android desktop notifier works fine when using windows
1312 if you update to the latest version of google search in the market it includes pencil icon next to each item in the search history for this exact problem tapping the pencil loads the search term into the search box but doesnt initiate search for it
1324 you can install the terminal emulator from google alternatively there is the better terminal emulator pro tried the terminal emulator on non rooted phone and it seemed to work fine better terminal emulator pro includes the dropbear ssh client which can be launched from the command line or via launcher more info from the authors
1346 you can try battery notif free from android market bardcode scanner compatible store link
1347 battery indicator is free app that does this https www appbrain com app com darshancomputing batteryindicator unfortunately it doesnt replace the stock icon it just adds another that displays the numbers im not aware of any way to replace or change the stock icon even with root access
1350 if you use cyanogenmod theres an option to show numeric battery percentage and numeric signal strength in dbm on the status bar
1362 not that am aware of however you could try double twist for similar functionality
1368 yes you can actually use doubletwist in combination with tunesync or tunesync alone to sync with itunes although you are limited to songs that are not drmd by apple you can also do it without any app on your phone with notpod windows only the only drawbacks that am aware with either of these are not being able to use drm and people have reported some unreliability the problem in general with syncing android with itunes is that it may work today but if apple changes something in an update you may get locked out until someone comes up with another work around if you are all android now id recommend on cutting itunes out of the picture all together edit heres couple other options ive come across that are pretty awesome dazzboard isyncr wifi add on you need an app and desktop client the app costs little but the desktop software is free this one seems like the coolest option so far edit happened upon another app music withme syncs your phone itunes over wifi or 3g it doesnt stream the music it download it to your phone also dont think it can handle drmd tracks its little pricey at especially with the currently less than stellar reviews but it may be one to watch
1383 your mileage with cyanogen mod cm depends on the phone you are running if you have an htc phone you will not have any htc sense running or installed at all so htc widgets will not work this is hurdle for many htc phone users that enjoy some of those widgets personally ive been able to find adequate replacements to them so that wasnt barrier for me if you are not using an htc phone there probably wont be lot of cons again though you might not be able to use any stock widgets that came on your phone but you might have different dialer and contact app then what you are used to do you connect to an email system at work such as an exchange mail system do and that was one of the reasons for me not using cm not that it didnt work but there was some functionality was missing few settings and didnt like the way the contact app managed the exchange contacts whatever htc uses for their builds worked better imo so use an htc based rom as saboogu states hardware will make difference too but cm team is good about refining their rom and working out kinks so that it functions well even on older phones if you are already rooted make nand backup first follow this guide wrote keeping in mind it was written for an evo but most info still applies to other phones once you have backup then wipe and flash and go from there see if you like it and the feature set this way if you hate it you can easily restore your backup
1388 the biggest goal of cyanogenmod in my eyes is to provide back porting of functionality to older phones who are not getting the latest version of the android os the g1 it also gives plenty of little tweaks here and there to add some functionality to your phone that you may not have gotten before it also typically requires rooting your phone so you also get those benefits too although cm releases stable versions your stability may vary youll most likely see more reboots from cm than stock rom or other miscellaneous bugs
1397 another confirmation that the back tick isnt on swype but you dont need to dig that deep to switch long press in the input area choose input method and then you can select the samsung or android keyboards another long press and two clicks and you are back to swype
1403 if you only need the backtick for when youre entering code on stackexchange sites then theres actually no reason to type the character any time youre in question or answer box theres set of icons just above the box pressing the button puts pair of matching backticks into the text box at the current cursor location with some replacable text in between now just type over that text with swype or paste over works perfectly on my galaxy with swype enabled edit for more recent versions of swype see miquelfires answer where the backtick is now available as an extended character on the key beside the space bar
1407 there is also missing sync for android to sync your itunes playlists and associated files to your phone it works pretty well
1427 am long time user of locale and fairly new user of tasker find both to be very helpful tools in managing my device automatically use locale for all gps related tasks vibrate when at work between work hours silent when at home between sleeping hours when first installed tasker ported over these profiles and found that my battery life was decreased dramatically no matter how tweaked the polling settings tasker is more of action response application in my setup when placed in the car dock tasker autokills the car home application enables bluetooth and launches google navigation when headphones are plugged in launch the cubed music player disable vibration on all notifications when the computer usb cable is plugged in dont mind running both or having paid for both but was disappointed in that couldnt accomplish everything in tasker the dual setup gives me at least more battery life than running tasker alone if you do choose tasker be sure to experiment with the polling frequency of gps and network based location that also helps vary the battery usage dramatically
1433 that is great question went looking for that functionality back in the spring but only found apps that would let you print to wifi enabled printers just looked again and came across printershare which looks pretty cool apparently you can print to wifi printer or with software installed on local pc you can print over the internet to the attached printer havent had chance to try it out yet and it looks little pricey but seems promising
1459 since my original question was about an ssh binary and there is an answer for that ill accept that answer however there is another way to do what wanted to do kinda that might be interesting to someone some day tasker connectbot can be used to execute arbitrary remote or local guess but locale execute is better for that commands on schedule step set up your connection in connectbot you can have duplicate connections in connectbot as long as they have different aliases you have to rename one first away from user host in order to create the second long press and select edit host to perform these changes you probably want to set up an ssh key without password so that you can use this for automation once the connection actually works you can use post login automation to add the remote commands you would like to run make sure there is blank line at the end so that enter is sent after your last command use enter or to separate commands suggest using something like echo hello as test until you are sure things are working and exit at the end if you dont want to leave the connection open test this in isolation step create tasker task to call connectbot create new task in tasker add an action from misc select action intent the fields are action android intent action view cat default data ssh url in the form of ssh user host alias without the quotes the alias user and host here must match the alias you set up in step target activity click test connectbot should open and your commands should execute on the remote host step use this task in tasker however you would normally

1470 if you are already using locale which is not free astrid is free task todo list manager which can be configured to open list of tasks with specific tag astrid also integrates with remember the milk you can configure the list to open by various locale conditions including location use it to remind me of maintenance tasks when im near the hardware store additionally remember the milk is free app which can trigger by location but it does require pro subscription to remember the milks website
1473 for locale both gps and wifi triggers can drain the battery more quickly locales built in location condition can consider cell towers without gps if you set the diameter of the location condition to about 2km there is also locale condition plugin location energy saving which uses cell towers to determine location it takes advantage of the fact that the phone is already listening for towers the biggest potential drawback for using the energy saving location is when you are in an area dense with cell towers like major urban downtown with lots of tall buildings especially if you work higher up where lots of towers are visible to the phone
1505 think not least not efficiently if you want to do that you need servers big servers so you need big company to run thoses big servers so would be very surprised if that big company doesnt advertise for its product as opera did
1541 in the us at least most editions of the galaxy are shipped with quick office pretty functional document viewer that includes word pdf support its basic but works beyond that quite few 3rd party apps are available on the market including adobe reader amazon kindle barnes noble nook and handful of readers supporting non drmed formats like txt and epub
1548 android doesnt have any preloaded ebook readers but specific phones may have something preloaded the pre loaded apps depend on the carrier but regardless you can download different ebook readers from the android app market for free unfortunately none of the current ebook readers are complete solution as they all have major limitations here are the main players free non proprietary free app free books aldiko supports epubs with and without adobe drm there are thousands of these books available aldiko also has an included store selling commercial drm protected books great user interface aldiko also has paid app that has more features there are bunch more that do the open source books in the app market but none hold candle to aldiko proprietary these are all free apps but in most cases you have to buy the books ereader only reads pdb files and you have to sideload the app there area several book stores that sell books in this format including ereader com and fictionwise but these books are usually twice as much as kindle or nook books barnes noble used to sell pdb ebooks but swicthed to drmd epub this has got great powerful and easy ui and used to be my favorite when could get books from but now it is useless to me nook reads open epubs and drmd epubs you buy from barnes noble the ui needs lot of work compared to ereader and aldiko just abandoned this for the kindle app kindle this one comes pre loaded on the mobile galaxy reads drmd azw ebooks you buy from amazon this is now my ereader of choice kobo reads ebooks from kobo com havent bothered with this since the nook came out it used to be able to read borders com books but dont know anymore the old version of the app didnt allow for offline reading but they might have fixed that most of the major proprietary readers nook kindle kobo all have about the same selection of new release books at the same price about per book expect these apps to get lot better in the future its just very frustrating that used to be able to use much more robust and user friendly app ereader with new books but now have had to downgrade to the nook but to answer you question got off on tangent there sorry if you get the galaxy from mobile youll have kindle pre loaded but even if nothings pre loaded you can download all or any of the above mentioned apps for free from the android market except ereader which you have to sideload update amazon just recently updated their kindle app with few key features that came to love in ereader that make it nook killer in my book ability to highlight text and make notes ability to long click on word and look it up at dictionary com or wikipedia im switching to the kindle app now although im annoyed that just bought two nook books
1576 its worth noting that you dont have to use the market protocol you can swap in http market android com instead of market eg these two links should have the same effect http market android com detailsid de schildbach oeffi market detailsid de schildbach oeffi unfortunately this currently isnt quite as useful as it could be since non android browser will just get from the http link but imagine if google wanted to they could give you useful page instead see the publishing your applications page in the android developer guide for more details
1602 users can update several apps at once using android version an answer in the android support forum says they have added this already but this is probably limited to market client app on android aka froyo and higher firmware also dont see anything in the market would bring this out for pre phones but it could be out there
1604 use appbrain it automates the install procedure bit
1608 there is no official google talk voice video chat for android phones you can use google talk in android to make video chats now additionally any calls made via google voice are done via cell tower using your minutes not data
1621 there are apps out there now that should make it easier to use google docs on your phone but an official app will be out soon according to cnet news google docs coming to ipad android
1627 yah there is terrific one called maverick lite off road gps navigator with osm google and bing maps support for offline maps multi touch build in compass timer and trip computer share your current or planned location record and upload tracks to gpsies com foursquare support and its free the paid version costs about
1640 you should also be able to add lock pattern that makes it slightly more difficult to open the phone
1643 no for the same reasons detailed in this answer can hide program from ongoing activities in the notification bar
1652 there are quite few that use openstreetmap data this is review of mapdroyd and bigplanet and the openstreetmap wiki has comparison of android clients look in the first column and look for online offline
1700 yes it is possible to record phone calls using google voice but only calls that you receive
1701 still havent tried voice choice but just downloaded this free app voice plus this looks perfect from the description allows you to set rules for which number dialed will use your google voice number specify rules based on area code or by contacts using contact groups no more annoyance of having to press another button when dialing to choose where to call from
1716 alarm clock plus v2 its free in the app market lets you set song or playlist plus it has ton of other options its really killer app update still have the free ad supported version alarm clock plus installed on my phone but it looks like its gone from the market the only one left is the paid ad free version
1722 there are couple of apps to try use ultimate voice recorder which costs but works beautifully you can start recording in the middle of call quick search on appbrain brought up record my call which is free havent used record my call so cant comment on whether or not it can start in the middle of call update ultimate voice recorder does record both sides of the conversation
1725 gentle alarm seems little complex at first with profiles and alarms but it rocks the best feature is the one that allows you to skip alarms set to go off without actually turning off configured alarm use that feature all the time you have to pay for it but its worth it there was comment about the concern of gentle alarms internet usage below is what found on the devs forum need internet access to allow users to send me information if they choose so unfortunately there are no conditional permissions so even if you always decide not to send me any information when crash happens still need the permission there are two more reasons for internet permission if you paid via paypal you have to enter key to unlock the app this key is checked at some point when you are online every months and for market users such as system is coming google recently added licensing scheme as minor step against piracy and you will start seeing this used in more and more apps the app needs to call google servers to check if the license is valid results are cached so that the app also works if online for extended periods of time the latter two reasons are unfortunate but for every legal copy sell there are more than illegal ones out there there are even some people who bundle apps and sell them at discount piracy has gone out of hand and if developers dont earn money with their apps there will be fewer quality apps in the future will gladly discuss any concerns you may have
1728 fox to phone is firefox extension that lets your phone to chrome app talk to firefox
1729 one great way to send links from your pc to your phone when using chrome is the google chrome to phone extension once youre on the page you want you click the chrome to phone link in chrome and link to the page appears in the notification bar on your phone and you must be signed in to google find it very useful
1739 do not do this you are actually harming the lifespan of your battery when fully discharging it before recharge see this site for discussion of how depth of discharge affects battery life the only reason you might want to fully discharge before recharge is if you have nicad battery that is susceptible to the memory effect your smartphone most likely uses lithium ion polymer battery so there is no good reason for you to totally discharge your battery the lifetime is longer if you have shallow depth of discharge
1746 unfortunately there is no way to create these links in the google maps app
1747 have not been able to find out how to do that either however have found you can share places by clicking on them and then selecting share this place
1754 some options coco dolphin opera mini skyfire heres quick read on androidapps org that gives overviews on some of the more popular browsers and longer one from pc world personally just use the stock android browser ive used dolphin hd for while but at times it felt slow on my droid the opera mini browser is supposed to be pretty quick at loading pages because it will transfer your requests through operas servers first so that they can compress the content and send it back to you right now im waiting for the release of fennec by mozilla which will hopefully be amazing
1762 your phone has to be rooted if it is just search screenshot in the market for many options for an unrooted phone you can use dolphin browser hd with an addon to get screen captures of website
1764 install the android sdk on your computer connect the phone and run ddms from the terminal and then select device screen capture or ctrl and screenshot will be made
1765 in the galaxy froyo android you can take screenshots by holding the back key and tapping the home button
1769 an alpha version of fennec essentially firefox mobile was released recently
1770 tasker can do this for you no problems in fact its listed on the home page as particular use case make automatic recordings of what you say during phone calls to sd card
1772 once rooted ive liked working with screenshot cyrket link set the timer go to your application and wait or set it to shake mode go to your application and shake it hard and files show up in screenshot folder happy day mean it shake it hard unless theres some trick to shaking and im doing it in the wrong direction this is not sensitive shaker update yeah im using the timer option either the incredible has lousy shake sensor the app is implementing it weirdly or something else but shaking was just ridiculous would have been nice interface if that worked variable timer to take screenshots works just fine
1773 if you have android or higher you can press the power button the volume down button at the same time to take screenshot it will be saved to your gallery note you need to keep the buttons pressed for around second for this to work this is to avoid the screenshot when this combination is accidentally pressed if you have an android lower than if youre rooted you can install an app called drocap2 this will let you shake your phone wait on timer or click on notification in your notification bar to take screenshot and itll save it to your phone if youre not rooted you can not run screenshot app on your phone period youll have to install the android sdk on your computer connect you phone via usb and run program called ddms this program is mainly used for developer debugging but it has screenshot utility under one of its menus for tutorial see this page also some constructor like samsung have implemented this function on their phones the buttons combination change from phone to phone so search for yours
1785 if you have google voice you could send sms that way if not you could try out desktopsms an app that runs on the phone and client app on your computer that app is available on the market and then you can download the pc client from that site
1786 pdanet tethering program will let you send and receive sms via little desktop client when you are connected to your phone via usb or bluetooth update as of may pdanet apparently no longer offers its sms agent in its latest version
1797 dont see firefox extension that bring bookmarks to your phone permanently there are few suggestions in this question but they are designed more for sending links on one time basis getting the del icio us firefox add on and the del icio us add on for the android dolphin browser might be the best bet knew saw this somewhere on here props to this answer which mentions del icio us for android
1798 believe fennec firefox mobile will have this feature but it is currently only in alpha you can get copy of the alpha here note that youll need about 40mb of internal storage space free to install it
1811 the problem with something like this is its really hard to keep up somethings are easily seen as bad but others are harder to judge would you black list twitter client that has access to your location thats feature since people can attach their location to their tweets its not one use but its one some people do what about note taking app that has location and camera access is there any use case at all for something like that needing your location or the camera you would need to create standard for whats not acceptable and what is the sad corollary is do people installing apps really pay attention to what permissions their applications want
1815 google have removed apps from the market in the past for security related reasons but this doesnt normally remove them from devices when theyre already installed and there was also case few months ago when there was particularly misleading software that google removed from the market and also forcibly removed from peoples phones however all of this only protects you if you get your app from the standard android market if you use an alternative market or side load the app then youre on your own dont believe that theres an in the os blacklist to block malware its all handled at the market level androidguys com android team employs remote application removal android developers blog exercising our remote application removal feature
1822 theres really good thread of discussion about this on androidforums here in short leds have long life span 20k hours so the concern isnt really the leds burning out although after long period of time they will eventually start losing the amount of output and their brightness will dim the real concern is to not apply too much voltage to the led and overheat it another concern would be overheating your battery due to heat dissipation from draining the battery from powering the led in short if youre only using the led for time periods less than half an hour you should be okay if you need to use it longer go get real flash light
1824 leds do have long lifespan 35k 50k hrs depending on the type of led but the issue is heat the leds are intended to be used as flash ultra short duration and probably dont have very robust heat managment systems if they have any at all each phone is going to be different would say that using it as flashlight for couple minutes tops is fine but beyond that you run the risk of overheating which depending on the type of led and where its positioned in the phone in relation to other hardware could damage the led and possibly other components
1842 set up new gmail account you have to have one associated with the phone next on your phone go to settings applications manage applications gmail and choose clear all data do this for gtalk and google voice too if you have them set up this should prompt you to start the account setup on the phone where youll enter your new gmail acct info
1858 the built in camera app on the galaxy can use the front facing camera its called self shot mode and ive used it on mine once or twice easiest way to grab quick picture of you and friend when theres no one else around to take the shot open the camera app press the square symbol at the top left the mode button press self shot smile at the funny person on the screen update november as an update the official samsung froyo release has changed the way this works there is new icon in the top left of the camera screen that looks like camera with rotating arrows around it pressing this button swaps between the front and rear cameras picture of the new button to swap between cameras see this table for list of which galaxy models have the front facing camera and other differences between the models in the range
1910 try silent boot from the android market it automatically mutes your phone when you shutdown
1912 in system sound and display system volume you can set it unfortunately the power on off sound is also tied to the touch feedback sound ie you press button hear sound if thats not problem turn it all the way down and problem solved
1943 well at least ive been using the front facing camera for video phone calls seems to work well enough between samsung galaxy phones havent tested with other phones yet
1944 wrote an app that uses the front facing camera of the evo and epic it is silly but its free check out realmirror
1955 go the to myinfo tab and set your status to sign out once youre signed out the back button works as expected and exits skype edit as of v2 at least skype has simplified the log out mechanism in the home screen of skype simply do this
1965 the google charts api is definitely the easiest you just make url as follows https chart apis google com chartchs 150x150 cht qr chl content choe utf content is usually link for example this is link to this site https chart apis google com chartchs 150x150 cht qr chl https android stackexchange com choe utf
1966 using the goo gl url shortener http goo gl a4wv and adding qr to the end of it http goo gl a4wv qr
1968 this question seems to say that its necessary to root an at phone like the samsung captivate in order to install apps from unofficial sources that is not true while you cannot download apps from the web you can install apps through the development tools or things based on the development tools like the sideloader wonder machine my question is bit more focused if im working on my own android app will be able to load it on my at phone for testing via the android sdk etc without first rooting the phone yes
1973 leave it off so that can review the list of pending updates and see what changed of course that only helps for the apps that list changes in the market description every once in while developers do release updates that are step backwards either because of introducing bugs or major redesigns that lose features astrid im looking at you if you wait long enough before updating then you may be alerted to that situation via comments
1974 the main reason why wont use the feature is traffic in germany we have mostly traffic limitated flatrates so after or mb of traffic or something like that youll be forced to only use 2g connections for the rest of the month because of that limitations only update my apps when have wifi access somewhere around me
1987 sometimes developer might release controversial update interface changed ads added or lot of bugs were introduced and therefore you may want to hold off before upgrading or at least give yourself chance to back up the apk good example of this recently was psx4droid
1988 you can also make ascii qr codes mainly for websites like reddit http asciiqr com
1989 the android compatibility definition document direct pdf says that device implementations must support the android developer tools provided in the android sdk any device which isnt compatible with android according to this document isnt going to have the google services and in particular would not have the google play store such devices do exist but if you have one youd likely know it lack of official compatibility doesnt mean you cant use the standard development tools either just that theyre not obligated to allow it the amazon kindle fire is an example of such device
1998 also you might want not to update apps automatically if you have old cheap device on my htc hero installing apps kind of takes lot of resources and dont want the device to slow down randomly
2008 open up the memo application or anywhere that you can enter text enter the ki thats giving you problems highlight it and hit the swype key on the lower left it will prompt you to delete the word in general it will remember new words that you enter you may have to type them out letter by letter first
2010 everyone offers plenty of good reasons not to auto update so ill offer solution use good backup app such as titanium backup and you can safely leave autoupdates on and manually revert to an older version if an app changes in ways you arent happy with
2014 good question dont see an obvious way to do that to solve your problem on all websites however there just so happens to be few xkcd viewer apps use this one which has menu hover text option edit this seems like reasonable thing to try for link hover text but it does not work for me on the default htc incredible browser tap any white empty space near to the link you want to hover over now move your trackball up down until it selects the link don click it there the tooltip now appears simple solution saw this suggested here
2017 go to settings application settings manage application then tap on the app itll say the version you are running under the name you shouldnt have to check though if the app in the market doesnt say installed then you dont have the most recent version
2021 capitalizing in swype is pretty easy if wanted to swype joe would hit the and then swype to point above the keyboard on the screen then back down to and if wanted to do joe would swype from to point above the keyboard then do little loop while still above the keyboard then swype to and so in order to get capital hit the letter and the sweep up above the keyboard and then let go
2029 from the home screen go to settings accounts sync your account and make sure that sync gmail is checked
2030 sounds like youre overthinking it android goes out of its way to intelligently manage applications and resources when you leave an app it will generally keep running as long as the resources are available long pressing home and selecting it or just launching the shortcut again should take you right back to the running app theoretically it shouldnt matter if it is still running or not though every app is supposed to save its state in such way that if the os kills it before you come back it should still be able to launch back to the same state you left it in this isnt universally applied in programs yet but it does seem to be much more widespread these days presumably because the developers are getting used to the android way
2033 the easiest way to compare these two apps locale costs more but it is lot more user friendly you just set up situations with triggers and actions then you prioritize the situations thats it tasker costs less but it is lot more customizable its more like being given scripting language there are tons of options and choices and it can get really confusing if you dont know what you are doing it is not made for the average user will say that anything locale can do tasker can do it too it just isnt as quick and easy to set it up in regards to backing up you can backup tasker into script files locale has no built in back up system both of these applications are extendable to do practically anything because they support plugins tasker supports locale plugins too also personally use both of these apps use locale for setting up common situations disable sounds when asleep adjust brightness screen timeout when plugged in go silent at work etc and then tasker for well tasks such as plugging in my headphones reduce my media volume to ive blared music accidentally way too many times and displaying menu of music apps
2035 the app smart taskbar will show you list of the all tasksapps that are currently running on your device and allow you to switch to that app similar to the native functionality but you are not limited to the most recent apps basically it opens from any screen and also lets you set some shortcuts and widgets and choose from all installed apps like the app drawer so you can complete any task from anywhere on your phone without having to go to the home screen first there are bunch of other apps that let you switch between running apps just search the market for task switcher
2050 make sure the charger outputs amp most vehicle chargers that arent specifically for smartphones or dont list output are going to be amp
2056 couldnt find way to do it or an app that would do it there were couple out there that claimed to have manual focus but basically just did what you described as assisted auto focus found this thread at xda where some people have been looking through the code to find way to add the manual focus from what they found it appears that it is possible but someone has to code it its worth keeping an eye on it http forum xda developers com showthread phpt
2075 im using an app called diskusage which helps visualize whats using both my internal storage as well as the sd card
2076 most of the apps you have listed are big because they are storing data the apps themselves are not that big would encourage people to check large apps you can sort by size in the manage applications area of the settings chances are you can clear out the data and reduce the amount of size very easily most of the data for those apps especially is email and data that are old and dont really need to be on your phone
2114 heres great article someone wrote on the effect of changing it very detailed http ryanolson wordpress com test how changing the max amount of memory per vm heap can effect your rom cyanogen in short with the g1 it can cause bigger applications to crash would just recommend you keep it default or find value that you do not see any crashes in applications with as far as anything else goes in the short period of time searching else where and reading over different posts could not personally find any other effects other than possibly battery life
2115 just had this problem and somehow got this solved what did entered settings applications manage applications selected the market app and uninstall updates after that entered the market app again and was able to reinstall the app who got stucked ps im not sure if this was just coincidence or this procedure works always but it worked for me ps2 my android version is actually in portuguese language so im not sure the option names referred to above are correct in english
2121 in answer to my own question and in thanks for the answer already provided but the problem was that in my office my phone uses wifi router which is connected to the internet via firewall and on this firewall one of the necessary imap ports was blocked my collegue changed this setting and now gmail is behaving as expected am really not in the habit of choosing my own answers as the selected answer but for this question this was the solution hope it helps others
2134 another option like lookout in addition to tracking finding your phone also does virus scanning and backs up data it doesnt display message though
2157 if you have rooted phone you can edit the default prop file to bring the no sound back to the shutter sound menu login to the shell using adb part of the android sdk then switch to super user mode adb shell su note depending on how your phone is rooted you may need to confirm that unknown application can become super user make sure your phone is unlocked and the screen visible before typing su then accept this when prompted or it will just echo the commands out mount the system drive in read write mode and copy default prop to your sd card mount remountrw yaffs2 dev mtdblock2 system cp system default prop sdcard copy the file to your desktop used swiftp then change the line used notepad so the line endings werent mangled which reads ro camera sound forced to ro camera sound forced copy the file back to your sd card then cp sdcard default prop system exit the adb prompt ctrl reboot your phone when you next go into the camera app choose the settings menu and the no sound option should be available alternatively after mounding the system partition overwrite the shutter ogg by issuing the following commands cd system media audio camera cp sound0 no sound ogg sound3 shutter ogg kill the camera app if its already running start the camera app choose sound3 and then youll have silent shutter works on my mobile uk customised sony ericsson xperia x10i but should work on most all rooted android phones if you actually enable the no sound option not only does it disable the really loud camera shutter racket but it means when listening to music it no longer goes silent to allow the shutter sound to be played and it seems to take photos much faster changing the ogg files doesnt gain you these advantages thanks to zephyrixs hint at http forum xda developers com showthread phpt and for j4mm3rs note on how to make system writeable
2162 im using trillian for android as far as know its still in beta but worked well for me so far though didt use it in any extreme situations yet oh and it doesnt handle calls yet edit its out of beta and now you have to pay for it if you dont like that or dont have the money or you cant buy apps from the market like me you should use something else
2176 there are number of apps you can use but many will already have the es file manager note turn off as many apps as you can some apps will not backup while running launch es file manager when you open it you are normally in the file manager mode tap the second icon from the right to switch to application mode long press on any icon select select all from the context menu press menu select backup while the backup is running you can watch its progress by opening the notification bar the applications will be copied into backup apps
2181 update ive gotten pixelpipe to work with the stock camera app now every single picture take with my droids camera is automatically uploaded to picasa dropbox through pixelpip you can set it up to upload to any number of services heres how to get it set up go into pixelpipe go to settings turn on enable auto upload for camera and start uploads at once have also chosen to turn off prompts and warnings go into add or edit pipes and set up which ever service you want to auto upload to go into the settings for that pipe and make sure that the default for new uploads is send dont know if this actually has to be chosen dont think so but havent tested it just checked it off to be safe take picture and it will upload to the pipes you set up tried it with camera360 and it worked once but another time it didnt buggy dont know why pixelpipe will do that for you plus whole lot more basically you can set it to automatically upload any pic taken with the camera to almost any cloud service there is including picasa and dropbox you can also tell it to only use wifi
2201 the right answer is to just go to http xkcd com there is link on there to show or hide the alt text
2212 ive used picpush for this purpose it worked well only issue had was it occasionally pushing an already backed up picture second time and some random future date not that critical of an issue just wound up with few duplicate photos in my picasa account it supports many common photo services too but if you download just the free portion of the app you get day trial forget exactly to see if it works out for you http www appbrain com searchq picpush
2215 as far as know it moves as much of the app as it can from the internal storage to the sd card so for instance databases images or other resources would be moved over do not know the exact details of how it works
2217 like bryan says cant comment so had to add another answer it doesnt move the whole app the size given after the move is the bit still on the internal storage it doesnt give any size for the elements that have beend moved to sd so in answer to your question the app doesnt get smaller just amount of internal storage used gets smaller
2281 you might be interested in assisted gps assistance falls into two categories information used to more quickly acquire satellites it can supply orbital data or almanac for the gps satellites to the gps receiver enabling the gps receiver to lock to the satellites more rapidly in some cases the network can provide precise time the device captures snapshot of the gps signal with approximate time for the server to later process into position accurate surveyed coordinates for the cell site towers allow better knowledge of local ionospheric conditions and other conditions affecting the gps signal than the gps receiver alone enabling more precise calculation of position see also wide area augmentation system and cellhunter calculation of position by the server using information from the gps receiver the assistance server has good satellite signal and plentiful computation power so it can compare fragmentary signals relayed to it by gps receivers with the satellite signal it receives directly and then inform the gps receiver or emergency services of the gps receivers position many mobile phones combine gps and other location services including wi fi positioning system and cell site triangulation and sometimes hybrid positioning system
2301 if im not mistaken it is to access googles presumably large wireless mac address location database which like skyhook competing service also previously used on ios devices allows handset to scan for wireless networks nearby and send their mac addresses possibly ssids as well havent looked into it too depply off to google to compare to their database and fire back an approximate location based on their data collection which you consent to help provide by enabling this feature to the answerer mentioning gps think the op was already using gps and using google maps over 3g connection but had wi fi disabled believe this technique is achieved similarly with the use of cell towers measuring the signal strength between the connected and neighbouring towers and comparing it to stored database such as ofcoms attempt available in the uk location area code lac and cell id cid for anyone curious you can find these on most android phones using the code in your dialer although for whatever reason its encoded in hex so just convert it back to decimal if you like tl dr triangulate your location quicker using wi fi signals while your gps gets satellite lock gps serves the same purpose but achieves this using different method secure user plane location think if anyone wants to read up on it
2315 this timely post from lifehacker may help were you the one who emailed them what should do when my android runs out of app space heres the summary in order of easy to hard move bigger apps to sd storage currently requires froyo navigate to settings applications manage applications or something similar view the all tab sort by size you cant do anything about the big hitters namely gmail browser and maps will always be pretty big clear the cache and maybe data on some apps similar to navigate to settings applications clear out apps you dont actually use shouldnt this be android set your sd card as the default installation location lifehacker points to the androinica blog how to here root your phone and set up apps2sd disclaimer rooting may not be fun for non geeks lifehacker how to root and custom firmware cyanogenmod also supplied by lifehacker of course some of the comments on the post are helpful as well hope it helps
2319 it may be time for you to start removing old applications that you no longer use or dont use very frequently youve already moved your apps to the sd card and cleared your caches there isnt much more you can do
2333 dont think there will be much benefit with swapping for android as the android application life cycle is much more advanced form of swapping will there be many not oftenly used memory pages to swap out especially in os and those un killable services you cant swap the os kernel even in desktop linux and android already kills services when it needs more ram if your device vendor persists that you have to have useless services running all the time then root your device how will swapping out small memory pages hurt flash memory life span does the flash or sd card do wear leveling automatically even if the sd card does wear leveling swapping will hurt quite lot will swapping really help performance when running multiple apps assume if the answer to is yes it will not in the context of android unlike traditional os that will keep trying to chug in processes as you requested it android will force kill older unused processes and reclaims their memory this killing is fast as applications will already save their state when you task switch will writing to flash be too slow and thus hurt responsiveness when swapping happens probably probably not will need benchmarks for that is it true that android keeps the swapping mechanism from the linux kernel so as long as there is swapping partition file it will do swapping without extra configuration dont know whether android keeps the swapping mechanism but even if it does or if you compile your own kernel you will still need some configurations its usually just having an fstab file that points to the swap file and doing swapon in fact have reasons why swapping may actually hurt performance it prevents application life cycle androids memory management scheme to work correctly
2334 you can use an app like diskusage to see which applications are taken up the most memory on the internal storage clearing the cached data stored by app from application screen in settings is also way of freeing up space temporary
2340 there is definitely benefit to swapping despite what everyone else on the internet will tell you try it and see for yourself empirically on g1 or other phone with low memory swap makes the phone run better and faster yes android has life cycle task management built in but its not very good it routinely kills processes when it runs out of memory and the apps are expected to save their state using bundles so that when you restart them they restart in the same state they were last in once android determines that it needs to remove process it does this brutally simply force killing it the kernel can then immediately reclaim all resources needed by the process without relying on that application being well written and responsive to polite request to exit allowing the kernel to immediately reclaim application resources makes it lot easier to avoid serious out of memory situations this would be great if it actually worked and would be better than indiscriminate swap but the apps dont really save their state they just save the minimal amount of information to get back to that state and some apps dont even bother to do this getting back to that state takes time since swap actually saves the entire state of the app which just has to be reloaded it makes switching between apps much faster if you switch to another app from the browser for instance the browser almost always gets killed and then it has to reload the entire page from the internet when you switch back to it this takes wayyyy longer than reloading the state from swap wastes your money if youre on data plan and causes state problems when the web page is dynamic many apps take much longer to start up than they should or dont actually return to the same state when theyre restarted so swapping them out works better im guessing the people who are happy with the stock system use their phones differently should use swap partition with cyanogenmod
2378 now you can use bit ly to create qr code by adding qrcode to the end of bit ly link for example turn this http bit ly 9ursmt into this http bit ly 9ursmt qrcode and you get this
2380 dont know if what you propose is under consideration it would be nice your summary of how it all works sounds accurate handle the transition by sending new message from whatever new location im continuing the conversation in to manually force it to redirect as you say you wont get the history but its the simplest method
2410 the broadcom bcm4329 chipset in lot of android phones nexus one evo g1 probably many more supports monitor promiscuous mode the driver needs to be modified to allow monitor mode to be enabled here is the source of the current drivers monitor mode flag method to that sets the mode in the second link you can see that monitor mode flag is not even in the switch statement so its just gets ignored when called someone also got tcpdump working on g1 so its possible we jsut need to put in some work to get it functional though few more links about the chipset drivers and modifications to them http forum aircrack ng org index phptopic http aircrack ng org doku phpid b43 http wireless kernel org en users drivers b43
2420 to provide some background on this question google talk uses xmpp aka jabber which is an open instant messaging standard as part of this standard every instant messaging client chat in gmail and the android talk app is assigned resource the server then uses the resource to know which client is communicating this is how the interaction works say your gmail account is bob gmail com then gmail chat might be bob gmail com gchat and the talk app bob gmail com talk when your friend sue sue gmail com wants to send you message she simply sends it to bob gmail com at this point the server either sends the message to whichever client you used last or sends the message to all currently connected clients google does the latter when you reply to sue using the talk app she receives the message from bob gmail com talk now instead of sending further messages to bob gmail com sues client now sends messages directly to bob gmail com talk and will continue doing so until message is received from some other client this means that what saiboogu said should work that is to switch between clients send message to the person you are chatting with from the desired client tl dr this happens by design saiboogus workaround works
2421 method similar to the one that matt mentions worked in pre versions of android all you had to do was hit the clear data button for the google apps application in settings applications manage applications since and the improvements to account management that came with it this trick no longer works to the best of my knowledge g2 mytouch slide and g1 with cyanogenmod master reset is now required if you need to backup info try searching appbrain com for share my apps sms backup or sms backup and restore and or mybackup pro
2433 angry birds data would be stored inside the phones memory under the folder data access to that folder is not permitted to you or any app for security reasons without having root access there is no way to access that folder or backup your app however once youve obtained root access you could either extract the data yourself or use an application like titanium backup
2440 great question heres an answer for someone with two g1s as seen here have g1s and only one sim card have put the sim card in each and wiped even with different esn numbers they both sign in to google flawlessly and the paid apps are associated with the gmail sign in so they show up on both phones so accordingly it seems that paid apps are synced with the gmail account this makes sense from ownership standpoint paying for given app grants access on multiple devices however it may not make sense for some specific apps gps location etc
2441 thats true its no problem to use multiple phones with one account do it like this myself with g1 and galaxy the paid apps are connected to your gmail account so you can use them on any phone with your credentials otherwise you would have to pay with every new phone you are going to buy
2444 have motorola droid running cm6 android effectively and g1 running cm5 android effectively the droid is on verizon and the g1 is on pre pay sim card with no data so it is basically wifi device use for dev testing use the same google account on both it does not force me to have the same apps on both phones can download apps have paid for on both phones without any problems contacts gmail etc sync just fine however do believe that if both devices are running froyo it will try to initially restore your apps when you add your google account but believe you can then uninstall them it wont try to re install again
2458 google code seems to be the predominant place for open source android apps http code google com hosting searchq label android
2467 highly recommend sms backup or its forked version sms backup itll back up your sms to gmail label automatically backup sms mms and call log entries using separate label in gmail google calendar it is also possible to restore sms and call log entries back to the phone mms not supported yet
2491 recommend life saver by tim bray it saves and restores not only sms but also your phone call history lifesaver helps you move phone sms history from one android device to another your phone call log and sms messages are your life history you shouldn lose them just because you get new phone lifesaver2 which replaces the old lifesaver is here to help
2495 note that having the gps enabled doesnt unlike with bluetooth drain the battery the gps only uses battery when its active which only happens when something is trying to use it dont know of any app that can enable gps if its disabled for the message however your best solution currently is probably wavesecure
2502 you dont mention which phone or android version youre using on my motorola droid android the built in mail application allows me to connect to my employers exchange server when created the account had three options for connecting pop3 imap and exchange there are other mail clients out there that may also connect to exchange
2503 try prey for android some features to trigger it you send an sms with specific text default go prey once triggered starts recording its location to display on your prey dashboard if missing you can put text messages on the screen or cause loud alarm to be played heres recent review http www downloadsquad com prey for android is an open source anti theft service
2523 you could try k9 mail use it for non exchange accounts and it works great so know its great email app in general believe it has the ability to connect to exchange servers too so there you go
2529 you can use sms backup restore to export to an xml file schedule automatic backups or backup your messages anytime you wish you can view backup contents on your phone and choose to backup selected conversations only backups are created in xml format and saved to your devices sd card the xml can then be converted to other formats and can also be viewed on computer its easy to mail your backup files anywhere you wish
2539 believe its no to both those questions yes you can clear default associations only if you know which app is associated with with intent you will still be prompted with the dialog asking you which app youd like to use with the current intent apart from that there is no way to clear associations they are hard coded inside each app there is no way to remove them update to answer your edited question head to settings applications manage applications find your application that you chose as your default app for that intent click clear defaults
2541 you can remove some intent associations by going to the specific app that you specified the intent for in the settings applications manager applications find your app clear defaults button there is no way to view all associations given from intents to apps
2570 what do you mean by delete it exactly your phone needs to be linked to google account no matter what as far as know if you do wish to change the main google account your phone is linked with factory reset is the way ive had to do it myself few times if you just want to stop receiving gmail notifications go into settings accounts and uncheck the sync option for the account you no longer wish to have gmail sync with
2576 there are ways to do it without factory reset however depending upon the phone it may not work without being linked with google account im not sure about the hero one way or the other see here another option is that you could just create dummy google account then never use it
2577 it is up to the manufacturer of the device to provide the appropriate and functional drivers for any hardware on their device unfortunately many of them also like to add their own ui often poorly designed and implemented this is the case with the tapui from all ive heard this is not problem with android its problem with viewsonic
2580 basically you have to compile android for that device with its drivers example of compilation process an older example from the official dev site for building for the g1 devices like the n1 and g1 dev phones let you easily put these images on your phone after compilation because that is what they were made for unlockable and hackable believe their drivers are in the official android source could be wrong but they are easily available all other devices dont come unlocked so first you have to unlock root your phone to be able to write anything else to it ive never compiled android or rom so cant give you much more details than this essentially there are proprietary binaries the drivers that are also needed for each specific android phone in order to get it to run on that device so you either have to get those drivers from the vendor or write them yourself
2582 barcode generator reader is an app that reads and decodes qr codes from file also you can bookmark this web based reader zxing decoder online then when you come across qr code long press on it copy the image url then paste it into the linked page
2604 four come to mind phoning pigeon wheres my droid lookout mobile prey each goes about it in different ways phoning pigeon probably has the lightest touch you pre define one or more phone numbers with the app then if the phone receives two consecutive calls from one of those numbers it will turn the ringer on at maximum volume wheres my droid is similar but you send an sms message with specific text the lookout siren is very loud youd have no trouble finding it the app has several other functions as well including virus scanning and backing up your data prey is similar to lookouts tracking and probably wouldnt be as useful for finding misplaced phone in your house its more for tracking phone that has been taken it might work for you though and theres no risk in checking it out
2606 upnplay is an alpha release and apparently still bit glitchy but still some positive reviews
2632 use the phone function of your wifes phone to erm phone it
2651 more often than not digital consider how in the world would the motor for moving lens fit in phone case for that matter where would the find the room to have variable focal length would the manufacturers really put such battery drainer in the unit how much more expensive would it be too should somebody actually come up with phone with optical zoom it would be big deal and huge marketing gimmick the only phone camera with optical zoom havent seen any have you thats not to say that someday someone wont make hasnt made such phone there sure arent any right now unless they make big deal about the camera zoom you can assume its digital
2652 al everett has suggested that no android camera has optical zoom but the megapixel altek leo android seems to have 3x optical zoom not digital like other cellphones the altek leo wont be available until at least though
2656 the best way to tell if it is digital or optical do the pixels look blown up and therefore blurry
2671 going through the galaxy flash root adb rom guide on xda just spotted this im running linux osx can still flash my firmware do need to install windows if you are running linux you do not need to install windows you can either run odin in virtual machine or alternatively use heimdall by benjamin dobell heimdall runs natively on linux and has reached well tested release state which takes us to here heimdall cross platform open source flashing software what is heimdall heimdall is cross platform open source utility to flash roms onto samsung galaxy phones how does it work heimdall uses the same protocol as odin to interact with device in download mode usb communication in heimdall is handled by the popular open source usb library libusb what platforms does heimdall run on linux os and windows xp vista etc what galaxy variants has heimdall been tested with ive tested heimdall with galaxy gt i9000 gb from the united kingdom and galaxy gt i9000 gb from australia dont have access to any other devices to test with at present but community members have confirmed it to also function correctly for the at captivate hopefully this will help us all out though obviously as this is effectively replacement for samsungs odin software its more designed towards people who are happy grabbing their roms from various places across the internet and flashing them on in fairly custom way as opposed to kies which is supposed to be pretty much plug and play
2725 if was buying used device would expect that factory reset would have been done to it either way id probably do factory reset myself anyway just because unless of course rather wanted rooted phone think factory reset is the better option you wouldnt want someone to stumble upon some of your personal data in any event its best to make sure the buyer knows exactly what theyre getting
2727 would keep the phone rooted with the sale option of restoring to stock rom if thats what the customer wants or you can give the phone back with stock rom with root clockwork should let you do that make sure you factory reset the phone before you give it to them rooted or not and format the sd card too

2788 there is dearth of official apps for googles own services on googles own mobile os no official google reader app no official widget that may be because they work on optimizing the mobile versions of those web services to obviate the need for an additional app youve already got the browser why install an app for web service this article on how greader renders in mobile webkit might explain some of the concept
2848 if youre using swype simply drag from the swype key to where the is swype will change to the numeric keypad
2849 do you use any task killer make sure you dont kill the clock apps in fact dont use task killer at all theyre harmful to android
2875 enable your gps and use navigator to some location you are not going to that is far away then watch movie on your phone with brightness on max this will get the job done
2876 there is an free app sgs tools on the market which gives you all the collection of commands
2886 yes the phone has to remain switched on for the alarm to work
2908 you dont need to by default android will automatically terminate applications that havent been used for long time when another application needs the used memory android prolongs the life of applications so that when you return to the applications it will already be in the memory this improves responsiveness but applications whose life is prolonged in such manner will be force killed if another foreground application needs memory
2909 the people over at xda developers com will tell you you dont need task killer why well you see ram only uses up energy when you change whats in it so actually the act of cleaning up costs you more than keeping it in memory the only apps would recommend closing are those that require internet access and or sync often this includes various games social networks and your email update would add gps apps to the list of ones you want to keep an eye on although these generally have explicit exit options and so dont require killing either for the rest its best to let froyo decide for you
2921 from what can find there is no way to turn it off no solution in the samsung galaxy forum no solution in the vodafone forum tasker cant suppress it however one commenter notes some custom roms rebuild the framework and rip the notification out entirely check out the xda forums if youd like to try that stuff typically requires root and good working knowledge of how to use clockwork recovery odin etc not for the faint of heart

2953 yes you can even without root by using adb ddms and droidex see http answers oreilly com topic how to capture video of the screen on android the basic idea is to use ddms to capture screenshot rapidly and then composing these screenshots into videos havent actually tried this yet so dont know how well it works or whether it works doubt this can be done practically purely in device side problem being that video is extremely memory heavy without compression and compressing video in real time will be torture to even the latest phones cpu

2970 just clear the text of the draft message and it will automatically disappear
2976 not dev but heres my best stab at an explanation as understand it assuming ive understood your question hopefully im not too far off the mark all the rooted roms have used manage root access user the superuser application when you start an app that wants to run with superuser privileges the superuser application will prompt the user to grant the root application these permissions the superuser application then maintains white list of apps that have been granted these permissions this is the same for console emulators etc so you grant access to the console application you dont need to enter password within the emulator dont think you need to worry about the root password for this with regards to hidden apis dont think they are hidden as such as the android os is open sourced in the first place
2988 the easy way is to go to your wifi settings and hit menu advanced itll show up there or you can set it to static ip if you want the cool way is to dial to open the testing menu then click wifi information then wifi status

3000 all newer phones use lithium polymer batteries why is it partially charged to decrease their aging they are intended to be stored at charge this means when you receive your phone it should be at charge otherwise they will have aged your battery for you you are probably used to the effects of aging like year old phone seeming to have very short battery life when you get your phone you can use it until it is discharged but they normally say charge it because people will not notice the partial charge do not fully discharge you should not fully worry about fully discharging this is superstition to earlier battery technologies fully discharging lithium battery is one of the best ways to make it fail below certain charge they will have their overcharge protection circuitry fail and you cannot charge it at all have seen studies that show that this makes up more than of failed lithium batteries lithium battery aging lithium batteries have set number of charge discharge cycles before they fail this might be number like cycles you actually get more like cycles if you only discharge to before recharge lithiums really do not like deep discharge cannot stress this enough if you would like more information about lithium battery technology let me know can get you many links just drop me comment have few answers on the electronics and robotics stack exchange about it can leave it plugged in all the time yes and no this is very dependent on whom makes your device for example my lenovo laptop will not apply charge to the battery unless it is under when it does charge the battery it charges directly to then stops until the battery sags below many laptops did not do this on most just applying charge if it is not this would put the battery through thousands of charge cycles in week when you are not using the battery this ages battery quickly if your phone maker took the time and paid the extra cash then your phone will stop charging once it reaches full charge and just power the system from the wall outlet it is significantly more likely that your phone is charging your battery on short cycle and aging it thoroughly myths some people have some confusion from some of the myths that go about the primary one is memory as battery university will say this is mostly extinct and actually applies to nickel cadmium batteries as was stated in comment about crystals battery university has in reference to nickel cadmium with memory the crystals grow and conceal the active material from the electrolyte in advanced stages the sharp edges of the crystals penetrate the separator causing high self discharge or electrical short now talking about lithium batteries which your phone uses there is even more difference to quote them battery university directly from their simple guidelines avoid frequent full discharges because this puts additional strain on the battery several partial discharges with frequent recharges are better for lithium ion than one deep one recharging partially charged lithium ion does not cause harm because there is no memory in this respect lithium ion differs from nickel based batteries short battery life in laptop is mainly cause by heat rather than charge discharge patterns understand how this may go against what you have been taught but am someone who not only has researched this but uses lithium batteries in my day to day work as an engineer

3267 back up your data all of it internal and external sd memory connect your phone to your pc choosing the mass storage option first make it ask you before connect how to connect then walk through all of your applications checking for any folder named cache or anything similar then delete whatever is in it if you came across any other kind of file that is cache or related to cache delete it this issue happens because some most of them actually cache files have very long extension and that prevents the mtp connection establishment for me tried this in two ways the first one formatted my sd memory both internal and external and that didnt pay off then tried the method mentioned above and it worked if it didnt please reply telling so

3285 an alternative to garys method is to use set as you can open the gallery app select photo and then pick menu more set as contact icon you can then choose the contact to apply it to the set as option is sometimes available from other applications have media gallery app on my xt720 that has it
3301 widgets wont work if theyre on the sd card
3303 taken straight from android developer site there is no effect on the application performance so long as the external storage is mounted on the device the apk file is saved on the external storage but all private user data databases optimized dex files and extracted native code are saved on the internal device memory the unique container in which your application is stored is encrypted with randomly generated key that can be decrypted only by the device that originally installed it thus an application installed on an sd card works for only one device the user can move your application to the internal storage through the system settings also applications that should not install on external storage more details on android developer site services alarm services live wallpapers live folders app widgets account managers sync adapters device administrators broadcast receivers listening for boot completed
3304 applications installed on sd card cannot run if you remove your sd card or youre turning on usb mass storage so it can be accessed from computer thats the only drawback have been experiencing ive actually seen performance improvement since moving to sd before moved to sd had exhausted the internal memory about few kilobytes left and the phone lags quite badly since moving to sd and therefore freeing some space in the internal memory and the lag disappears
3309 use market applications like permission watchdog or permissions also there are several others
3325 root in linux or any unix like system is just the user with user id the su program which actually stands for switch user not super user is just program to start another program with different user id than the starting program by default to uid which is to user root android does not use the traditional etc passwd however it still uses linux user id and group id for managing permissions if you want to intercept su requests so you can ask for password or enforce other rules you will need to replace sbin su with your own version of su alternative approach is the one described here http www koushikdutta com fixing su security hole on modified html though that will require applications to cooperate by firing an intent when they want to switch user android security framework is more or less like this each installed application runs on its own user id selected at installation time and application permissions is implemented as user groups can change the root password after rooting my android device by simply typing passwd android does not use etc passwd so it also does not have passwd program how is the rooting process working mean what is the one click root apps doing to my phone im not quire sure with the exact process myself you probably want to ask to rooting developers however my guess is it just reverts the security check that originally prevent developer from setuid and im developer so how can find hidden apis like ios for rooted app development since android is open source there is no truly hidden api in android however there are some unpublicized or undocumented apis you can browse for this in androids source code however these apis are not about root developments theyre usually in development apis that are not ready yet or is too localized for specific purpose that is not useful for public developer or perhaps google just havent realized their usefulness yet you are not restricted from using these apis but since these are not an officially supported apis they may disappear or break backward compatibilities in the future if you need to use these apis make sure your app breaks gracefully
3336 as long as you have gps switched on on your phone on galaxy the easiest way to do this is from the buttons that appear when you pull the notification bar down from the top of the screen and have gps switched on in the camera you should see the satellite receiver gps icon appear and start flashing when you open the camera app as long as you see this then your phone is trying to geo tag your pictures be aware that even in the best of conditions your phone can take seconds or more to get decent gps position locked so wait bit after you open the camera app before you take the picture you can also speed up the gps lock by making sure that you have the assisted gps features switched on see this previous question for details on how to switch those features on
3341 you can install the application tasker and use it to always enable gps when the camera is launched enabling gps for apps that need it is one of the more common uses of tasker but it does so much more than that heres an article with information http lifehacker com how to turn your android phone into fully automated superphone
3365 go to samsung kies software on top left of the window click the menu driver recovery let it reinstall drivers after driver installation finished go to your phone settings application development tick usb debugging mode under usb debugging mode connect your phone to the pc with usb it installs correctly disconnect from pc untick usb debugging mode connect again and it works
3371 yes as you have guessed on devices that support automatic screen brightness there is light sensor its typically small hole on the side of the screen not all phones have light sensor for example samsung spica lacks one though you can use the power control widget to quickly change the brightness
3372 yes it uses the light sensor and yes most of the smartphones support it as for how does it work smartphones generally have light sensor located in the bezel right next to the screen that measures the ambient light together with control software that appropriately raises or lowers the screen brightness based on the measured light level if you are watching in the dark the screen should be appropriately dim when the ambient light level is higher the screen needs to be made appropriately brighter for two reasons because of glare from ambient light reflected off the screen which washes out the image and because the eyes light sensitivity decreases substantially as the ambient light level increases
3397 dont give them lower rating for one really look at the rating to see if program is worth investigating fine program just without the option to move to sd is not all of sudden bad program look at their web sites or at an email address visible in the market of in the program if none is found clearly specify it in the comments but do not give it worse reading at least thatt my opinion here
3404 if you want to provide feedback and or do have feature request that you want to have answered it would be best to write an email provided in the android market its located below the description and images of the app also you could check out the website if the developer does have bugtracker and or forum which is often the case
3408 considered giving them low rating in the market and writing in the comment that would give them stars if they included the move to sd card option please please please dont do this us developers hate it when we are threatened with ratings stars if you do usually when is the most random and obscure feature request often not related to the app the rating of an application should be based off its current quality if its missing feature that you think would be good for it or if you encounter bug then email the developer the problem with rating down an application that does not completely deserve it is that the user typically does not change their rating even if their threatened feature request was added additionally developers cannot respond directly to comments to make the user aware that they added the feature or fixed that bug if you email the developer then they will be able to contact you back in the case of move to sd card option it might not be recommended to do such thing for instance if an application has widgets it is not recommended to move to sd card see more examples and info here
3417 another app that ended up using instead of permissions is rl permissions prefer the interface as far as which one works better dont know
3421 pdanet claims to be able to do this other phones such as my sidekick do this out of the box
3435 slideme this is very handy when you want to buy stuff in countries without paid market actually you mention it in your question posted this answer just for the sake of completeness
3482 in the near future google maps for mobile will be released whose new features include offline storage of area you visit frequently
3483 like waze it is free works offline synchs when youre connected to the internet in some way other than 3g its main advantage is feedback from users it provides live traffic updates from other waze users you can find it here http www waze com download android download
3500 os monitor does that shows the name of the app and the ip address of the connection including whois with map when you click on it edit should mention that the sync icon typically indicates system level sync do you have every item gmail contacts calendar facebook explicitly turned off in the settings
3523 the howtogeek has set of instructions on how to run android on your netbook or desktop here it uses the android builds from android x86 org but dont know how active that project still is however if you just want to try android out youre probably far better off just using the emulator on your pc
3534 dont use the gmail app instead use your browser go to gmail com mobile or desktop view doesnt matter open the mail you want to download the pdf from click on the pdf icon and it will be downloaded automatically about doing so with the gmail app specifically ive no idea and that was how dodge the pdf problem
3535 attachment2sd will do the trick after you install it when you click on the pdf attachment in the gmail app itll pop up the complete action using dialog choose attachment2sd and itll download to directory on your sd card where you can immediately open it or save it for later this works with all kinds of files not just pdf
3538 you can install the wifi keyboard app from android market good app supports both usb and wifi input you need to follow information carefully to get work around
3539 chrome to phone
3542 set the global notifications to silent set the notification on messaging to any ringtone not default repeat for any other app you want notifications for youll still have tone when you 1st plug the phone in to the charger but no tone when its fully charged of course this isnt perfect solution since you need to manually set every other app and presumably some wont have individual notification settings
3545 put the sounds in the media audio notifications folder on your sd card create this folder if it doesnt exist
3546 you can do this from the browser itself using qr droid search for it and install it after that in the browser long click the image and select save image after downloaded open image from notification bar select menu share decode with qr droid
3556 uninstall kies and all drivers then reboot download and install the appropriate drivers from this xda post download and install kies mini from samsung com support at the top then just select your phone model and go to software connect your phone
3559 you dont need to install an app for this settings location and security change screen lock there are other options use pattern because its cool and easy for one hand and relatively secure the puzzle lock the easiest though
3580 when you uninstall an app from the market it asks you for reason if you choose its malicious it will prompt you for report and you can leave comment on the app before uninstalling to warn other users since you have no proof they did or intended to do anything wrong with your info theres nothing else you can do you wont get the app removed from the marketplace
3586 you can do what matthew read mentioned but if you visit the app details page in the android market and scroll all the way to the bottom there is flag as inappropriate link that will allow you to report the app
3600 here is my understanding as developer android right to left support is built in but most roms do not contain the letters this means that hebrew in most applications will show up as boxes but in the correct order this does allow individual applications to include their own fonts and thereby display hebrew correctly android the default system fonts now include hebrew characters right to left layout still works although the rules for justification did change annoyingly based on some bug reports google did not yet consider support for right to left languages to be final in this version note the comments by google engineers such as romain guy here https review source android com change15955 android the sdk has been released but no updates for actual devices the sdk does include hebrew locale for the first time http developer android com sdk android html locs also note that locale support ultimately depends on the vendor of the actual device either the carrier or handset manufacturer they may choose to remove locales they deem unimportant to save space or they may choose to add some that they deem important for their targeted market
3625 you need root to do something like that sorry to say rooting is probably less intrusive than screwing with system services though you could use titanium backup to freeze an app which will prevent if from running or being altered if that causes problems you can simply unfreeze you could use autostarts to control what events trigger what services if service is never triggered it wont run
3628 just figured this one out having had the same problem myself htc desire hd android from the all messages view press the menu button drafts icon appears floppy disk icon press that and it takes you to view of all your drafts press hold draft message to view delete or press the menu button again select delete drafts to go to view where you can bulk mark the drafts you want to delete hope that helps
3637 this is no sandbox application but perhaps its also interesting for you if you havnt already heard about it some scientists startet the project taintdroid realtime privacy monitory for android
3663 heres possible alternative solution if you open the dropbox app then press your camera button and take photo the photo file is automatically added to your dropbox folder and immediately synced to the cloud read about it here http lifehacker com send android photos straight to dropbox
3689 try sugarsync its cloud backup service similar to dropbox they have free gb account as well as cheaper monthly plans than db their android app can be sycned to auto upload all photos or sync folders on your sd ive tried it an it works havent fully tested it but one complaint that have read is that it doesnt respect deletes on your android phone so if you have folder setup to sync and you delete file from that folder on your sd card when it syncs it will download the backed up file back to your sd folder edit added my referral link to sugarsync so if you sign up for free gb account we both get an extra mb of storage and if you sign up for the month gb service we both get free gb
3720 android comes with ifconfig install terminal emulator and type ifconfig eth0 or use netcfg to list all available devices you need root to use ifconfig though
3740 try the free os monitor by eolwral you can see every physical or logical network interface with associated ipv4 and mac addresses as well as total rx ad tx also has open connections and more pretty awesome app for free if you ask me
3741 as of android the majority of the ipv6 protocol seems to be supported with significant parts missing such as dhcpv6 check this google thread for more info specifically the issues listed in this post
3744 use rom manager to install this rom from xda you need to have root otherwise just wait im sure it wont be long till you get the ota update since it was supposed to be released by all carriers yesterday
3755 google maps now supports offline mode
3776 service like dropbox should be able to do this for you itll sync the files up to the web and then your pc with dropbox installed should pull them down
3794 you want to monitor any apps that use data in the background its hard to say which ones because there are so many and have no idea what you have installed recommend installing two apps to help you monitor and control your data so you dont go over phone usage this app allows you to monitor how much data you are using and set daily weekly and monthly limits it does this for voice and text too and it will notify you when you go over the limits there are number of others like this some will tell you when you are getting close other put widget on your homescreen to show your data usage test couple out to see which ones work best with your phone quick settings this app will allow you to manually control your data with it you can turn off on auto syncing you can also toggle the apn so you it turns off all 3g data without affecting the phone or wifi so you can still get auto updates when you are connected to wifi but only use 3g data when you choose to finally if you really want to take control of things you can get tasker and set different rules about when you use wifi and when you use 3g and what apps are allowed to sync
3796 droidwall is an application for rooted phones that will let you select which applications are allowed to use which data networks wifi vs cellular 2g 3g 4g you can use it to make sure that certain applications always have data access when needed and restrict other applications to wifi or even no acess
3817 to better control your gmail storage in android you can adjust the number of days that are synced the control is in place many people dont think to look it is in the labels section in there you can adjust syncing to certain amount of days use days depending on your daily volume you may need to go to day or could go up to there is also granular control you could keep your starred emails around for days while everything else is at days it is all about gmails label setup it is better to think that you dont really have an inbox you have emails that are labeled inbox hope this helps out once you make the change it will sync up and reduce your storage right away recommend turning off and on the phone after making the change just like computer the android phones like reboot from time to time
3833 untested by me but check out finger letter handwriting theres also handwritingnote but it seems bit limited qmemo also seems like an alternative based on what you require
3834 you can also choose to replace the default gmail app with the k9 mail client the main plus point being it can handle other pop3 imap4 accounts as well as keep the storage for your email accounts on the sd card this option does make it little slow for first access but if space in your internal memory is at premium then this might save space you can also try other smaller twitter clients like tweetdeck or touiteur or even web based mobile site like http twitter com or http tweete net that would obviate the need for client app wrt swype if you prefer other ordinary keyboards there are plethora of them available in the market like better keyboard smart keyboard etc which are far smaller in size but certainly dont have swypes functionality
3845 netflix recently posted on their blog that they will begin to roll out support for individual devices in the coming year but not generic netflix app they claim the hurdle has been the lack of generic and complete platform security and content protection mechanism available for android you can read the entire post at http blog netflix com netflix on android html
3848 sparxs suggestions seem pretty good here are few more also untested genial handwriting myletter this one seems if graffiti for android very cool if it works because it converts the handwritten notes to text
3861 ok ive found way to deactivate motoblur without rooting the phone reset the phone to factory settings privacy or sd and storage factory data reset when the phone reboot cancel the configuration of motoblur take of the widget who remind you to configure it and its done
3871 recently had similar requirement and found busybox utility the terminal emulator apps are useful however those support very few commands however busybox gave me access to most of the generally used linux commands here is how used it
3884 looks like there are several options here are couple of the more popular apps wififofum appbrain description wififofum scans for wifi networks and displays information about each including ssid mac rssi channel and security wififofum also allows you to connect to networks you find and log the location using the gps kml logs can be emailed wifi scanner appbrain description no ads option to connect added for open networks update comming soon free wifi scanner for wireless networks for android the wifi signal is displayed in dbm format if you are looking to sniff traffic try shark for root appbrain description traffic sniffer works on 3g and wifi works on froyo tethered mode too to open dump use wireshark or similar software for preview dump on phone use shark reader based on tcpdump please leave comments send mail if you have any problems suggestions
3885 there are quite few apps capable of detecting wifi networks however pixie root only is the only passive wifi detector that im aware of
3887 use wifi analyzer free tool which gives good range of wifi detections it will show you things like signal strengths encryption levels ssids on overlapping channels and few other details
3980 havent tried it yet myself but here is an xda thread featuring program that lets you move any app on or off your sd card and set the installation default to internal sd or auto believe auto is the default
3993 there is feature request on androids bug tracker for this if youre intent on seeing this feature click on the
4002 this is unfortunately not adjustable in the stock version of android if you root there are 3rd party versions that modify this low battery level
4004 as soon and as often as you can spending time at any extreme of charge high or low can damage lithium batteries high charge isnt that bad considering how quickly modern devices will drain away from that state spending time at lower charge levels will damage the internal structure of the battery though draining to on the device wont actually immediately kill the battery though the battery protection circuitry will prevent it from going down to critical levels but the more time you spend at lower charges the more cumulative damage you do and the more time you take away from the lifespan of the battery do the best you can to avoid this and youll likely have battery that still gives you of its life by the time the device is considered obsolete
4005 lithium ion batteries dont develope memory like nickel cadnuim batteries so charging every day regardless of your discharge level will not affect the battery life if my memory serves me right because of the way that the batteries are recharged it is less strain on the battery if you dont let it get below but wouldnt worry too much about it in that same respect dont be hesitant to charge anytime you have the opportunity
4047 think this question on superuser answers your question that the fat filesystem on the sd card does not support symlinks just to clarify and as reflected in the su question answers linked the android os supports symlinks but the fat filesystem on the sd card does not
4056 android does support symbolic links but certain file systems fat or rfs do not and you cannot create symbolic links in those partitions if your device uses filesystem that supports symbolic links ext2 ext3 ext4 yaffs2 then you should be able to use ln from the terminal emulator
4111 try downloading and using third camera app from the market the restriction is apparently on the stock camera app not on the hardware the camera itself downloaded retro camera and it is able to take picture when my galaxy is on low battery that might not be the app you want so do search on the market with the keyword camera
4114 during call press the volume up button youre bound by what levels the manufacturer allows for in the phone any other law needed to be met within your country if youre technically inclined flash your phone with kernel that uses pershoot audio booster usually oc uv
4115 from searching android forums see that some people had screen protectors covering the speaker could this be your issue also saw reference to the quick settings app which has voice call volume setting hopefully you can set that to its highest setting and your calls will at least be set to the loudest setting
4119 there are apps on the market that can do this on most rooted phone barnacle is pretty popular for this and people seem to like it actually the first review for the app is someone doing exactly what you want to do just with an ipad just search for barnacle wifi hotspot on the market good luck
4147 for completeness now got the tablet to connect to adhoc wpa supplicant conf edit ctrl interface data misc wifi wpa supplicant ctrl interface group update config ap scan added ap scan so it scans all networks including ad hoc this causes priorities to be ignored below it just goes through the networks one by one this can really slow things down recommend putting simple file like this with the ad hoc network at the top on your sdcard and then just copy to data misc wifi directory when needed sure someone could write script to backup current and swap in adhoc one added my ad hoc network network ssid yourssid key mgmt none wep key0 only needed if you use wep if ascii no if hex wep key0 mode needed to indicate ad hoc mode priority normal access point network network ssid exampleap key mgmt none auth alg open shared wep key0 priority
4188 you can uninstall it and the market will remember that you bought it itll say purchased in the market and you can reinstall any time every time reflash rom go into my downloads section of the market and see all my purchased apps
4207 no if the phone is off it cant do anything if its in sleep mode where the screen is off and its not in use then the alarm will still function as will other types of notifications have never tried this specifically on galaxy but am fairly confident this is universal rule
4225 procedure for most android phones is open the market application click your phones menu button click downloads or my downloads click name of app that you previously purchased click install button note if youve also changed the google account associated with the phone then youll lose the ability to install apps purchased under the old account
4232 yes you can ive used swype as well as touchpal keyboard as alternatives once you install any new keyboard just go to settings language keyboard to set your keyboard text settings
4233 found that even after changing the setting it didnt use the new keyboard had to do long press in text field that showed an option for which input method to use once selecting the new keyboard it worked all the time
4238 yes no prefer lookout but all the av companies have apps avg mcaffee norton
4244 yes and no no because androids and linuxs security scheme is impenetrable as long as you dont give root access or permissions without root malicious program cannot take over your systems integrity there is very little zero day exploit in linux android and without permissions malicious program cannot risk your privacy personal data hardware that can risk your personal data camera mic location internet sd card etc however yes because nobody pays attention to those permissions and security warnings also android can still be vector for windows viruses even though the android itself will not be affected by windows virus the geinimi trojan that matt pointed out relies on the program convincing the user to went through the standard install uninstall prompt without being suspicious no market is not safe place any developers can upload any program to market and google does not screen those programs however google will and do remove any reported rogue programs quite quickly refer to matts answer
4264 suspect this is very much device dependent but on the htc desire hd you can press the physical volume down button to silence the ringtone whilst allowing the call to continue
4265 the htc desire allows you to flip the phone face down to silence that call if that doesnt work with the samsung then you can probably use tasker to arrive at similar result put the phone into silent mode when its face down
4292 believe if you uninstall the last fm app then use the voice action listen to pop up should show asking which of the default players listed here will show up and be used if however youd prefer the default in built player to play use listen to or the app choice dialer available in both free and paid versions in the market
4293 you can clear the preferred program from settings applications manage applications last fm clear defaults then the next time you launch the voice action youd be prompted with list of players click on the make default then on your new preferred application
4298 for samsung galaxy the way is to hold the volume down button if you just press nothing happens or maybe you have to press it several times before it completely stops ringing dont know but holding it makes it stop immediately
4314 actually had the same problem as you and searched the help dictionary you have to swype from down to the spacebar in order for it to auto cap its not as easy to find or widely known also as heads up you can do this with too the brilliant thing about it is that you only have to be close to the and in order for it to space cap
4360 no the data shouldnt pass through google servers unless you are viewing site hosted by goolge
4371 actually the predictive search from the address bar sends the text you enter to google to provide the search predictions for example if you start to type search and get to sea it suggests sears seattle times sean parker etc

4552 samsung galaxy can output to tv using special micro usb to hdmi cable http www youtube com watchv gtqbax bdfk
4555 bought an acer aspire netbook and it has windows and android pre installed
4556 samsung have dock for the galaxy tab which connects it to pretty much full size keyboard and props the screen in position where its like laptops screen there are also number of android devices that have video or hdmi out capability to output their screen onto tv often needing special converter cable bluetooth is an option for connecting keyboards keypro appbrain link official website andteksoft blueinput appbrain link official website load drivers onto your phone to let you use bluetooth hid to connect up many bluetooth keyboards trial versions are free to test your devices compatibility but it looks like if you want to carry on using it youll have to pay to register to make it work fully there are other options for loading bluetooth hid keyboard drivers onto your phone if you root it also see these previous questions regarding connecting peripherals such as keyboards and mice to android devices using bluetooth bluetooth keyboard with android what else can bluetooth do external hardware keyboards from android honeycomb android upwards certain devices that have usb host support built into their hardware can attach and use normal usb keyboards and mice with the appropriate usb host micro usb to usb converter cable have occasionally plugged in used keyboard this way on my motorola xoom
4572 android comes with an email app that lets you use any pop3 imap or exchange account talk can be replaced by meebo ebuddy messenger and many others voice is fairly unique service but some features can be sort of replaced you can use sip phone number and an app like sipdroid for calls or something like kik messenger for text like instant messages think blackberry messenger searching maps in the market shows several results that look promising same with calendar the email app is very very buggy and low on features im confident there are other mail apps that are better though on the other hand talk is also pretty buggy find ebuddy to be much better and many people have problems with calendar when it really comes down to it quality app is quality app whether google wrote it or not android doesnt seem to be as biased toward googles apps as windows was towards microsofts apps my hodgepodge of google and non google apps works well for me and im sure you can get set of apps that will work at least as well overall as googles apps do
4584 what are the non google alternatives to gmail talk voice maps google calendar on the nexus one cant say specifically about nexus one but the stock android platform does not come with google branded apps so yes it is possible for the phone to live without google however imo if youre using android and avoiding googles services youre missing lot the stock email application can sync to gmail or other mail services through imap and pop however just like syncing gmail from desktop through thunderbird outlook you wont be able to use the unique gmail features like priority inbox archival labeling etc applications that uses cloud to device messaging push to device requires google account without c2dm applications would have to poll their servers periodically therefore draining the battery there are alternative implementations c2dm that does not connect to googles servers however most programs are not designed for those alternative implementations and may have problems googles android market is the largest android market place needless to say you wont be able to download as much apps as easily if you avoid googles android market google maps and navigations can be replaced by waze navdroyd ndrive rmaps etc dont think theres good replacement for streetview however there are certainly replacements for google calendar however ive not used any of them so cannot comment on how good they are do they really perform as fast as the native google apps services yes if were to believe googles words none of the googles apps use any hidden android apis that could magically cause their software to outperform other applications however because google is google googles own apps typically have the best integration to the android platform and 3rd party programs typically would prefer to integrate their own apps with googles applications also since nexus one is pure google experience phone this means rooting and installing custom roms on nexus one is among the easiest from all android devices
4624 format zero your sd card perform factory reset
4625 as said already factory reset for start if you care about the privacy about what is on the sd card you should use secure erase utility even after formatting the card you can still recover the data if you google for secure erase youll find bunch of freeware tools to do the job
4663 google talk and gmail each behave this way found this out by asking here actually so when you drag down the notification bar gmail and google talk will not appear in the recent apps list however you will see them in recent apps if you navigate to them using an application launcher im not certain if the same is true for google voice
4674 found the problem to be like one of the guys said in another thread it was the external sd having most likely unrecognized characters at least to samsung kies or characters that are too long removed the external sd and ran kies and its working it might not be very useful to do it this way but only needed it to update sw and manage contacts so its find
4677 unfortunately you cant change the number of screens and still use the htc sense ui at least not in any of the versions ive seen you can uninstall it or turn it off but then you wont have free access to all of the htc widgets if you like those if you really want the performance kick youll get from less screens in total and therefore using less ram youll have to go back to vanilla android simply using less widgets as youve done will certainly help somewhat feel you pain too really only need screens for my favorite widgets and folders but kind of like some of the htc widgets
4683 this is because the recent applications list only displays the applications activities in android an activity is the window of the application google talk and gmail always run in background as service not an activity the application activity is killed by android when it is not used and this is the case with those applications even if they still run in background
4684 in general the less widgets you use on your home screens the better performance your phone is going to have less processing for widgets if you want to reduce the number of homescreens then suggest switching to another home launcher such as launcherpro which will let you change how many homescreens you have launcherpro has some similar widgets to htcs sense too
4741 there is no power to the phone when its off its actually off some phones have minimalistic charging mode that just shows battery animation but have yet to see an android device that boots into clock only type mode the android os is designed to use minimal power when not in use if you have problem with the battery dying overnight its probably due to third party app
4744 you can do this with google voice although its perhaps not ideal since people would have to text your gvoice number and not your actual phone number theres the web interface of course as well as great chrome extension if you use chrome
4750 there is this similar question in superuser https superuser com questions send sms from pc through android phone gtalksms allows you to send various commands including sending sms by sending gtalk message to yourself which will trigger various events note that you need 3rd party gtalk software pidgin since the official google talk client does not allow you to send message to yourself or alternatively you can use different account for your phone download link open in android or scan qr also if youre using android or higher and have the chrometophone apps open in android installed you can send arbitrary text in your clipboard copy paste buffer to your phone using foxtophone open in firefox or chrometophone open in chrome extension using foxtophone right click on the send to phone button and click send clipboard and whatever text in your clipboard will be send to the phones clipboard which you can paste to any textbox in android by long press paste download app open in android or scan qr
4767 sounds like android notifier delivers part of your request notifications and text of messages on your pc dont see the capability to reply unfortunately that seems good feature though perhaps you could request it of the developers
4768 if you have android try texdro tried few of the other related apps and this worked the best for me it allows you to send and receive texts from your computer it also allows you to silence sms notifications on your phone while the program is running so you can just be notified on your computer or you can be notified on both the free version of the app allows you only to connect via wifi and the pro version adds usb and bluetooth options will probably be purchasing the pro version when get some handy mostly to support the dev because wifi connectivity works fine for me texdro desktop sms for android on appbrain android market qr code
4815 it doesnt apply to google maps navigation afaik but you should ask this specific question to your local verizon dealer for instance use google maps navigation on my htc droid incredible and friend uses it on the motorola droid each with verizon but again be sure to ask before you buy the phone
4817 yes it works on droid on verizon although the app might have unrelated issues http androidforums com post1 html
4819 had droid for about year google maps works great recently switched it out for samsung fascinate the fascinate comes with verizon navigator pre loaded but downloaded and installed the google maps without any issues do not pay for the verizon navigator application at the additional month also have used titaniumbackup to freeze lots of the preloaded programs from verizon have had zero issues with doing that the fascinate had an issue with the gps taking while to lock on but it has recently been addressed in software update using google maps and navigation is something that use daily
4822 htc now has an official way for vodafone users to do this
4836 gps is passive technology it doesnt get notified of new position it works it out by listening to the gps signals it receives and doing some maths the options in gps apps that allow you to choose the minimum distance are there to make your location appear more stable small variations in your calculated location would otherwise make for lots and lots of waypoints on your track if thats what youre recording making for much increased filesize depending on what your app does when you change position you might get some power savings by increasing this value but that would be down to the app doing less with the position once it has it rather than by getting your position less frequently the glympse app for example continually sends your position to the glympse servers if you could choose how often to update that position you could maybe save some power but you wouldnt be saving any power on the gps side of things
4845 first reason the gps can reduce power consumption if the gps is turned off however if the gps is turned off and the user moves too far away the gps will have to redo lot of initialization calculations which can take about minutes in typical gps device though can be slightly faster if the device knows an approximate location or if it does not need to be too accurate this initialization wastes lot of power and so android usually keeps the gps turned on for while the gps driver uses those parameters to make decisions whether to turn off gps or keeping it turned on will be much more economical second reason poorly written applications are much more difficult to write with how androids gps api is if the gps driver simply fired callbacks as fast as it can then poorly written software can just process as much as it can instead of filtering only those that it needs also this kind of api forces programmer to explicitly think about their frequency and accuracy requirement and allow the driver to better manage power vs accuracy tradeoff in many cases in areas with high cell tower density android might decide to simply use network location and on other places to use gps when the network location is unreliable all that can be done transparently to application programmers
4874 your old mobile phone wasnt really off when you turned it off
4879 according to this google page the android gmail app uses an ssl connection in both directions
4905 am the developer of locale battery life is key metric that we test extensively the only feature in locale that has any real effect on the battery is the location condition at the time of this writing the location condition in locale can accurately detect meter location changes within minutes on average while using or less of the battery if youve configured locale to turn wi fi or bluetooth on off then battery life may actually improve depending on the exact configuration
4931 the app has to support moving to the sd card the feature should be in android your phone doesnt have to be rooted in order to do it
4948 hit the hard menu button on your phone and then choose settings from there browse to the wireless controls section and then choose wi fi settings whilst in the wi fi settings section push the hard menu button again and select advanced press use static ip to put check in the box and then enter the network settings as per your own network if you re not sure what your settings are and assuming you re using windows open command prompt by clicking start then run type in cmd and hit enter type the line ipconfig all and hit enter the relevant details should be listed there just make sure you use different number for ip address on your phone than is shown on your pc
4950 some android phones like the nexus one have special contacts that tell the os when the phone has been docked the desire actually doesnt have these so cant automatically detect that it has been docked car home can still be launched manually another option is to look at an app like tasker you could configure car home to be launched when certain conditions are met like the phone is on charge and in vertical position so docked there are many other ways you could use tasker for this
4957 typically the phone knows whether it has been docked by the placement of magnet on certain area on the back of the phone you can therefore create your own cheap dock using magnet and some sort of stand here is an example with the droid
4958 shootme does work for me on the galaxy tab even if did not root it and the shootme page says that it works only for rooted devices
4960 details how to accomplish this by simply adding another account to the phone and then selecting it in google play store settings its worth noting that originally the only way to change the google account associated with the google play store was to do factory reset of your phone and set it up again from scratch
4964 unfortunately it doesnt work when phone is powered off as some have already suggested my suggestion put it into airplane mode this way the phone almost consumes zero energy due to not having any network connection and so on and you have good chance that the battery will last until the morning where the alarm shall go off
4967 there are methods of app2sd the official method pros give the best experience with the least hassle as you would never mistakenly move apps that should not be moved officially supported does not need rooted phones cons only available in android and above only apps that are specifically marked as movable by the author can be moved the rooted method pros works on pre phones you can move apps that you know are safe but the author have not yet updated the app to support app2sd more variations to suit your specific need some variants of rooted app2sd will just move all applications while some other variants allows you to choose which apps you want to move or move only applications that supports app2sd cons phone must be rooted may cause system instability if you move apps that are not supposed to be moved home screen widgets apps with background services etc not officially supported can move any apps to sd yes if you use rooted app2sd no if you are using official app2sd is there specific version of andoid that should run for rooted method any version should be fine for official method you need android or above should my phone be rooted for that or stock version works too yes for rooted method you need rooted phones for android and above no stock version works
4973 use quickmark qr code reader the most popular is simply called barcode scanner
4974 prefer google goggles available in the market for qr scanning to download an app the most recent version now sees the qr and automatically captures it older version required you to snap the picture before it is processed then presents link to the market
4976 no it is available for non rooted devices as well for non rooted devices it is possible to move apps to sd too but only for new android versions starting at usually the apps must be prepared to allow the system to move it to the sd but you can on your android device move any app to the sd prepared or not this is done with this commands adb shell pm setinstalllocation so answering you q1 can move any apps to sd yes q2 is there specific version of android that should run q3 should my phone be rooted for that or does it work for stock versions too no root needed should work on every android device note do it at your own risk mean widgets on sd will not be able to show on desktop running services can stop working if they are moved to sd and you umount your card etc note you need the android sdk in order to use adb you only need to download it from here http developer android com sdk index html access and perform the necessary steps to download the sdk the adb command is on the tools folder note if you run this command only new installs will automatically go to the sd card already installed apps need to be moved manually
4977 barcode scanner is the best you can also create qr codes to share with others on their website
4978 thanks to this answer to this question is moving apps to sd only available to rooted devices ive discovered the getinstalllocation adb command and set the install location to internal on my un rooted phone with the android sdk installed and my phone connected via usb with usb debugging mode switched on enter the following commands adb devices check that adb can see my phone and start necessary services adb shell connects shell to the phone pm getinstalllocation returns auto pm setinstalllocation sets the default install location to internal memory pm getinstalllocation run again to check that it is now set to the correct location returns internal exit safely remove hardware unplug phone and all done without any need for root
5002 if by internal gps you mean the postion fix using gps satellites you can use gps status toolbox app to get fix and also know how long it took to get the fix
5010 id say fire up google maps and see if you are where it says you are
5027 am fairly certain this cant be done under even if you backup the lockscreen data do factory reset and restore the data only the lockscreen type is restored and not the actual pattern or password its designed not to be altered except by the settings app
5046 be an activist and upvote the defect here though thats longer term answer
5049 when googles vice president of engineering vic gundotra announced froyo in his keynote for google last may he showed that they are working on new website where we will be able to search browse and install apps directly from the website however up to this day january no more words has been heard of that website ever since note that everything in this paragraph is speculative my guess is that they are holding back the website to launch with honeycomb or probably for google or they may be going to announce honeycomb on google edit no they just given peek preview of honeycombs tablet feature at ces they havent released any honeycomb device yet though edit2 honeycomb is now released also it is possible that web install will only be for android and above due to c2dm requirement though google might have other solutions another possibility is they are scraping the site and are now wishing for everyone to forget what they were saying in front of thousands of audience and practically eternal youtube audiences but keep in mind that its really up to googles strategic on how and when they will launch the new site edit3 android web market have been released for some time now at https market android com for now though appbrain and androidzoom provide similar functionalities
5050 how physically close will tag need to be for the phone to detect nfc card 10cm or can it greater http en wikipedia org wiki near field communication nfc is intentionally very low ranged since it is meant to be difficult to accidentally connect to the wrong nfc readers one of its possible applications is to aid in initiating longer ranged connection bluetooth or wifi with zero configuration also can the phone present itself as nfc tag to other phones if this is possible is the range greater as the nfc transmitter is powered no currently nexus only have nfc reader it cannot emulate nfc tag http www nearfieldcommunicationsworld com google unveils first android nfc phone but nexus is limited to tag reading only for now there are plans for future android releases to support nfc card emulation but nexus wont be getting it since it lacks the necessary hardware can think of several ways to hack around this with some limitations since static nfc tag can be made as sticker but full nfc card emulation will not be available in nexus
5051 this depends on the screen technology for instance it was said that android gingerbread has dark theme since googles latest flagship device nexus uses super amoled display which consumes less energy when displaying dark color since amoled produces its own light and darker color emits less photons contrasts with lcd display which uses backlight fixed number of photons and the lcd crystals filters those colors it needs the crystals on an lcd displays though actually consume slightly less power when displaying white since it takes more power to strain the crystal to block more light screen color does not affect the backlighting there are certain display technologies in tvs that tries to give dynamic backlighting by dimming the screen when displaying darker image im not aware of any device that actually ships with that type of screen though
5052 on oled amoled and super amoled screens yes lcd screens no
5065 from what ive read tasker should be able to do this you can turn on or off the screen lock mechanism based upon whatever criteria you want including the value of variable you can also change the value of variable via widget combine the two and it should work caveat lector ive researched tasker ive read about what it can and cant do but ive never tried it yet so take this as speculation
5086 the one you want is clear defaults once clicked the handler select dialog will pop up next time you invoke that particular action
5087 believe they are talking about the clear defaults option im not dev but believe that when you install firefox the default complete action for all the browser related actions and intents is cleared and so when user clicks on link or bookmark they are given the complete action with dialog from there they can choose firefox as the default once this is done in order to undo it youd choose the clear defaults option to the best of my knowledge this is all that is available from user standpoint anything beyond that is in the development territory which is off topic here and better suited for so
5098 if your screen has an older standard lcd then this doesnt help at all the backlight is still shining behind all those darkened pixels you just cant see it if you have oled amoled super amoled led lcd or think even plasma then it does help to darken the screen because the light is generated specifically where it is needed btw there are fire fox plugins that reformat whatever page you are on to be dark dont remember the names but needed it when was living in studio apartment with my girlfriend and was up all night on my computer while she was trying to sleep feet away in the same room
5104 theres always risk with not cleanly unmounting file system by pulling the battery youre not allowing the system to finish up what its doing on the sd card and if you catch it at the right time it can sadly screw things up pretty badly with some luck you may be able to run diagnostic on the file system and recover some of the data but it all depends on the specifics
5107 some file systems are pretty robust if you used ext3 and yaffs2 the chance of getting caught in situation where the filesystem cannot recover is scarcer than winning lottery these file system utilizes logging to revert inconsistencies at every startup android will check the filesystems log if the log is not empty that means the file system is not unmounted cleanly and it will automatically perform quick recovery you usually wont notice anything just seconds longer startup there is small chance that the last data that have not been committed may be lost but it is for all practical purpose impossible to lose the whole file system unfortunately some filesystems commonly used in certain android devices are not so robust many manufacturers partition their sd cards as fat and with fat every time your device crashes you are playing game of russian roulette samsung phones had proprietary variant of fat which they called rfs robust file system they claim rfs is compatible with fat but is robust in the event of crash so far hadnt observed any data corruption on my samsung phone though it is still better to be wary since samsung is bad at writing software
5156 using wifi not using your data plan so that will help reduce data usage from your provider so long as you are not streaming music video youtube etc or downloading large amounts of data podcasts for example then you should be fine or at least save those activities for when you are on wifi downloading apps each app can be anywhere from 100kb to 10mb in size save these for your wifi unless it is an update you really need then and there weather maps shouldnt be too heavy of data same with google voice
5157 yes agree with everything that bryan has said but want to add you can use an app like phone usage that helps you monitor your network traffic the pro version also allows you to set data limits that will send you notification if you go over so you could set it to mb and youd know when you are getting close and you can throttle down your usage verizon has day return policy although think they are changing it to days so you can monitor your traffic and if you find that you are using waaay too much you can always cancel and go back to what ever you had before another useful app if youve rooted your device if droidwall which lets you set which apps can access your 3g connection this would be useful if you identify that an app that requires background sync and uses lot of data it would also be good if you are getting close to you mb limit and want to lock down your data usage finally many apps let you set wifi only rule for example beyondpod has setting in the apps that says only download podcasts when on wifi but if you really want to take control of your phone you can download tasker and set an almost unlimited set of rules for how your phone operates
5162 hey just ran load of test to figure this out they are vaguely scientific tests figured out that was saving battery by switching to dark wallpaper and dark themed apps have look through my write up you should be able to work out the saving on your phone http blog stevemould com phone battery save black wallpaper
5234 believe you want cat proc mtd also useful mount
5267 charging from usb port of computer is slower than charging using charger because the voltage and amperage provided by the computer is considerably lower than in the case of using normal charger so the mobile is using slow charge mode don know which is the charging speed ration between usb and normal charger in the case of sgs but in my case htc desire with normal charger need approximately to hours for full charge but with usb connection that time only charges to percent
5270 computer usb port is limited to milliamperes or ma for usb port the dedicated wall charger on the other hand is usually able to provide ma or more lets take the case where connected phone uses ma then the usb port would have ma left to charge the battery while the wall usb charger would have ma left typical smart phone battery has capacity of about mah milliamperes hour nowadays this means that in perfectly efficient world current of ma would charge the battery in hour so the same battery would then charge in hours over the usb port and in about 1h50 with the wall charger of course in reality power losses would also affect charging times but these numbers are quite close to what get with my actual phone
5274 just kill the apn connection settings somewhere under settings and there is actually switch for mobile internet disable that as well worked like charm for me if you cant find it add the power savings widget to your home screen it has that option
5278 use apndroid also available in the marketplace for free you can easily turn data on or off with the press of button add the apndroid widget to your home screen to easily turn data on or off
5291 on my galaxy you can hold the power button for second and menu will come up just hit data network mode to deactivate it you can reactivate it the same way if you dont have that you should be able to go to settings wireless and network mobile networks and uncheck data enabled or use packet data or similar
5297 gtasks allows you to work with you task list offline on your phone and then sync when you have internet as do most task managers that sync with google tasks ive never tried any of the others but can say from experience that gtasks works well
5302 astrid works fine with google tasks it syncs with google tasks and can work offline
5342 in the stock android messaging app you can hold your finger on message for few moments and then select the copy message text option then paste it into any app youd like that would work fine for individual messages as far as entire threads go that im not sure id probably go the geeky route personally and open up the db file that contains all the text messages with an sqlite3 binary and manually peruse the database copying what need out of it
5343 sms backup will backup and can restore too your sms messages to your gmail account you have to enable imap in gmail the nice thing about it it does it automatically it can also backup your call log too email too
5383 in the android sdk is tool called ddms it will allow you to take screenshots theres also apps on the market that can do this but think they require root
5385 you can use an app called shootme from the market to do this easily requires root you can also use the android sdk to do it without root but you have to be connected to your computer
5391 more of googles products are now implementing the google cloud printing service read more on that on the official google mobile blog http googlemobile blogspot com cloud printing on go html that might become an option to print from the android phone in the coming months
5392 android cannot just run native java applications android does not have java virtual machine android uses dalvik virtual machine which is completely different while android applications are written in java it is subset of actual java so even if you could run the jar files through converter there is no guarantee the code is actually supported by dalvik
5393 know nothing about minecraft but cant see how it would be possible without rewriting big chunks of it even if you can convert the jar to an apk there are many java classes that are not part of the android api furthermore android does not include awt swing or java 2d 3d it has its own ui and graphics apis so the user interface would need to be rewritten
5426 am the developer of locale and wanted to make sure the most up to date information is available here locale does support backup and restore more information about this feature can be found on our website at http feedback twofortyfouram com forums locale feedback suggestions backup settings ref title we publish headphones plug in condition and free media volume setting for locale giving locale the ability to adjust media volume based on headphones being plugged in unplugged
5458 according to this blog post you need 5mm rca phono cable and it goes in the headphone socket of the phone
5459 see this page for the galaxy ss standard tv out cable as sold by samsung this plugs into the 5mm headphone port on the phone it can also output hdmi via an adaptor that plugs into the micro usb port though this has the obvious disadvantage that you cant plug it into power to charge at the same time as playing
5567 use dropbox put the apk in your dropbox folder open up the dropbox app on your phone find the apk tap on it and it should download it to your phone and then install it use the sd card plug your phone into the computer via usb mount the sd card drive copy the apk into the sd card unmount your phone browse to the apk using file browser app such as astro tap on the apk and it should present to install it there are countless other ways to do this but these two are probably the easiest
5569 another way place the apk file onto your sd card by using your phone as mounted drive enable applications from unknown sources go to settings applications then verify that unknown sources is selected use an application such as installer or apk manager to install the application
5575 prefer using the adb however its little less user friendly this isnt the easiest way but it will work without an sd card and will work without the device being internet connectedsome devicestablets arent at the command line you would type adb install full absolute path to apk here apk the tools directory of the sdk must be in your path for the adb command to work
5580 you can now search and install apps from the android market website it apparently launched today and people myself included are having trouble loggin in but im sure theyll clear it up soon now you can search apps filter by free vs paid and sort by relevance or popularity there is also button on each listing for install which will probably be like appbrains service that causes the app to automatically download on you phone when youre able to actually login when you visit http market android com on your phone you actually see the site but if you click on any apps or search you are redirected to the market app
5629 go to settings accounts and sync ensure auto sync is checked check the relevant accounts to see if sync is enabled for them click the account and see whats checked off
5630 another possible cause is your phones memory full if your phone is low on free memory it will not sync any new data to it youll have to uninstall some apps or move them to the sd card to resolve this
5641 there are actually several alternatives to the official google android market aka play store personally like to search for new apps from my pc browser and bit less from my phone most all of the markets nowadays offer both via dedicated phone app that youll have to install except from the official one which is already there until well yesterday the official market would not have been available from your pc meaning on pc web browser now it is with neat push to your phone one click installation that is taking away one of the advantages of the competition see appbrain the alternative markets though have still their peculiarities ill make short summary but dont expect it to highlight all of the differences some markets andspot do not offer very specific features to users but try to gather developers by offering advanced features such as easy stats amazon appstore latest big entry countries limitations catalog looking very promising with some exclusive good pay for apps also features special offers and daily freebies def worth checking out appbrain born to let you install android market applications directly from your pc web browser also allows you to discover new apps based on the ones you have its meta store my favourite before the official market update apkpure dont need any registration to use it slideme they provide applications to niche markets based on geographic location payment method or even types of applications that users cant find in traditional channels samsung apps must be installed on samsung galaxy devices or else you cant use this samsung app store which of course requires you to own samsung android device droid they distribute foss open source packages that pass audit and verification to ensure that code have no malicious parts getjar my latest discovery quite lot of apps and they have specials gold commercial apps for free extremely interesting platform for developers since they seem to offer above the average marketing and ps activities torrapk its free and it distributes only free android apps through their apk files if you are developer you can get your account and publish your apps nb not sure how legit the apps there are though appsfire used to be yet another app for discovering official market applications ios android now an app advertising agency ill add that theres market for adult apps too now and lot of review forum sites will link to one or more of these markets androidtapp or androidpit androlib suggest you click on some of these links and see for yourself if the look applications suit your style thanks to various sources in particular this thenextweb com article and lot of other stackexchange editing for neverending memory the following are no longer available andspot focused around an app for sharing and discovering apps handango by appia com huge cross platform symbian android java winmobile market aproov quite different web look register to download via specific phone app mobihand onlyandroid more focused on expensive pay apps but offers discounts and free deals
5676 appbrain will make it easy to restore your apps after the reset install appbrain firstish and use it to get back all the apps you had before sync before you reset market will remember your paid apps so youll be able to get those without having to repay your google app data mail contacts calendar are backed up to the cloud already so you shouldnt have to do anything special with them if you really want to you could export them to csv file but you shouldnt have to you probably dont need to but would copy the contents of the sd card to temporary location just in case as for other apps that keep data only local cant speak to those know that for myself everything important has backup somewhere else yay dropbox unfortunately or actually fortunately dont have any personal experience with factory reset everything ive read says that its really not that bad excepting those apps that dont have dynamic storage strategies good luck
5726 for google cloud things such as contacts do need to backup the cloud version just in case so the phone doesnt wipe them from the cloud if you set your contact list to sync with gmails contact list you do not need to backup your gmails contacts list just like every cloud based services you would need to change how you think about where data is stored gmails contact list is not backup of the phones contact list the gmails version is the primary reference copy and the phones contact list is just local cache of the online version unfortunately or in your particular case fortunately sms storage is not cloud service if you do factory reset you lose all your sms messages therefore you need to do manual backup of your sms messages there are multitudes of sms backup apps in the market both free and paid dont know which ones plays wells with the sms bug since dont experience the bug myself hard resetting the phone will not affect the sd card correct yes your sd card is your own data android will not touch the sd card in any way when doing factory resets my paid apps come back from market anyway right yes android market purchases are tied to your gmail account and you should not need to repay any of your paid apps as long as you used the same account however if you purchased apps outside of android market you may need to contact the developer of those app or the alternative market where you made the purchase and ask their policy on this have appbrain is that automatically remembering all apps have on the phone yes including those you install directly from the market just make sure you sync your app list with appbrain before you do factory reset
5761 one should be careful to differentiate between the gmail app and the default mail client gmail app the gmail app is the pre installed app created by google that can only be used with gmail the answer to whether or not the gmail app is secure requires some understanding of android app security this passage from the dev guide explains how developers may connect to an ssl socket to securely send tcp ip communications since the gmail app uses ssl sockets when sending and receiving mail all communications are secure citation needed mail client unlike the gmail app the default mail client can be used with any email account including gmail when using this client to send and receive gmail an ssl connection must be used the app is therefore also secure google explains how to do this in their help pages
5769 this shows the difference between agps and gps agps assisted gps uses small amount of mobile data to establish rough location fix about 1km 100m accuracy based on the cell towers near you this gives faster initial location fix than just gps since you had roaming disabled agps wasnt available and getting location fix on just gps can take while especially on some firmware versions of the galaxy
5774 ive actually been writing an application that uses gps so can shed some light on this onik is correct about the agps vs gps additionally though gps can be affected by number of factors which can reduce accuracy or the ability to receive signal at all gps accuracy is affected by number of factors including satellite positions noise in the radio signal atmospheric conditions and natural barriers to the signal noise can create an error between to meters and results from static or interference from something near the receiver or something on the same frequency objects such mountains or buildings between the satellite and the receiver can also produce error sometimes up to meters the most accurate determination of position occurs when the satellite and receiver have clear view of each other and no other objects interfere as well with agps is dgps differential gps but do not believe phones have this only agps like the agps the dgps uses fixed gps location such as cell tower to send information to the gps receiver dgps however looks at both the satellite and the fixed location adjusts for any difference between the two and then sends that information to the receiver dgps is particularly helpful when atmospheric conditions interfere with reception source more information in short make sure you are outside and have clear view of the sky the initial lock will sometimes take quite bit of time but subsequent locks shouldnt be nearly as bad
5780 from my experience opera mini is faster opera mobile is slow however if you are too conscious about security use mobile instead
5804 size opera mobile is 20mb opera mini is barely 900kb rendering opera mobile downloads html from web server and renders the website on your phone opera mini downloads an optimized version in operas binary markup language obml of the website from operas proxy opera mobile is more resource hungry on opera mini many of the rendering task is done on the proxy server which cuts the amount of processing bandwidth and memory requirement data usage opera mini downloads obml opera binary markup language from operas server which compresses pages by up to according to opera opera mobile downloads the whole webpage from the original site which can amount to quite bit of bandwidth note that opera mobile can also use opera turbo which can also reduce bandwidth usage last checked zooming in and out and rotating the screen in opera mini wouldnt reflow the text opera mobile has full javascript support opera mini only supports very limited subset of javascript in short opera mini is much faster and much leaner which is especially noticeable on less powerful devices and on slow networks however opera mini is not full featured browser and is never meant to be opera mini is much faster on slower network and slower phones opera mobile is full featured browser it has full javascript it connects to websites directly instead of going through operas server and it is usable to access intranet websites that operas proxy server cannot access
5831 an application like locale 99usd will let you do that at say am you can adjust the brightness to one setting then add another condition to adjust the brightness to different setting at different time tasker should be able to do it as well it does lot of what locale does plus more it also supports all the locale plug ins it is also about 99usd
5860 how about advancedbrightness its not automatic youd have to configure it accordingly however since you said adjust throughout the day this may well be suitable app for your needs oh and its free and very small 33kb
5888 if im understanding your question correctly youre asking how to get root access automatically when you run adb shell so that you dont have to go into the shell and type su to execute command as root on your phone this is controlled by flag in your boot partition which most custom roms have modified to allow root permission by default if you get dropped to when you use adb shell then you have two permanent options and one temporary one temporary meaning that it doesnt stick if you reboot flash rom that includes the modification create custom boot img and flash it to your phone restart adbd on your device with root permissions number is actually not that difficult but it can be somewhat dangerous if youre careless there is wiki article here which explains the process and includes couple of perl scripts to help you these instructions assume linux unix environment have personally used these instructions on fedora linux and can tell you that they work but do not know about other nix environments like macs also do not know of any similar windows instructions but could try to track some down if you are on windows the exact commands will vary somewhat from phone to phone since different devices use different partition tables generally speaking though you need to pull your current boot img from your phone unpack it extract the ramdisk and find the default prop file this is plaintext file which you need to open in text editor and then find the line that contains the value ro secure if the line says ro secure then you need to change it to ro secure after that you can re pack the ramdisk and boot img then flash it to your phone once you reboot you will be greeted with prompt whenever you perform adb shell without having to run su alternatively if you are using custom rom but it doesnt have this modification you can just unzip the rom and modify the boot img that is included with it using the above steps then you can zip up the rom with the newly modified boot img and flash the zip file as you normally would this probably goes without saying but be careful when doing this messing with your boot partition can quite easily wreck your phone and force you to recover via hboot would highly recommend testing fastboot to makes sure you can use extended fastboot commands and perform recovery this varies bit based on your model but most phones have some sort of desktop software that can be run to reflash the phone as well the third option is that in many cases it may be possible to restart adbd on your device with root privileges one possibility is to execute adb root from pc terminal although this will not work on all rom configurations the rom must be built as userdebug one you can also try chainfires adbd insecure app this will not persist across reboot so you would need to use either the app or adb root again any time you restarted your phone
5958 if you are using profile application to set your volumes in different situations guest most of them have the option of changing your screen timeout as well in my case im using setting profiles and can add new profile that does exactly that in two key press in setting profiles there is widget to set profiles and you can even select timer with the profiles you set for instance to enable the profile no screen timeout for the next minutes
5963 tasker is great app for this it can change the screen timeout value to whatever you need depending on phone state there are several from phone orientation to specific app being active for instance have it set to change the screen timeout value to hours when it is in navigation mode you can also define this task in tasker and create widget for it

6010 rooted phones are just as secure as an unrooted phones if you never grant root permission to any apps the problem is that if you root your phone youre bound to give root permission otherwise why are you rooting your phone in the first place and applications that you give root permission may turned out to be rogue or leak their permission to allow an untrusted applications to gain root like permission running rooted phone is safe as long as you know which app to give root access and which are not problem is even assuming that you only pick trustworthy apps they still can leak permissions inadvertantly in security parlance this is called confused deputy problem so you must really be careful when choosing trusted apps

6049 cant speak for the google voice app being fully integrated only use it for the voicemail feature however have fully rooted evo fresh rom and still have access to the market and all the normal google android apps in fact find that rooting gives me more features like free wireless tether and with fresh the power manager is integrated into the notification drop down which find really cool google voice still works perfectly for voice mail as far as know the only limitation is the one you have listed it will void the warranty however if something goes wrong there is huge community over at xda to help you out or you can unroot and see what happens when you bring your device in to sprint havent had to do this yet so cant speak on that part rooting for me has also made my battery life way better and gotten rid of those sprint apps that dont want edit cant comment on eldarerathiss post otherwise this would have gone there had forgotten about hardware limitations of using aosp roms like cm eldarerathis is correct though that with certain roms hdmi and 4g wont work when had the htc hero and first loaded cm think the camera didnt work but in time this was fixed and this is why have avoided the cm rom so far for my evo if you want the htc sense experience though dont go with cm or aosp roms these are essentially stock android hope this helps
6052 you might be thinking of the limitations on roms that are based on the android open source project aosp such as cyanogenmod the difficulty for these developers is that they dont have access to the source code for some of the device drivers of the evo and use only code that is available from the aosp as well as home built modifications and code of course these drivers are also closely coupled with htcs proprietary sense ui which was contributing factor to some of the difficulties the big dealbreakers for these have always been wimax 4g and hdmi output these have actually seen lot of development as of late however for instance you can get an alpha test version of cm7 which supports wimax now personally run this on my evo and it has been very stable albeit buggy in few fairly trivial ways its definitely fine for daily use at this point and have been using it since it came out without any actual issues its also slated as feature for the final release of cm7 hdmi is very different beast and didnt see as much development from the start because there was seemingly less demand for it however few pictures have been posted by devs recently that seem to indicate that progress might be gaining momentum one such picture can be found here if you flash custom rom that is based on an htc rom then these concerns essentially go away the basic rule of thumb is that any sense ui rom will support both wimax and hdmi out and any aosp rom will not excepting the recent test versions of cm7 also cyanogenmod doesnt come with googles applications pre installed due to licensing issues they are permitted to distribute separate package however so you just have to flash them separately after you flash the rom itself beyond that everything else functions as normal and many additional things become possible with root
6056 this wont answer your question for google maps specifically but have you tried using an offline map application such as mapdroyd would that suit your needs you download the entire map beforehand and therefore wouldnt have to use your data to view the map
6065 if you install file manager app like astro file manager you can put any files into any directory you create including pictures then all you have to do is make shortcut to that directory on the home screen
6070 know an answer has already been accepted but just wanted to add that you can also use es file explorer am not the developer just know some prefer it to astro however you must download the es bookmark manager in order for it to work in order to create the shortcut just long click on folder from within the app and select shortcut from the context menu shortcut to that folder will appear on your home screen if you dont already have the bookmark manager installed it will prompt you to download it from the market hope this helps
6077 found that number saver is the closest to solution it adds an icon to the notification area when on call and will even automatically switch to speakers when run during call
6089 this depends on the phone youre using on my spica for example can use the directional keypad to adjust the position of the cursor on phones that have trackballs the trackball does the same job otherwise the backspace key can be used as workaround for left arrow key delete few chars then retype the word youre inserting and retype the deleted chars another alternative if youre typing in english or in one of the supported languages you can try swype swype is word based text input as opposed to character based and you typically delete or swipe one word at time and the correction mode double tap on the word you want to correct and pick or swipe the new word make correcting errors breeze
6090 in froyo and later there is cursor handle that you can grab and drag to the right location now this photo doesnt show it but the actual cursor is still there blinking too that handle will also bring up quick action menu to select text or paste and once text is selected you can copy and cut too
6119 one open source remote security app is prey although dont think it does remote wipe
6121 for non rooted phones up until it is not possible regular apps do not have the permission to perform full wipes or factory restores believe there are apps that erase your call sms records and your contacts starting with it seems google is granting limited root powers to apps that use device administration it is supposedly way for enterprises to policy their employees phones and requires an extra confirmation by the owner but believe it could be used by anyone writing an app in fact the code for wiping seems so simple that think you could write an open source app yourself if you have some programming background for rooted phones there are remote wipe apps but dont believe any of them is open source that ive heard of remote wipe for root users is possibly the simplest one and its in the market but ive never tried it myself this app is no longer on the market
6181 providing this as an answer for those who dont want to install custom rom and want something close to the stock soft keyboard installed anysoft keyboard found it on this question the android market doesnt have the current screenshots but heres one that shows the small left right arrows at the top of the keyboard
6202 well this is very subjective because it depends what youre doing first of all true multitasking having multiple apps run requires faster cpu so that all the processes can run at decent speed you are right that for all these apps to remain in memory you need more ram have mb ram and my processes only start getting killed if run something that uses ton like angry birds on the other hand have ghz processor and never notice slowdowns regardless of what im doing apart from angry birds bogging itself down during long plays if youre doing email twitter facebook web etc then you probably want more ram if you want to play games then you need decent amount of ram but the processor and graphics chip is going to be more important in general another important consideration is speed if you have samsung phone that uses rfs install an ext4 lagfix youll notice huge improvement if youre recording hd video you may want faster sd card we have questions about that and so on storage size is largely unrelated to performance but youll want to consider that as well many users kick themselves after installing few apps and finding that theyve run out of space highly recommend device like my vibrant which has an excessive gb internal system data storage and gb internal sd plus the external sd card
6204 keep on top of your apps deleting the ones you dont use and the ones that are poorly coded resource hogs clear individual apps caches in settings applications manage applications by choosing clear cache reboot your device periodically have no evidence to back up that this improves performance but it seems to work for me this answer is community wiki so feel free to add or amend
6209 here is some performance tips have plenty of extra space in the internal memory the phone uses the internal memory to store apks and caches if you have very little internal memory it might make it difficult for the phone to find contiguous area large enough to store and load the cache while flash based storage are not as badly affected by fragmentation as disk based storage there will still be major performance hit if the apks or cache file is fragmented into pieces you should not need to clear caches the caches are needed for the best performance of the phone if you clear caches and you have performance improvement thats just because youve made an extra space and that makes it easier for new programs to create and load their caches while you might be happy with this it is only temporary fix until the program rebuilds the cache and it becomes sluggish again best way to resolve this situation is to keep an amount of empty space about of the internal memory the optimal figure depends on the size of your internal memory do not install too many programs and uninstall programs you do not use this way you prevent program you do not use to build caches you do not use prefer small programs which generally produces smaller caches avoid app2sd for applications you frequently use unless you have class or higher sd card put only big applications that you do not use frequently on sd card games homescreen keyboard and widgets should be in the internal memory for best performance android prevents you from installing them on sd card but it is not impossible to force move them to sd avoid program that have background services and avoid home screen widgets while there are valid reasons for programs to spawn background service music player im etc and while some home screen widgets are very useful they can degrade performance if you have too many of them background service and home screen widgets will eat up rams that the os cannot reclaim as easily as sleeping applications android usually will reclaim memory from unused applications first but only in very dire circumstances that it kills background services and home screen this is not an outright ban on background services and home screen widgets just to be bit conservative in the use of widgets since no os in the world can smoothly run more programs than it was designed to handle
6210 in phone most of the programs you will use are thinks like email im web browser this kind of apps does not need powerful cpu but given the fact that you will be using an android phone you will be running multiple applications at the same time which needs some extra cpu time but more importantly needs enough ram memory to accommodate all the applications so more than one or the other the important thing in and android phone balance with 2ghz cpu and 512mb of ram you will be wasting cpu power because the phone will not have enough memory to accommodate sufficient applications to consume that amount of cpu cycles the same occurs with 500mhz cpu and 2gb or ram the processor will not have enough cycles to execute enough applications to consume that amount of ram so balance is the thing to consider cpu at 1ghz with to 1gb of ram is great combination the same goes for 600mhz with 256mb to 512mb little underpowered for recent versions of andorid or for new two cores 1ghz cpu with 712mb or more of ram given this considerations my recommendation will be to search for phone with 1ghz or more cpu and 1gb or more of ram this phone will be powerful enough to run all the applications you will need in the next years that is the maximum period of time you will be using the phone giving the evolution rate of the mobile technology
6215 in the context of android more ram means android can keep more sleeping program in the ram so they will be ready to be quickly resumed when you return back to the apps more ram means android is going to spend less of its time killing and reloading apps from the internal memory sd card and instead spend more time doing actual work you care about this means that more ram usually give you better faster task switching also more ram means your homescreen is less likely to be killed and you wont experience that second wait that feels like forever having more ram also allows you to run complex apps that naturally requires lot of memory photo video editor complex games etc higher cpu is able to calculate things much faster while this might look tempting at first it is notable that most programs except for games and synthetic benchmark and possibly flash heavy webpages are bound and not cpu bound in other word most programs are waiting for network transmission flash storage reads dma reads touch event processing etc to finish instead of waiting for some calculations in cpu bound application increasing cpu speed can mean less latency between touching the screen and the screen updating to reflect the touch event however up to certain point there will be no longer any noticeable benefit of adding even more cpu beyond certain point the input turnaround will be much faster than our own brains turnaround time approx 200ms and we will not be able to perceive the benefit of adding even faster cpu also note that input to output turnaround time depends on large number of other factors the latency of the cables speed of the bus etc second having some extra cpu time to spare also means that android can assign those spare cpu cycles to background processes so background processes can run better summary more ram better task switching can run more complicated apps or open larger more complex files more cpu faster turnaround between input and response less lag on cpu bound apps better background processing in short both are equally important your own personal usage pattern will determine which is more valuable for you if you generally stays in single program and is sensitive to input to output latency then having faster cpu will be more valuable for you if you constantly task switch between many different apps or if you need to run complex memory hungry apps to open complex large files then having extra ram is going to be more valuable to you
6234 for galaxy devices you can simply enter about useragent into your browsers url bar dont think this sticks across reboots but its relatively painless to do and doesnt require extra software hacks etc dont own galaxy so im not keen on some of the specifics if about useragent doesnt work then other phones can typically to this instead enter about debug into the url bar to activate debug mode in the browser you wont see any kind of confirmation that this has worked go into menu more settings and scroll all the way to the bottom you should see new menu item called uastring tap the uastring menu option and select different user agent from the provided menu have ie6 mac desktop and linux desktop as options for mine all of which give me full versions of websites see also this question with info on some of the goodies in debug mode the about debug menu also works on honeycomb or later but the menu is organized little differently you enter about debug the same way then go into the settings and youll find new settings tab on the left simply named debug uastring is one of the first options in this tab
6259 on my htc desire running have an option under the stock browser menu more settings called mobile view which enables mobile versions of web pages for example with this this enabled get the mobile version of tumblr with it disabled get the full site
6269 no as you might know eclipse has various problems running in different flavors of linux which is why ubuntu has an official repository version of it and all that android is even worse while based on linux its completely different operating system similar question would be is is possible to install nix version of eclipse in mac os
6270 no is the short answer the android os is built on the linux kernel there are lot of differences between the android os and the average linux distro and some of these differences are critical to installing eclipse
6303 to expand bit on the previous no answers its not just the kernel but the rest of the os which makes big difference applications developed for linux expect certain set of libraries shared bits of code to exist and do what the application expects they also sometimes expect certain filesystem structure and other dependencies not all linux distributions include the same libraries filesystem layout or have other differences thats why youll often see linux applications distributed as tar gz file with script to compile it yourself that makes it bit more cross platform some executables like command line utilities can be cross compiled to work on android because they dont have as many complex requirements as big complex application like eclipse androids different enough that there arent yet straightforward ways to compile standard linux gui applications to work on it
6326 root explorer has an excellent search function

6336 this was fixed in froyo anything over characters will convert to an mms prior to froyo you do have couple options use 3rd party messaging app like handcent for example see if you are able to install this hack root your phone and flash froyo rom wait for froyo update from samsung edit some additional information anything over characters technically is no longer an sms the stock messaging app and others too allow for longer messages but it is just splitting up the messages in to characters in eclair android message will be converted to an mms after it exceeds characters at that point the default messaging app will no longer split up the messages instead it just sends it as one mms if you are using 3rd party messaging application and find that you are still being charged the mms rate it may be that your carrier is grouping messages that come through at the same time
6354 use handcent and change the default settings settings send message settings auto convert to mms uncheck this split set this to one of the split options recommend split by word add counter but you may prefer different one dont fully understand the differences between them all

6437 to windows user mass storage means the fat32 bit remainder of the sd card after partitioning the ext partition wont be visible to windows normally the ext partition will be used by some some the store my apps on the sd card implementations some use fat32 some use ext2 ext3 ext4 for the latter it is an extension of your internal storage with some caveats personally dont use partition have the custom oxygen good for cm7 too think hboot from alphrev nl of course this may not be everyones cup of tea so you can partition it using rom manager or one of the custom recoveries anomra clockworkmod etc or use linux live cd to partition it manually rather than from your phone
6438 im on rooted samsung spica running the stock samsung eclair version since my internal memory was limited to around mb was hunting around for simple enough solution and preferably freeware have an gb card and imo allotting gb would be more than adequate for all the games apps that id want to keep for posterity but couldnt afford to occupy space within the limited internal memory that had enter link2sd its freeware and works with android and above you will also need partitioning tool used the excellent freeware easeus partition manager epm to ensure no data was erased during the repartitioning resizing first download and install epm pop your storage card into your card reader start epm your card should be visible amongst the other drives partitions in your pc select the partition on your card it should cover the entire length by default right click choose resize move and then reduce the partition size this is what shows in windows until the unallocated space size is of suitable size the unallocated space will be allocated as the partition on which your apps will be stored click ok an aside even though link2sd supports the usage of the second partition in which your apps will reside created in the fat fat32 format windows only recognizes the first primary partition which is why this newly created partition wont show within windows inspite of it being fat fat32 we shall be using either ext2 ext3 or ext4 as the file system in any case onward right click this new unallocated space and choose create click yes on the warning that describes what ive said above now in the partition label type in label like androidapps or whatever suits you this is critical the create as should be primary choose file system as ext3 and click ok click apply in the main windows top left corner big blue check mark icon epm will carry out the operations congrats youve just re partitioned your card and without any data loss too hopefully assuming youve installed link2sd in your phone and the sd card has been re inserted reboot your phone start link2sd and it should detect your partition list of apps is now displayed click the app you want to move to the card and then click create link thats it
6449 this is pretty much just matter of preference to be honest dont think youll really lose any functionality on desire by going to an aosp based rom either or otherwise you should gain built in usb and wifi tethering though since those are standard part of android the real deciding factor will just be if you prefer the sense ui or another launcher adw launcherpro zeam etc you will lose any htc widgets since they depend on sense but there are widgets in the market which actually mimic the style and functionality of the htc ones for just that reason you also lose htcs proprietary apps since they generally use the sense framework in various ways threads pop up on xda from time to time where people argue over whether sense is better than other launchers but it almost inevitably just amounts to each group saying think better than because like the way it looks
6455 have to disagree with eldarerathis ive never used sense but the number of problems people have with it indicate to me that it is inferior on reliability level while vanilla android is not perfect either would certainly trust it more
6461 to create such malicious launcher it will need to disable settings applications manage applications disable settings applications development usb debugging disable market to prevent you from downloading home switcher apps prevent all other launcher type application from opening otherwise you can just start the other launcher and go to settings from there disable terminal emulator type application to prevent uninstallation by pm or rm ing the apk others this seems like gaping security hole in android no no when security experts talks about system having good security they dont talk about stupid user doing stupid thing to his system stupid user giving untrusted program unwarranted privileges are social problems not security problem linux and android is secure not because it is impossible mess the system up you can very easily just type sudo rm rf linux is secure because malicious program cannot mess up the system without the users authorization and user cannot mess the system up unless they have the appropriate privilege to mess up the system user with root privilege can mess up the system in thousands of ways unlike in some other os linux and android does not attempt to protect the user from doing something stupid since such protection would also prevent power users from doing anything smart it will blindly follow your order when you told it to destroy itself as long as the user has the privilege to command the system to destroy itself the following sudos first time sudoers lecture sums up the unix linux way to security we trust you have received the usual lecture from the local system administrator it usually boils down to these three things respect the privacy of others think before you type with great power comes great responsibility in any case if such malicious launcher comes into the market we can be sure that google will remove it from market immediately with no delay and probably issue remote uninstall command and if you install such launcher from outside market then you are not typical user you are responsible for your own if youre installing programs from outside market

6486 my answer focuses bit more on the sense vs no sense see the bottom part for links about vs currently have sense based rom on my evo and cyanogenmod on my old hero now there are differences in the devices so that must be taken into account but here is what have found on my hero had sense based rom for long time and liked it kinda prefer sense when tried aosp roms they tended to be faster and give me better battery life but from time to time would cause my hero to reboot when got tired of this went back to sense based rom it was slow but never reboot on me eventually got tired of the slowness and went back to cyanogenmod for the hero the other thing liked about cyanogenmod was the photos app that would grab photos from picasas web albums didnt like that the sense widgets and sense apps like the clock widget and app with all the integrated functionality were gone and the keyboard was the stock one personally prefer the htc keyboard now as eldarerathis already mentioned you can find similar replacements for the widgets and apps but in my attempts nothing found was perfect you may find that different on my evo have only tried sense rom have excellent battery life all the sense functionality and with the rom im using fresh there is an app added that will allow you to add the google apps clock photos etc or the aosp lock screen have the wireless and usb tether that eldarerathis mentioned as well and as he already mentioned the merits of google maps cant say that have tried any roms for the desire either sense or aosp but here is link to the cyanogenmod forum for the desire if you wanted to see what other people are experiencing with that rom here are some links that explain some differences between and breaking them down my feature sets http www differencebetween com difference between android froyo and android gingerbread http www bizzntech com android gingerbread vs froyo
6504 if you have an sd card would copy its contents to pc that should save all of your pictures paid apps are linked to your google account and can always be re downloaded have you entered your contacts manually and not synced them to your google account if not you dont need to back them up theyre in the cloud to use the common catchphrase if youre rooted you can use an app like titanium backup to save your applications and data so that you dont need to redownload them and so your settings saved games etc are backed up
6505 your contacts and calendar will be stored in the cloud and synced back when you re login with the same google account also most of your settings apps that you purchased will be listed in your market account suggest you use sms backup or something similar to save your messages if you wish to to your storage card gosms and handcent sms also have sms backup restore facility by default your camera pics are stored in the dcim folder on your storage card use backup app like titanium backup or mybackup pro to backup all the stuff first just as an additional safety net note busy right now so havent added links quick search will turn up the apps in the market

6530 find moving the cursor to particular place in some text far more accurate using the trackball than trying to select it by prodding the touchscreen would say that there might not be specific use case which cant be accomplished using only the touchscreen but that there are certainly tasks for which using the trackball is easier its all probably quite subjective though and depends on user preference
6539 wager that it was way to attract blackberry users
6543 for that those particular pieces of malware the answer is probably yes factory reset does not completely undo rooting especially with the more invasive methods used for few hard to root devices simple common exploit like the ones probably used in these rogue apps is less likely to allow them to persist factory reset should also wipe out installed apps including the malicious ones or if theyre stored on the sd card or something at least reduce them to uninstalled apps just sitting there and they cant do anything unless the user reinstalls them factory resets generally leave the system partition intact however and any malware could theoretically have replaced system binaries with malicious versions or something along those lines to be on the safe side you would want to re flash your rom and not just do factory reset
6545 beside moving the cursor in textbox its also nice as blinking orb of information for mine if its blinking blue have tweet waiting and if its purple thats google voice message etc and it blinks red and then blue and then green have three things waiting armed with that kind of information can make decision about if it worth getting the stare of death from my wife if pick it up at dinnertime what really need is to have it blinking red if new angry birds is available at the market
6547 adding to what matthew read stated it most likely will not unroot but on top of that it will not stop the damage that it has already done with your contacts or data mean if it collected contact data and personal passwords ect then you need to start changing passwords and all that good stuff

6679 believe that matthew read is correct about there being no native way to sync this and about locales ability to work around this but im going to suggest some cheaper and simpler alternatives to the locale app tasker basically the same as locale but cheaper with this and probably locale you could set profile that turns on autosync for only minutes and repeats this every hour or whatever timeframe you want also tasker can use locale plugins juicedefender free ive used it before although never tried what you are trying to do and its super easy to setup and use it allows you to control total connectivity and app by app connectivity control it also claims to allow you to schedule synchronization events which ive never tried by sounds like it would control general and app specific syncing sync schedule free dont think this will be as useful as the name suggests but if all else fails its worth shot it allows you to set times for the autosync to turn off and on but im not sure if it lets you set multiple time windows per day so this may be of limited use also regarding your is there any way to make it pause when actually want to use the phone question the native android power control widget has an autosync as one of the options allowing you to toggle it on off at will
6820 am great fan of app2sd it comes directly with an advice which apps can be moved to your sd and if the cache can be removed
6855 yes you have to root your phone in order to remove preinstalled apps see these questions here and here before you remove any applications make sure you make backup via nandroid you may delete an app that the system relies on for one reason or other do some searching and make sure it is safe to remove the apps you want to remove
6856 yes you have to be rooted to get rooted see this question how do root my android device one of the easiest ways to uninstall system apps after rooting is to use titanium backup you can just click an app and choose uninstall note be careful what you remove you might want to use titanium to back them up before you remove them in case it makes your phone unstable or stop working also note that the bootloader may restore system apps on reboot if possible unlock your bootloader you may also need to install custom rom thats deodexed or to edit the image that is restored by the bootloader that depends on your particular device but with the sgs you should have no bootloader related problems
6926 dex file is basically compiled bytecode version of an app that has been built for the dalvik vm which androids apps run on believe it is short for dalvik executable but im not sure if im remembering that correctly an odex file is an optimized dex file hence the meaning that it has basically been pre compiled for specific platform the advantage to this is that startup time is much faster since the vm doesnt have to perform any optimizing at startup runtime the disadvantages are that it takes up some extra space and an odexed app wont run properly if its put onto another device and it must have the associated odex file to run at all roms are typically released in deodexed form because they can be themed and modified fairly easily whereas theming modifying an odexed rom is basically impossible at best things would crash like crazy some people also choose to release their roms in odexed versions for people who would prefer the performance gains most of the stock roms ive seen are odexed assume because the carriers manufacturers want the performance boost they also dont have any kind of official theming methods so they probably dont care if you cant change the colors of your status icons or your system text or whatnot plus they have the advantage of knowing what device they want their system to run on so they can pre compile the odex files very easily imagine as an added bonus it makes it difficult to pull apk files off of the device and share them with people edit since just realized that was not very explicit about the difference here an odexed rom is one where the apps have been precompiled and thus contain associated odex files which are external to the apk files deodexed rom is one where data that would be optimized in the odex files has been more or less merged back into the apk files meaning it is not optimized but basically platform agnostic thus the apk files are self contained and there are no odex files this is usually just done with deodexing utility such as smali baksmali
6963 would suggest using dropbox the interface lets you upload or download files on an android device additionally you can manage the files from any computer with dropbox installed on it ive been big fan of using dropbox on my droid
6970 there seems to be multiple options available with relevant internet search there is an application called bump which shares files by simply bumping both devices together im not sure if it does it over wifi if available or only does it over 3g there is another option where you can set up an ftp server on the device using an application called swiftp which is not being maintained anymore but the last update was june you can install this on one device and use es file explorer on the other device to compress and upload the file it using the ftp option third option would be use hoccer which probably uses their service as dropbox does though cant be sure id personally recommend the ftp solution since that seems the most straight forward and you get to ensure that you have direct connection
6982 four ways upgrading the software fixing the hardware resetting the gps settings data and using fake gps upgrading the software samsung definitely released some bad gps firmware which does not help things fortunately good code is included in all of the recent updates if you can upgrade your software to it has many advantages besides just the gps you can also try flashing gps code see this xda thread apparently its the best yet and should work with any rom summary gingerbread great froyo good eclair bad note minority of users have worse gps performance after upgrading to froyo if you have the very latest froyo update and this is true for you believe you can fix it by continuing with the other steps below or the gps code above you probably have bad gps data and settings left over from eclair or perhaps its just that your phone has been cold started and the gps needs to collect some information about the nearby satellites first fixing the hardware this might void your warranty though if done properly it should be undetectable major problem for many users is yes hardware problem but not gps chip issue as some have claimed was reluctant to accept this myself but after trying everything else finally resorted to this fix and it worked the hardware has apparently been fixed in newer device versions so if you bought your phone after october recommend trying the other steps before doing this but the good news is that its easy to do theres detailed guide on xda here is the quick version take off the back cover remove the battery sim and sd card remove the small screws in the back of the device and carefully pry off the backing plastic youll see gold ish contacts sticking out approximately at each corner of the device youll notice that the backing plastic has flat contacts on it which are supposed to touch the ones on the device see the guide for details slightly bend the contacts on the device upwards millimeter or so should be good dont overdo it so that they will contact the backing plate like they were intended to you might want to insert something like small folded piece of paper under the contact so that it doesnt bend back down put everything back together and continue with the next section fixing the hardware 2nd option this really voids your warranty but seems like the best possible technical fix so far problem is caused by bad gnd conductivity between mainboard and antenna it is conduced by conductivity rubber this kind of rubber was used for old nokia for connect display to mainboard it was the mayor fault for nokia there are different methods which both require soldering skill but are said to significantly improve the gps signal read more see photos and step by step guide on xda reset the gps data and settings start up the phone shut off gps and install gpsrestore alternate non market link and captivate sgs tools dont worry for our purposes it works for all sgs models open the sgs tools and from the secret codes menu go into gps test and settings lbstestmode hit delete gps data run gpsrestore suggest running it with gps off first letting step fail then going outside turning gps on and running it again it may take minutes while your phone searches for satellites and figures out where it is this cold start should prep your phone with good data and future locks should be much quicker once the test is done you should be good to go recommend only trying the following if your gps is still slow or doesnt work after trying everything else in most situations the default server is fine go into supl cp settings in lbstestmode as above and change server to supl google com port install gpstest go outside turn on your gps and open the app wait for lock again this might take some time using fake gps even the best gps doesnt lock on instantly you can use assisted gps or agps to help get rough fix quickly while you wait for the more accurate gps to get lock this only works when you have internet access since it uses your ip address to locate you go into your devices gps settings settings location and security and make sure use wireless networks and use sensor aiding are both checked use gps satellites should of course be checked also note this might make things worse in situations where the phone relies on the inaccurate agps more than the real gps experiment with and without it and thats it hope this guide works for you and you enjoy your newly functional gps
7084 it only takes one time fee of for developer to start putting apps on the market no hoops to jump through and you can publish as many applications as you want instantly no waiting no queues no approval process nada however there have been few cases of malicious applications when these problems arise google usually pulls them from the market and from users phones it doesnt happen very often android was designed to to keep yourself protected all applications have to ask for permissions to do certain things make calls read contact data access the internet etc read the permissions before you install an application make sure you know and understand what it is going to be doing does it seem to have dubious permission that it asks for access to however at the same time dont berate the developer because of certain permissions some ads ran in apps require at least the internet permission and sometimes some other ones about the phone state believe be sure to have thorough understanding of why developer would need certain permissions most importantly read what other people are saying about the application in the market read some of the comments although beware that the comments on the android market are the same level as youtube in terms of quality and see what the apps rating is have you heard of the app before has blog mentioned or reviewed it worse case scenario if you arent rooted then no single application should be able to damage your phone as every application is sandboxed from each other technically each developers set of applications are sandboxed from each other apps signed by the same developer key can have access to other apps signed by the same developer they could potentially steal your data depending on the amount of permissions the application is given the rarest scenario can think of is if an application uses an exploit to enable root access on your phone and then does something malicious delete everything
7100 bought an anchor tabled last week and using my google account was able to download the application bought on my samsung galaxy phone without any problems so think from my experience you can download the same software again as long as its coupled with the same google account
7106 after flashing cyanogenmod to my phone visited play store and logged in and it showed all of my apps still installed on my phone before the flash didnt use any app backup software clicked on each of my apps and clicked the install button and they all came over to my phone properly including the few paid apps have this leads me to believe that android doesnt prevent the same apps including paid apps from being installed on more than one device so long as they are both associated with the same google account
7138 the us nexus has super amoled but lot of manufactures are moving to super lcd for the screens because of the super amoled shortages even the galaxy is supposed to have super lcd from an engadget article comparing the two there really is no clear winner between slcd and amoled when it comes to picture quality the former offers sharper picture plus more realistic color reproduction whereas the latter shows off brighter more vibrant colors but as we concluded earlier amoled seems to be slightly ahead of the game with its power efficiency now am not really sure if there is big difference between amoled and super amoled but as you can see visually there isnt much of difference between amoled and super lcd super amoled is going to produce darker black as super amoled doesnt transmit any light at all when displaying black which helps on battery
7139 as ryan has pointed out there isnt that much of difference between super amoled and super lcd screens chances are you will be hard pressed to see the colour difference unless you have two mobiles side by side or at least the difference is small enough it shouldnt really be an issue from what ive read where the two differ are battery usage amoled uses less power thus longer use of the phone on one battery charge screen glare under the sun lcd screens believe have less glare and are more readable compared to the standard amoled supposedly the super amoled has improved from the amoled and is more readable under the sun too edit it seems like super amoled has indeed improved compared to amoled according to engadget super amoled is now similar to lcd both are slightly more visible than amoled under the sun super amoled amoled lcd screens left to right
7153 you can install droid to get market style repository of free and open source android apps http droid org
7196 im not familiar with the samsung galaxy but in general if you want to install an aftermarket os you need to root your phone and in general rooting your phone will void the warranty do you have other reasons for wanting to change the os or is it really just touchwiz according to this xda post the only touchwiz free rom is cyanogenmod its very unstable on the galaxy though however you can install different launcher such as launcherpro touchwiz will still be on the phone but just in the background so you can have more stock android experience by using another launcher hope ive answered your intial question dont hesitate to ask new questions about how to go about disabling touchwiz if you do opt to go that route
7201 yes flashing custom rom will void your warranty however it is very simple to revert to the stock rom with galaxy for warranty purposes rooting will also void your warranty but the method below does not require root the easiest way to get new os for galaxy is to use odin for windows download here search for heimdall if you want to do this on linux you just need an odin flashable rom for the galaxy vibrant highly recommend the rom currently use bionix v1 which has touchwiz free version assume you have gt i9000 however you should look for one that suits your purposes in xdas i9000 android development forum edit according to this post the only completely touchwiz free rom is cyanogenmod which is unstable buggy so if you dont want cm and just want to replace the launcher you can do that without flashing another rom as amanda says in her answer otherwise you can continue with the instructions below for using odin once you have the rom do the following put your phone into download mode remove the battery if non i9000 attach the phone to your pc via usb hold volumedown plus either the home key i9000 or volumeup non i9000 and the power button reinsert the battery let go of the power button only about second after the white device logo appears if it does after few seconds yellow triangle with an android in it should appear you can let go of the keys since this is download mode start up odin if non i9000 detatch your phone from usb attach the phone to usb so that odin recognizes it load the zip file you downloaded the custom rom into the pda field of odin load the pit file into the pit field of odin check re partition hit start odin will tell you when its done if it fails reboot your phone and try again this happens occasionally note that if you need to back anything up you should do that beforehand and save the backup to your pc since everything except probably the external sd card will be wiped on the phone also note that you do this at your own risk odin is very powerful and misusing it can damage your phone ive used it dozens of times myself safely
7204 the norm definitely seems to be for developers to update their app and those who have already paid for it will also receive the update however this is definitely not enforced in any way shape or form unless you have contract stating otherwise and you ensure its enforced you only get what you pay for the current version of the app and thats it the developer can easily choose to upload the new version as different app and expect old users who want to upgrade to pay for it
7211 if the developer keeps releasing updates to the app as the same packagename and you already purchased the application previously then should receive updates for the application for free if you went and purchased my app then you should get updates so long as keep updating this specific packagename of the app net mandaria cardashboardpro however could at some point in the future decide that want more money for the application and release newer version of the application under new packagename net mandaria cardashboarddeluxe you would not get free update to this app even if it is technically the same application have chosen to release it as separate app in the eyes of the android market which determines two applications to be different solely by their package name however could still charge you for more money by including optional in app purchases or subscriptions that did not previously exist without changing the package name carrying the same example could still use net mandaria cardashboardpro but have an in app purchase for the deluxe features most developers will not do these things to users who have already purchased their application but it isnt impossible once such example of developer trying to charge for newer version of his application was psx4droid the backlash was so vicious from his users that he went back and updated the older version of his app to the newer version version he now has to maintain three versions because of this version and plus free version instead of two talk about developer headache so ultimately it depends on what the developer decides to do in the majority of cases the developer will keep supporting the same app and you receive the latest updates for free after your purchase
7223 check out this guys post on xda http forum xda developers com showpost phpp postcount this might be considered risky solution but if you arent using the 3g connection at all and youre careful to simply rename the apks he references you might just disable the cell radio without needing to use airplane mode in case the link doesnt work he suggests using root explorer to rename phone apk to phone apk bak and telephony apk to telephony apk bak thus disabling these two packages you have to reboot your phone to finalize the changes if it doesnt work you should remove the bak from each file name and they should be available again at ops request summary of his findings phone apk is the dialer app which is responsible for the cell radio phonetelephony apk turns out to be just the dialer storage which we can kill just to save more memory androidos immediately restarts dialer when it is closed so renaming it will cause problems but after battery yank reboot everything is ok it also gets rid of the annoying activate your phone dialog that comes up on every boot btw the dialpad still comes up after getting rid of dialer
7259 there are number of differences between the two marketplaces and while advantages may be somewhat subjective there are few specific features that the amazon app store has that the market place does not amazon claims to test each app before making them available for download to ensure that each app works as outlined in the product description does not impair the functionality of the mobile device or put customer data at risk once installed they offer one paid app for free each day some apps have test drive feature on their website that allows you to try the app in virtualized android interface in your browser although cant seen to find an app that has this feature yet amazon is employing their recommendation engine to suggest apps you may like based on your purchase history it should be noted that at the moment the amazon app store only works in the us unless you are able to use us proxy in another country and the service is blocked on at devices
7268 there is program called angry birds backup on the market that allows you to back your progress up without having root access ive not tried it myself but ive heard good things you can read more about it on their web site at http www angrybackup com
7292 the pricing model is nice you can set list price they will sell the app for almost any price you will either get of list price or of sell price whichever is higher so occasionally they might give it for free and that increases your sales without losing revenue or they might sell for high price which is good if people ready to pay for it
7440 expanding little bit on ben griffths answer and martin tapankovs comment no you cant run eclipse on android because there isnt java runtime environment to run eclipse and there isnt build of the java development kit for android although most android apps are written in java android doesnt have jre android uses dalvik which is completely different runtime
7445 short answer yes it should act exactly like having second browser until you set it as your default android should prompt you to pick what client you want to use if you choose k9 as your default and then delete it android will be smart enough to revert back to the default client
7446 when you first install an application that can handle the same intent as another application install for the sake of this example lets say home launcher but this works for any similar apps then the first time youd press the home button which calls an intent to go to the home screen which you now have apps that could handle it youll get selection screen of applications that can fulfill that intent and youll have the option to set one of them as default if set an application as default and you no longer wish to use that application as default you can either uninstall the application or you can go to settings applications manage apps go to the app in particular and click on clear defaults this will reset the default application for that intent so the next time youd press the home button you would again get selection of home launchers to choose from
7454 update google play gift cards are now widely available in many countries thanks to chahk for reminding me to update amazon has released their own android appstore which allow you to send amazon gift cards that are redeemable for android apps this requires few extra steps but should let you gift what you want to until this function gets added to the original android market google play store
7471 another app is now available to be more complete solution titanium media sync the reliable and battery friendly way of syncing your files to from the cloud this unique app allows you to sync set of folders from your android device to the cloud and back it currently supports the free dropbox storage service the official dropbox app is not needed innovative setup forget sync engine with these features battery friendly works on all android devices will not slow down your device when no data changes will backup your new modified files eg photos videos in the background as soon as possible adapts to ever changing connectivity and power conditions supports different sync modes both are one way continuous sync from local to remote one shot sync from remote to local and from lifehackers review if youve been unhappy with the way dropboxs mobile app only uploads files manually youll want to check out titanium media sync which will constantly sync folders from your phone to dropbox just like dropbox does on the desktop from the makers of the amazing titanium backup titanium media sync is what dropboxs mobile app should have been you pick folders from your sd card to sync back to your dropbox any time you add something to those folders say if you take picture on your phone or download an app you want to try out on your computer later on it will automatically sync those changes back so your files will be waiting for you when you get back to your computer you can also sync folders from your dropbox to your sd card but its only one time sync titanium wont monitor your remote folders only the ones on your sd card the interface is pretty easy to use too the left column shows all the folders on your sd card while the column on the right shows your dropbox and you can just drag and drop folders from one to the other to sync them dragging from the the right column will download that folder to your sd card while dragging from left to right will give you the option of setting up that folder for automatic sync because it only syncs one way it wont constantly call the internet slow down your phone when its waiting for changes you can even set whether you want it to sync over wi fi only or over 3g and 4g in the preferences by default it will also sync only when your phones plugged in to save battery but you can change this in the preferences too seriously if youre dropbox user this app is absolutely worth having even moreso than the official dropbox app itself titanium media sync is download for android devices
7486 nice feature of the amazon app store is that it is tied to your amazon account not your google account this means if you have two phones with different gmail accounts in the same house you can share apps if they both log into the amazon app store with the same login on android market ive had to buy apps twice in that case
7492 from wikipedia 720p is the shorthand name for category of hdtv video modes having resolution of for total of megapixels or pixels and progressive scan the number stands for the horizontal scan lines of display resolution also known as pixels of vertical resolution while the letter stands for progressive scan or non interlaced when broadcast at frames per second 720p features the highest temporal motion resolution possible under the atsc and dvb standards the samsung galaxy is capable of recording 720p video from its rear facing camera the nexus is not max resolution of 720x480
7493 its referring to the resolution that the video camera can record video in 720p is high definition resolution apparently the maximum video resolution of the nexus is only 720x480 which is standard definition many new android handsets have the ability to record hd video which is why it would be something to complain about with the nexus
7496 ive been using droid which is smallish repository focused on free and open source tools not all encompassing by any means but one of the few that is explicit about showing you the license before you download an app edit by izzy droid is small but superb alternative to google play though it offers only about apps1 in its main repository they are mostly high quality in comparision these are some advantages it has over the playstore apps are opensource which means they are all free to support the devs there are donation buttons on each apps page droid compiles the packages from the sources this adds level of security as it makes sure nothing was sneaked into the draw back is you cannot simply cross update apps between the droid main repo and other sources compiling the sources themselves they also often throw out binary blobs and other unfree material included modules from proprietary sources in many cases this means the advertisement stuff being removed this again increases security and privacy but in some cases it has the draw back of some functionality being broken if the removed part was stuff enabling specific google services such as maps next to its main repository droid offers several others2 developers can provide their own channel for beta versions nice way also for companies or organizations to keep together groups of apps their members are supposed to use droid is very clear when it comes to anti features such as ads if an app in any way deviates from the opensource idea thats pointed out straight in colored boxes you cant miss when browsing the apps pages quoting bgvaughan from the comments droids preferences allow you to screen apps by various traits whether they contain advertising track your activity or promote non free add ons among others while miss the lack of user ratings on droid and droid app versions sometimes trail behind those on google play the fact that can be sure that anything on droid is free open source and not freaking pita is more than enough to recommend its use can also only approve what nicolas says about droid in his comment droid apps are guaranteed open source ad free tracking free that means smaller apps that dont waste your bandwidth for anti features droid also offers its own android client the droid application manager droid app source androidnext click for larger variant more details on droid can also be found at wikipedia interesting fact droid is fork of aptoide3 as of see also broams and daithib8s comments below and this list see wikipedia droid history
7587 would put it into the keyboards user dictionary there are few clipboard snippet manager application you might be interested if you need to store longer texts clipper text snippet lite ime
7590 for quick access to your email address agree with lie ryan entering it into your user dictionary will bring it up as an auto suggestion as you type however wouldnt do this for more sensitive information for more secure and even faster method id recommend using dolphin browser hd with the lastpass plugin lastpass lets you securely save user login and password info as well as different profiles with addresses and credit card numbers with this setup you can fill out whole form with one click if you dont use dolphin browser you can accomplish the same thing with the auto fill bookmarklets that lastpass offers
7601 on my phone can click the power button to turn off the screen so no buttons are there to be pressed
7604 no one pays or gets paid according to the original version of amazons developer agreement see section 2a developer received at least of the price the developer set for the app regardless of the price amazon actually sold it for but they changed the agreement adding the sentence no royalty is payable for apps with list price of
7607 on my droid theres actually proximity sensor that disables the screen if anything is too close to it on the droid this sensor is up next to the ear speaker so that when you put the phone up to your ear it triggers the proximity sensor what model phone do you have
7645 you could check your mms apn settings they can be found in settings wireless and network mobile networks access point names there should be some reference to mms settings and it should have your operators mms settings also check out the settings found in messaging menu button settings multimedia message mms settings creation mode verify these and try again
7666 im using gibberbot it is worth taking look at free software multi protocol active developer community definitely still in beta but that doesnt mean it wont do what you need
7669 the specs on the nfc controller chip in the nexus are the following http www nxp com acrobat download2 literature pdf to answer your first question as advertised in the above pdf the nfc controller chip inside the nexus has an operating distance of about centimeters however in practice specific to the nfc controller in the nexus that is its limited to about centimeters you practically have to hold the card to the back of the phone in order for it to be able to read the card centimeters is massively over exaggerated centimeters is the farthest could go with any card distance is greatly dependant on the quality of the rf transmitter and receiver on the other end so this distance may very well increase under different conditions if you have specialized equipment its possible to pick up any nfc rf communication up to distance of about meters but dont expect nfc implementations in phones to go any farther then centimeters for your second question again as advertised in the above pdf card emulation the ability to present oneself as nfc tag is supported for the following standards iso mifare felica rf to my knowledge these are all the standards one should currently care about however card emulation is not supported by the android sdk and im not sure whether or not it will be supported in future versions or even if android devs are working on such functionality it would however be the logical next step for the android sdk to support
7676 yes though it will charge slower than if plugged in to the mains supply and some usb ports are powered better than others
7677 dont know about the n1 in particular but as far as know most if not all phones charge via usb so long as the usb port provides enough power my motorola droid and g1 charge via usb my nook color and motorola xoom tablets do not charge via usb however do note that it is faster to charge with the phone plugged in to power source instead of usb port
7687 try the android screencast app see the xda thread for more details
7726 the permissions are entered by the developer yes but the android os only grants those specific permissions and no others therefore an app could try to do something it wasnt allowed to but it would fail barring security exploit see http developer android com guide topics security security html permissions for more details
7727 if developer forget to require permission they will be unable to use the feature and they will usually get force close you will be able to observe this in logcat or fails to do its work
7728 the permissions are what allows an app to do something if an app doesnt ask for permission then it cant do that thing see security and permissions on the android developer site for more info note that if you have rooted phone and allow the app superuser access then it can do pretty much whatever it wants make sure you trust any app that you give this access to
7732 the purpose of that feature is so that if there is an emergency you can dial an emergency number without having to unlock the phone its not so that someone else can use it to call your wife mother ice number its not bad idea since if you were hurt then someone else could inform those people but as understand its just for emergency numbers although to be honest dont know of any other emergency numbers other than edit just realized that if you lost your phone you wouldnt want others to be able to make calls from the phone another reason why it only allows emergency numbers however if as you suggested it only allowed certain numbers that would be cool
7733 yes its limited to emergency numbers it depends on your region and probably your carrier which ones specifically theres no easy way to change it while its probably possible to hack that mode would advise against it first because it defeats the purpose of having your phone locked do you really want someone to steal your phone and call your wife second because it might screw things up when you really need it and you cant exactly test whether is working beforehand and third because you should have id with you anyways if youre concerned about this
7742 if you have samsung galaxy press the back key and keep it pressed and then press the home key and release them both this will take screenshot it works without rooting without external applications and even if the screen is locked
7857 if youve got your time zone settings set correctly then yes it should be fine if you are in any doubt you can set it to automatically pick up the time from your network
7862 go to settings date and time and ensure your time zone is properly set this should be enough but you can also check automatic or use network time or similar to ensure it picks up the proper time
7899 jumping between roms in the same development series is usually safe without backing up or wiping the data partition although the cache and dalvik cache should always be wiped unless the installation instructions specifically tell you to wipe the data partition which seems unlikely in this case if such drastic change were needed it shouldnt be release candidate any more would nevertheless back everything up just in case both application backup like titanium backup and nandroid backup from the recovery partition but then im paranoid like that jumping to different series say cm6 to cm7 or cm to aosp you should always back up everything and wipe everything
7913 in order to avoid any possibility of data loss if something goes really wrong never happened to me but you should backup installed applications if you dont want to install all of the installed applications in case of failure sent and received sms mms photos and videos if you stored it in the main memory not common contacts only if not synchronized with gmail account emails only if not synchronized with gmail account calendar only if not synchronized with gmail account basically if you want to be sure that nothing can go wrong you need to backup all your data and configuration there are apps to do this like titanium backup
7917 nope not as of v2 anyways ive been through all the settings actions pretty thoroughly in various contexts with no luck
7919 im not sure exactly how you use the select all feature but think an effective way to mitigate your need for this is to go crazy with filters labels and the priority inbox having your gmail account sort your mail into highly specific labels for you and carefully tagging everything as either important or not important will keep the number of mails you see at any one time to reasonable amount most of the time there are ton of great tips in this article from lifehacker that ive used both on the web interface and on my gmail app oh and submit feature request to google
7965 assume you have belgian carrier some sites you can check for mms settings base and simyo http googleandroidwiki com index php carrier apn list belgium carriers proximus http forum xda developers com showthread phpt mobistar and others in the listing http androidforums com post2 html
7998 in the android market the minimum price is if try to set my app any lower it says must set it to at least
8000 expanding on bryans previous answer yes there is minimum limit on an app price free kidding aside for non free apps there is minimum limit for paid apps on the android market and that minimum is based on the currency and location where the app is offered for instance paid app offered in denmark must currently be listed for no less than krone these minimums may adjust over time to reflect fluctuations in currency value the android market is not the only source for paid apps however and each app vendor may utilize unique policies for app pricing in general however you will find that each vendor has some minimum limit set that will cover the costs of transaction fees
8002 yes you can install all the apps you buy from the amazon appstore on any device which is linked to that amazon account it operates just like paid apps in the android market which are available to all the devices associated with that particular google account have android devices and all they are all linked to the same amazon account and the same google account and when purchase an app through the market or the appstore have it on all three devices
8008 yes for non free apps there is minimum price for each supported currency as noticed this morning when adjusting the price of one of my apps these minimum prices are not exactly equivalent across currencies and even if they were they would drift over time due to exchange rate fluctuations for example set the new price of my app at for the us and the roughly equivalent price of for the uk however could not set such low prices for scandinavian countries or japan because the minimums were higher the japanese minimum is yen which is roughly us at todays rates here is the full list of minimum and maximum prices per country at current rates it seems that the cheapest possible non free app would cost approximately us
8035 in case this helps someone with the same problem have the solution had to check the settings wireless and network mobile network use packet data check box when this was done could send picture mms messages maybe obvious for some but it sure was one setting thought should not need just to send an mms message
8180 revert if the os itself is not sleeping properly you cant do much else besides install kernel or rom that behaves better
8224 in most cases your phone will only draw as much power as it needs and its ok that the charger can provide more however unless you know that your phone will do this and has other power management safety features wouldnt use the charger myself ive never had phone ruined but have had batteries ruined by non official chargers including one charger that claimed to meet the specifications for my phone
8225 as long as your charger device deliveres the right voltage then you should be safe the maximum current specification is how much ampare it can deliver before the voltage from your charger goes out of usb voltage specs or blows fuse dont know how they have constructed the htc desire battery chargine part but would use your charger they should have some current limiter for the battery in any case or you couldnt charge your phone in an ordinary computer usb connection
8239 if you use the swype keyboard holding the space key gives you tab smart keyboard pro also has tab press twice for it reference http androidforums com android applications softkeyboard tab key html
8245 on the stock keyboard on my droid the soft keyboard not the slide out see the tab character on the alt symbol keyboard hit key then alt the tab key looks like an arrow pointing right to line
8271 if you have phone with low memory like the g1 and spend your day switching between couple little applications then lowering this number will speed up your system and allow more programs to stay loaded up making switching faster if you have heavy weight applications such as the fb app that cant get their jobs done inside the limit you set they will crash and die for no apparent reason until you increase the number enough that they can survive usually find this preferable switching apps on my phone is slower but the big jobs dont randomly crash
8287 do you happen to have enabled settings application development stay awake screen will never sleep when charging
8305 dropbox wasnt made to be pdf reader instead its an application to have your files wherever you go so have two great suggestions for you ezpdf reader this is the best pdf reading application ever seen for android use it every time need to read any kind of pdf on my motorola droid adobe acrobat reader free alternative for ezpdf made by adobe of course which is very good to read your pdfs on the go too both will restore from the place that you left
8313 in order to view local files on the sdcard with the default android browser just enter file sdcard and then the path to the file you want to view for example if you have an xml file named person in folder named xmlfiles it would look like file sdcard xmlfiles person xml in your address bar you can create bookmarks for the file you are viewing but if you try to make shortcut to that bookmark or use bookmark widget at least the htc one these will not work and may give an error the linked program is no longer installed on your phone the bookmarks will work if opened from within the browser so far have verified that the browswer can open render these files xml html fileshtm and image files it cannot open pdfs according to this comment it works for android and above
8355 try downloading file explorer like es file explorer find the apk and select it android should prompt to install from there the selected answer you are referring to says to download astro which is another file manager im not sure about the default android browser though
8356 if you have samsung phone some of them have separate internal and external sd storage if its on the external sd card then you need this adress file sdcard external sd yourapp apk
8453 install terminal emulator launch it and run ps grep ps lists the processes and grep filters for the id you want but this only works if the application is running when you run the command
8458 in adb shell or terminal emulator use the following command cat proc your process id here status and look in the name field this should be the name of the process so in your case it would be cat proc status
8463 choose contacts than keypad and start entering the phone number on my galaxy running froyo this displays dropdown box with number of how many numbers start with the characters entered
8465 android assigns each application uid user id at install time unlike pid process id which is transient and keeps changing all the time uid stays constant as long as the application is not reinstalled the uid should be unique to each application except when the application explicitly requests to share userid with another application there are security restrictions around this the two applications must be signed with the same private key comes from the same developer these applications claims to show uid of applications https market android com detailsid redfishandroid appexplorer https market android com detailsid com sayhello2theworld te edit try looking at data system packages xml you need root to view this file each installed application should have an entry there say have adobe reader installed in my phone package name com adobe reader codepath mnt asec com adobe reader pkg apk flags ts version userid installer com google android feedback sigs count cert index key very long random string sigs perms package my phone have assigned userid to adobe reader for applications that have requested to share user id with another application say handcent package name com handcent nextsms codepath system app handcentsms apk flags ts version shareduserid sigs count cert index key very long random string sigs package then the attribute youre looking for is shareduserid
8467 htcs sense ui gives you this functionality out of the box in the phone app if you start typing the phone number it will filter your contacts that include either that number or the contacts name via t9 representation if you are not running sense iu suggest trying 3rd party apps that imitate the htc dialer functionality try dialer one or acontacts for example
8489 there is simple guide of the hardware fix on xda developers which doesnt require you to remove any screws it worked surprisingly well on my galaxy the trick is to increase the pressure of the gps antenna connector by placing small stripe of tape above the connector the guide on xda has some nice pictures and instructions definitely worth reading
8577 it can be shortened you can silence your phone straight from the lockscreen by sliding from right to left see this video http www youtube com watchv otq c7qjdyq at 4m
8578 personally think that the easiest way apart from sliding right to left but thats not available on all phones to put the phone into silent mode is to hold down the power button for short period of time then select silent mode
8697 im not aware of an official changelog anywhere but you can look at the commit log on the git repository here anything between the r1 tag and the r1 tag was change added in the summary its basically just bugfixes hence why its smaller increment as opposed to for example note if youre getting update from carrier then they may have added other changes to their own software so the above applies to the android os itself and not any additional components
8698 menu settings display auto rotate screen this option should disable screen rotation throughout the system menu settings cyanogenmod settings display rotate degrees this option disables the upside down rotation only
8701 only for samsung galaxy but nevertheless very very important speed speed speed my galaxy is much much quicker in handling all things the lag that was present in previous versions up and including is completely gone update maybe not only for samsung galaxy come to think of it but have only the samsung galaxy at my disposal
8710 see also how can stop applications and services from running first strongly caution against messing with this if an app is hogging system resources or otherwise being problem uninstall it android is designed to manage running services and apps automatically and manual interference is tricky and can cause various problems there are apps that claim to allow you to edit start up processes example but dont trust them many of them either do nothing or simply force close the app every time it starts many services auto restart so your phone will never sleep the services will just be run and closed over and over many of these apps dont require root so id be surprised if they could do anything at all with root you can use an app like autostarts to manage which apps are triggered by events this isnt quite the same as preventing apps from running at startup but it can help prevent them from restarting after theyve been killed recommend titanium backup for uninstalling system apps make sure you dont remove actual android os apps services just third party apps that have been protected bundled software like youd get on windows some of these apps are more important than they appear hear motorola phones have lot of useless apps that the system relies on for no good reason so use the backup feature of titanium first note that if you break something badly you may not be able to get into the phone to restore and fix it be very careful how you use all of these tools if you remove or disable system process you can make your phone unusable
8713 an android app should have good reason to start at system boot to discover the apps that are able to start at system boot install aspotcat and list all apps that are able to receive the boot completed intent if you believe that an app of this list should not start at system boot and if this app does not provide an option to disable this behavior uninstall that app also would not uninstall any system services apps as others said before android does good job in managing the limited resources of smartphone dont take your windows paradigm along to android btw the intent system that enables start at boot apps has nothing to do with the linux on which android runs
8719 can confirm what bryan denny has said in the accepted answer have samsung galaxy and an archos device both running froyo now using the same google account nothing was installed automatically when set up the archos had to install all applications wanted was able to install both the paid and the free applications had running on the galaxy only want to add that if you select an application from the android market via pc you have to choose between your devices to which device you want to install the application the devices are listed in combo box if you want to install it on both click the install button and choose the first device the button will now read installed for the second device just click installed again it will give you the option once more to choose device from your device choose the second device and it will be installed second time although is displays installed its still click through to the next screen
8761 the dalvik cache is the set of saved dex files dex file is basically compiled bytecode version of an app that has been built for the dalvik virtual machine on which androids apps run its similar to the java virtual machine and having saved class files
8793 yes you can back up your angry birds data without rooting your phone it takes few steps and its manual process but pretty easy nonetheless this works with my samsung android phone install the android sdk onto your computer from http developer android com sdk index html you will be using the adb program part of the sdks platform tools connect your android device to your computer in debugging mode on my galaxy android phone had to go to settings applications development and turn on usb debugging before connecting the cable on your computer start command prompt and run these commands cd program files android android sdk platform tools adb pull data data com rovio angrybirds files highscores lua mybackup ab highscores lua adb pull data data com rovio angrybirds files settings lua mybackup ab settings lua of course supply your own directory names depending on where you installed the android sdk and where you want the files saved to restore the files later reinstall angry birds and complete at least one level this ensures the device has the appropriate directories connect your device in debugging mode and start command prompt as done above run these commands cd program files android android sdk platform tools adb push mybackup ab highscores lua data data com rovio angrybirds files highscores lua adb push mybackup ab settings lua data data com rovio angrybirds files settings lua is it safea yes the android sdk is provided by google the developers of android for use by software developers that write applications for android devices adb its android debugging bridge is the official way that google wants developers to interact with their android devices as long as you are careful with what files you push pull its fine how about angry birds seasonsa same as above but type angrybirdsseasons instead of angrybirds and of course change the name of the local backup file
8816 found good solution do it at your own risk need to root the phone use z4root install root explorer in the archive using root explorer you must replace maybe you will need to press mount on top right corner of the program screen modem img from the archive to this location of the phone etc firmware modem img do not delete the old file replace it set permissions for the modem img file to rw restart the phone and maybe will be ok but if it is not go to next step imei information is stored in data nvram md nvram nvd imei mp0b maybe changing of your original imei is not good idea because it is against the law but if you dont have copy of that file before the factory reset you can use temporary imei file located in the arhive the archive with files needed
8859 last resort is always factory reset which should fix this problem you could also have look at the logcat output maybe this will give you hint about the cause of the problem
8902 stumbled upon this question because want to recharge my phone at night next to my bed therefore do not want it to wake me but setting the phone to silent does not solve it as want to be reachable for emergency calls my solution which isnt strictly correct answer to the question but might solve the problem for most people was using the app night ringer free which enables me to enter whitelist for calls sms however all other sounds are silenced
8925 in unix like operating systems loop device vnd vnode disk or lofi loopback file interface is pseudo device that makes file accessible as block device http en wikipedia org wiki loop device basically it allows you to make your phone think that an image file is separate storage area device
8926 the wikipedia page on loop devices explains this pretty well its basically pseudo device device which doesnt exist physically that allows file to be treated as block device for example hard drive you need support for it because the ubuntu system is stored as img file which is essentially created to be file representation of filesystem or disk partition by mounting it on loop device you can access the file as though it really was whole filesystem thus creating sort of virtual partition or disk for ubuntu to live on
8954 if you want total control over your data the best way would be for you or someone you trust to set up your own internet accessible server to use for this android natively uses the exchange active sync protocol for most of its sync to gmail sync the mail client will also use pop smtp and imap and caldav can be used for calendar sync there are few free open source exchange active sync compatible servers that you could install yourself to get all the mail calendar contacts sync working such as zimbra and open xchange but be warned this isnt just going to be simple install and configure
8970 have mobile g1 the first android phone thats few years old now and sensitivity on the touch screen is still intact if you dont treat your phone well it is likely that over time youre going to damage it or the screen can get so dirty that sensitivity might decrease but it is not an issue with the touch screen technology any phone that is badly treated will get damaged
8989 nandroid is the name for complete backup or image of your device it can be performed in clock work mod cmw clockwork mod is custom recovery because it is second of tools that can used without booting an os think of it has an additional bios when rooting and jailbreaking will want to install the clockwork mod it is the workhorse that has utilities for backups restores wipes and installing unsigned zip updates rom manager is an app accessible in the os that allows quick access and integration with clockwork mod rom manager can update and install clock work mod versions as well as automatically booting into clock work mod for quicker access to those functions cwm and rom manager were started by the same person rom manager lets download roms and then boots into cwm to backup and install them will need custom recovery know of two cwm or armon ra they permit to perform the backup rom manager isnt necessarily needed but its useful and is well integrated into cwm
9004 recovery is special space in the internal memory of your phone set aside by the manufacturer to perform diagnostics and os upgrades in windows terms its rough equivalent of boot menu usually accessed by pressing f8 during boot up its invisible to the phone under normal operation and is accessed in special way usually by turning the phone on while holding one or more buttons the problem is that the recoveries that comes with stock devices do not allow for installation of custom roms only firmware images signed by the manufacturer in order to install custom roms cyanogenmod for example you will need to replace the stock recovery image with custom one made by community developers on android there are several custom recoveries clockworkmod cwm and amon ra being the most known ones these custom recoveries allow you to do lot more things with your phone the biggest advantage is being able to flash unsigned custom roms other benefits include various tools and utilities for further managing the phones one such utility is called nandroid its backup and restore tool that allows you to take full image of all the phones internal nand memory hence the name and store it on your sd card should something go wrong with the phones software you can use the previously saved backup to restore the phone to working state the maker of clockworkmod recovery also created an android app called rom manager this app allows you to easily upgrade the cwm recovery to new version when one becomes available for your device it also allows you to manage nandroid backups stored on the sd card as well as perform slew of other useful advanced tasks these include fixing app data permissions re partitioning of the sd card right on the phone downloading different custom roms and flashing them directly from the app paid premium version of the app has more advanced features such as ota update notifications for custom roms that support it etc
9086 im not sure is dvorak is available on stock firmware for optimus but there are many 3rd party keyboard apps on the market that have it some require separate download via plugin once installed activate it by going to menu settings language keyboard and marking the checkbox next to the newly installed keyboard app then bring up any text field google search and long press it tap on the input method menu item and you will be presented with the list of all currently installed and enabled keyboard apps select the one which has dvorak layout and you will immediately be able to use it
9087 have you looked on the market there seem to be few dvorak keyboards available https market android com detailsid com reyn truedvorak feature search result https market android com detailsid net xenionsh android dvorak feature search result you should probably shop around and try as many as you can find if you dont know how to switch to an alternate keyboard youve installed look here http www simplemobilereview com change your android soft keyboard system if youre looking to change whatever keyboard you use now to the dvorak layout that may be harder it would depend on which keyboard youre using
9136 data sms messages are sent through the data network over your 2g 3g data connection just like all other data such as internet traffic normally sms messages have their own method of transport the details of which you can check out on wikipedia
9166 could not get it to change timezone or time either could not make it stop using network time either did factory reset from settings privacy correctly set my timzeone this time before saying use network time and that worked fine
9177 as of this issue is fixed for other users on previous versions temporarily solved this problem by disabling wifi all together
9190 downloaded free app called timezone changer to fix this problem still dont understand why samsung disables this
9223 used program by antbee called angry birds backup it worked great and it was free for seasons and rio used angry birds seasons backup and angry birds rio backup by whitney powell all three worked flawlessly it saved me from having to root my phone and or replay all those levels
9231 according to their dev blog the appstore does download small token for drmd apps which it uses to validate them at launch how can you verify that the user has an entitlement to the app without internet access during the installation process for an app the amazon appstore client downloads small token that grants the user the right to access the application valid token permits the user that purchased the app to access their app offline the amazon appstore client will periodically communicate with amazon servers to refresh the token my guess as to why you see the error is that the token is either out of date or just got corrupted somehow bug in the appstore maybe re downloading probably refreshes the token since its originally retrieved at install time but it sounds like you may also be able to clear the appstore data and sign in to get valid token or possibly just launch the appstore and let it connect refresh itself havent tried these myself as havent had this error yet
9242 yes there is today netflix released an offical app netflix blog post about release currently netflix playback is supported on the following phones htc incredible with android htc nexus one with android htc evo 4g with android htc g2 with android samsung nexus with android if you dont have one of these devices but you do have an htc or samsung device you can try this method here to make the netflix app work on your device have not tried this myself as have one of the supported devices try this at your own risk
9256 try twonky https market android com detailsid com pv twonkyremote
9272 if you dont mind rooting your phone perhaps the easiest thing to do is to flash cyanogenmod on it the htc magic is supported up to cm6 android froyo you can find more details here be sure to read up on the wiki it is not supported on cm7 or later android gingerbread
9277 if your phone is actually developer phone supplied through google and not consumer phone bought through phone company then youve actually got an adp2 not magic beware of that when looking for roms as they are some subtle differences in the hardware official adp2 images are hosted by htc at http developer htc com but only up to android for adp1 and adp2 if you do actually have an htc magic aka mytouch 3g then depending on your phone company there are official froyo releases for the magic which have been pushed out ota by some phone companies see this previous question for more info when will my phone get the android update froyo if going for unofficial roms then be careful again as there are at least two hardware variants of this with incompatible roms the magic and magic
9290 would think its so that rogue apps cant transmit pictures of what youre doing of course that doesnt explain why apps that read sms or whatever dont require root
9293 no idea why it wasnt available before but as of non rooted screen shot support was added for system apps at least as eldarerathis noted there are some articles out there implying that this would let any app capture screen shot now but according to an android engineer this permission is only granted to apps signed by the system images keys it is only available to be rolled into the os not as feature 3rd party apps can access
9321 note many of these applications use map data from really cool free map project called osm openstreetmap which anyone can contribute to osm is constantly improving but in many areas it may lack information like house building numbers free google maps google maps does have some offline functionality including offline navigation as of version but the size of the area you can download is limited you cant download an entire us state for instance and some countries or areas arent available for download see here for instructions download map and use it offline here maps unless youre looking to support osm this is probably the best free option out there it works offline has maps in nearly countries and turn by turn navigation in over countries features include full street addresses points of interest alternate routes traffic public transport and speed limits notable features that are missing ability to add multiple stops to route lane assist rerouting based on traffic and ability to navigate to contacts addresses osmand open source uses data from osm currently only has 2d navigation but one of the better free options available mapfactor osm based offline navigation fairly basic but promising tomtom maps available as an in app purchase navmii formerly navfree north latin america elsewhere ad supported allows you to download maps for offline navigation also osm based osm has maps for the whole world but for some reason navmii only has maps available for certain countries mostly in europe and north america many others based on osm here android openstreetmap wiki paid copilot live premium usa elsewhere copilot live is very nice full featured app which will let you download maps ahead of time and use gps offline ended up using it because the us version was so cheap compared to the other paid navigation apps but ive been very pleased with the quality features customer support and free app and map upgrades it has all the features could want in gps app the only downsides being you have to have paid subscription for traffic data the paid app includes free one year subscription and you will have to buy new maps if you travel outside your purchased area other paid apps that havent used garmin viago magellan smartgps ndrive scout formerly skobbler usa elsewhere sygic tomtom there are detailed reviews of many android gps apps here android sat nav apps
9328 sidestepping the debate over the legitimacy of installing that app on your phone the question of verification is one that ive been meaning to understand for while and youve prompted me to try to figure out possible way of verifying who signed an apk android apps are signed in the normal manner of jar files apk is really just special jar which is just special zip however it may not be trivial to trace the authenticity of the certificates unless you have something known good to compare to thats basically what the phone itself does verifies that something that claims to be from the same party as something already on the phone actually is the phone doesnt refuse to install things with unknown signers it can only object to clear application data of apparent forgeries when something new doesnt match something old that it claims to you will need to have jarsigner and keytool believe these come from the jdk which is prerequisite to the android sdk rather than the sdk itself first you want try to verify the public key contained within the apk usually this is in meta inf certs rsa but it can be in another file unzip will tell you you want to see what you can find out about it unzip suspect apk meta inf cert rsa keytool printcert thats going to dump out lot of information about who the signer claims to be some certificates are apparently themselves signed by known parties but without figuring out how to trace that suspect you could do something like this unzip suspect apk meta inf cert rsa keytool printcert grep md5 unzip knowngood apk meta inf cert rsa keytool printcert grep md5 if you have known trusted apk from the same author who used the same certificate im assuming that the certificates having the same md5 sum is enough assuming youve decided to trust the certificate then you can see if it has been used to sign each of the files within the apk jarsigner verbose verify suspect apk if theres more than one rsa file in the archive you should add the certs flag to tell you which certificates have been used to sign each file so you can be sure its the certificate you verified
9373 if you install eclipse with the android sdk there is perspective called ddms that includes file explorer you can easily copy files from to the device with this tool which uses adb push pull in background another way is to simply unmount the sd card from the phone and use it as mass storage but in this mode you can access only the sd card and the debug mode must be disabled which can be annoying if you need the device to stay in debug mode for development
9395 you would need custom rom that supports moving apps to the ext3 partition would recommend searching the development section of xda developers forums for your handset for such rom if rom does not support apps2ext natively you can try your luck with script example for htc dream magic here that can be installed on top of another rom edit just adding stuff from my comments to the answer if you are on android version and above you can use the built in apps to sd functionality to move apps to sd card go to menu settings applications manage applications then tap on any app and under the storage section tap the move to sd button after few seconds you will see the buttons name change to move to phone and size of the app decrease significantly this method is not without drawbacks first off an app needs to be explicitly coded to support this functionality second widgets and apps that run as service mail virtual keyboards weather notifications etc dont work when moved to sd and must reside on the phones internal memory furthermore not the entire app moves to the sd card part of it stays on the phone along with its cache and data settings if you have phone with small amount of internal app storage using the built in apps to sd will just prolong the inevitable out of memory errors the apps2ext scripts resolve most of these shortcomings it fools the phone into thinking that the ext2 partition is part of the phones internal memory this means that widgets and services will work just fine with this method also since you can make your partition as large as you wish recommended not to exceed 2gb the space issues disappear the scripts also provide options for moving caches and data to the ext partition in order to free up even more internal memory the drawback of the apps2ext method is that its well hack first off your phone needs to be rooted second you will no longer be able to un mount and remove the sd card from the phone since all of the apps including system ones reside on the ext partition third you are putting lot more strain on the sd card from increased writing which may shorten its lifespan finally as with any hack it may make your phone less stable
9408 theres qtadb which uses adb you can also install an ssh or ftp server on the phone and then use nautilus with ssh ip or name of your phone or ftp ip or name of your phone urls you can create bookmarks in nautilus the cool thing about standard ssh or ftp server on your phone is that you dont have to install anything special on the computer use quicksshd on the phone but there are also other ssh servers available search the market please ftp servers know are swiftp and ftpserver didnt test these with nautilus yet but they should work
9413 you can also opt for an easier way as described in this answer if all youre looking for is to shift apps from your phones internal memory to sd card free app called link2sd will help in this case it has decent gui and makes it easier to move apps between sd card and internal memory also fixes the market links so that updates from the market are automatically moved to sd card if the app was previously on sd card
9415 titanium media sync offers continuous sync from sd card to dropbox but not the other way the way do it is setup rsync jobs with tasker and rsyncbackup requires your dropbox to be automatically kept in sync on desktop pc somewhere running an ssh server the following should get you up and running step dropbox remote first setup dropbox on computer somewhere running an ssh server so you can copy files from it over ssh with rsync and make sure it setup with private key encryption with an agent so you don need to enter passphrases passwords every time step rsync from remote to phone then get rsync4android market link that lets you setup rsync jobs from remote server to your phone and vice versa use it for this but also for backing up my photos to my pc automatically every night then create an rsync job to download particular folder from your remote dropbox on your pc into the dropbox folder on your sd card step scheduled automatic rsync jobs get tasker which lets you schedule jobs to happen on large number of triggers including time market link create tasker job to fire off your new rsync job to keep your dropbox folder up to date step enjoy like say it bit around the houses but seems to do the job ive also posted copy of these instructions on my blog
9423 you just have to re download them not re purchase them the apps are tied to your account not your device as far as know you dont have to do thing to your old device before your apps are available for download and installation on your new one post in this thread states the same for what its worth
9424 you will not have to repurchase them if you associate the same google account with the new device they will be available in your market to re download dont know if you can have more then one phone associated with the same account but did not do anything when got new phone except associate my google account to the new phone
9451 download the app called rescan media from the market run it then go back to your music player the music that you downloaded from dropbox should now show up there are other ways to force this media sync unmount remount sd should do it but this app makes it just the press of button
9468 usb data cables are pretty much interchangeable even on devices that have modified sockets to allow connecting headset cable to the usb port you can usually still use normal usb cable for charging and data with no harm to the device
9472 as far as know gmail will cache your most recent emails if you have to search or browse through any labels you probably wont be able to get to those emails but your inbox or at least the most recent in the inbox should be available to view since your last sync additionally you should also be able to draft emails while offline and save the drafts you just wont be able to send them until online again
9473 is it possible to download the new emails from the gmail account while online and then read them while offline yes but only for your inbox think if you open your inbox on your phone while you have connection and let all of the messages you have unread propagate to your phone then close the gmail app and put yourself in airplane mode you can reopen the gmail app and read through your unread messages is it possible to write emails while offline that will be sent when online yes if you compose and send an mail normally the messages that say sending will go out as soon as you have connection again just tested this by using airplane mode
9481 yes and not just for the inbox but inbox and sent may be the only folders synchronized by default from within the android gmail client press menu select more select settings scroll down and select labels change the number of days from which you want messages kept on the phone change individual labels effectively folders to none this number of days or all note this answer was written about now obsolete version of the gmail app which continues to change in its user interface over time the answer will not be updated to track that evolution as there are multiple versions in use at any time which behave differently and it is ultimately the idea rather than the specific steps which are important
9500 as your comment suggested on the other answer now deleted you cant the android marketplace app on honeycomb seems to be very close to the web version which at the time of posting didnt allow ratings comments sorry to be the bearer of bad news
9501 as far as know nexus uses the so called micro usb cable the same my galaxy does this is very good because you can buy generic cable like that in retail stores or shops that sells electronic stuff did so few days after bought my cell phone and it costed the equivalent of us in my country chile
9528 good way to back up app data if youre not rooted is to used adb from the android sdk for example to back up the data for locale youd do something like the following adb pull data data com twofortyfouram locale backup locale and to restore just use adb push with the same arguments in reverse order adb push backup locale data data com twofortyfouram locale you should be able to back up apps from data app the same way
9551 tablets have larger batteries than phones and may be unable to sufficiently charge from the half amp limit of usb port especially while they are fully on screen on and full speed processor clock some will barely charge if the screen is off but come with high current 5v usb like wall chargers others use higher voltage charger on custom connector typically something round sometimes the usb like ones are actually special cables with extra pins that tell the tablet that special high current charger is being used check your user manual or try the supplied charger
9552 the answer is no not all application will have root permission not all the apps require root and the apps requiring root will not have it unless you give them permission to do so at least thats what can tell after using z4root and superoneclick to root few phones you get superuser app that will get requests from apps needing the root account and youll have the option to enable that or not risks connected to rooting device are more or less the risks connected to using an administrative user on any kind of unix like system ever tried rm command to delete all files on gnu linux its like putting in the recycle bin your windows folder and empty it just because youre root user and you can do it superpowers always involve super responsibilities and super attentions said that have to say that in my everyday use with little brain turned on cant see real way to get any kind of harm but if you install strange scripts coming from al quaeda and tons of pirated apps and poor not certified code well bad things could happen install recovery and do nandroid backup after that play happily with your phone
9554 if you root your phone then only the applications that you explicitly grant root access to will have root access this does make things fairly safe as that extra step should be enough to make you stop and think why does this app need root if you only grant root access to apps that need root for good reason are from trusted developers and which you acquired from trusted source then you should be ok bear in mind what apps with root access can do though from previous answer on the subject on rooted phone an app which has been granted root access can do pretty much anything that is possible in the hardware apps that have root permissions can write on non read only storage media including modifying the bootloader modify other programs private data modify system settings modify system files etc rooted app can also hide itself from the system and pretend to be uninstalled while being perfectly well and alive ill let you imagine what the worst case scenario security implications are for nefarious app being granted root access on your phone be careful out there
9561 it should be noted that the dropbox app doesnt actually sync the files to your phone it just presents you with list whenever you select file in the dropbox app then it downloads it to your phone on my incredible the dropbox folder is just in the root of the sd card
9576 discovered that k9 mail was keeping 25mb of cached data on my internal storage changed it to use the sd card and this cured my immediate problem of being unable to install tiny app it doesnt explain though why android was reporting an insufficient storage error whilst simultaneously telling me there was 14mb free on internal storage oh well
9623 normally you would do this from settings applications manage applications find the app in the list click it and choose clear defaults
9625 if you choose 3g only you have no connectivity if you are in an area where no 3g is available with 2g 3g the phone will fallback to 2g if it cant get 3g connection
9631 2g 3g is not recommended if youre in an area with spotty 3g coverage as radio switching back and forth will drain the battery much quicker this is the major reason this widget option exists to allow users to switch between 2g and 2g 3g on the fly
9684 if you need easy access to it then menu settings cyanogenmod settings display interface notification power widget widget buttons toggle orientation will add widget on the notification menu that lets you enable or disable rotation just about the only time it seems useful is if you are lying on your side and you want the phone to stay in landscape but it sure is convenient for that
9722 ive got funambol running though it looks like could sync via ubuntu one as im on ubuntu its easier to sync contacts between evolution and funambol than thunderbird and funambol but it works was able to install funambol server on my local machine no problem my laptop isnt really functional server so opted to just sign up with http www funambol com to make sure can actually sync laptop calendar addressbook funambol android contacts calendar that is working ill let you know if learn anything in switching from www funambol com to my own instance of funambol
9745 its been tested by group here http arstechnica com gadgets news researchers enable mesh wifi networking for android smartphones ars so it is possible
9770 for some phones and devices especially the older ones the internal storage is quite limited every application and its data files take precious space my ideos has 512mb and was nearly full before started evacuating apps to the sd card another factor is the ability to backup your apps and data or move them to another device other than that you are right in your observation that apps load slower from the external storage compared to the internal storage this is very visible if you have those apps shortcuts on your home screen youll see generic android icon for the first seconds until the app is located on the card found that switching to class microsd had the default class that came with the phone improved the situation considerably still it takes my phone about seconds to equalize following cold start
9787 advantages extend the available space on internal memory for installing more apps although some parts of the app still stay on the internal memory data and settings it still frees up significant amount of space for older handsets with 150mb of free space g1 mt3g etc this is huge improvement for owners of these devices this advantage alone outweighs any disadvantages that this method brings disadvantages cannot use apps moved to sd card if its unmounted kind of self explanatory if you un mount the sd card for removal the apps that reside on it need to be stopped and um mounted as well to prevent crashes and data loss if you do remove the card inability to use widgets or sync adapters when you move those apps to sd card this is design limitation that stands from the above point since the apps stored on sd cards need to be able to be removed on demand things like widgets or apps that hook into your account settings skype linkedin will crash with no easy way to re start them so google made compromise by requiring these apps to stay on internal memory even if you do manage to force them to the sd card some custom roms allow this you simply wont be able to use them longer boot up and shut down times when the system mounts un mounts all of the apps stored on sd card apps that were moved to sd card are not stored in plain sight to prevent rampant piracy instead android sets aside some space and creates virtual partition for each app that you move this means that at the initial boot up all these virtual partitions need to be mounted before apps stored on them can be accessed the same holds true when you turn the handset off each virtual partition is un mounted before other shutdown processes can happen depending on the number of installed apps this can take an extra minute or even longer for the system to stabilize upon boot up and about extra seconds for shutting down once this happens though launching these apps doesnt take any longer than those on internal memory extra wear on the sd card this point is debatable since writing to sd card which causes wear doesnt happen that often and besides the sd cards these days are cheap enough to not worry about their life time apps require an update to support this functionality ability to be moved to sd card is not automatically granted to older apps developers must change their apps to support this feature and issue an update via market or whatever distribution method they use some older apps may not be supported any longer and so may never get this feature although some custom roms can override this for most people that are running stock firmware this is problem for newer devices with gigabytes of internal memory moving apps to external storage is not necessary since space is not an issue however for handsets with low memory its an invaluable tool that extends their shelf life for their owners
9792 the project mentioned by bobflemming is the serval project and they are also on twitter the android application will be available soon apparently thought id mention because not entirely straightforward to find it through the youtube link and that the twitter account isnt advertised on the site also cannot or comment yet so adding it as reply
9831 you can go to settings sound volume and turn down the media volume all the way to used automateit to mute media sound unless the earphone is plugged hack that used to do is to just cover up the speaker hole until can turn down the volume
9843 the galaxy tab gt p1000 can use more power in operation than it can draw from an usb port if this is the case the battery will eventually run out this is especially likely if your gt p1000 is doing lot of battery consuming things such as wifi gps high cpu loads or having the screen on all the time your mileage will also vary depending on the usb port as different usb cards can supply different power levels the default spec is less than what the gt p1000 usually draws though nobody to blame here for me typically using wifi no gps screen always on hardly any cpu load and connected to dell latitude laptop my tab will de charge about per hour if turn the screen off it will actually recharge although slower than with the samsung wall plug
9878 in general you can assume that sd refers to sdhc its the standard if your phone supported sdxc it would definitely be advertised
9889 the hc in every sd card name simply means high capacity every sd card with more than 8gb is sdhc card every sdhc card is sd standart sd which means your device is compatible with microsdhc card up to gb
9906 yes there are couple of options for this including sshdroid does not require rooted phone quicksshd see this google thread for some discussion dropbear requires rooted phone see this droidforums thread for some discussion sshelper does not require rooting free software under gpl it incorporates also code from other projects might eventually appear in the droid repository some other free libre software projects of an ssh server have been mentioned in the discussion of their potential inclusion into droid some of these apps will require you to root your device sshdroid quicksshd and sshelper at least do not there may be others as well there are certainly multiple choices for you to investigate depending on your requirements desired features etc
9907 you could make your action depend on variable condition true and then make two different profiles profile set condition to true profile set condition to true your profile if variable condition true then and there goes your exit task but would be nice if the authors would enhance tasker for that
9934 you can do this using pdanet from knowyourmobile com to use your milestone as mobile broadband dongle you will need motorola milestone usb drivers pdanet tethering software to buy right now limited trial also available step tap the upward pointing arrow on the milestones home screen to get to the app menu tap the settings icon tap applications tap development check the box for usb debugging step ii install the pdanet software on both your pc and milestone when installed on the desktop it should automatically install the usb driver for you but if it doesn you will have to use the driver you downloaded above connect your milestone to your pc via usb then launch pdanet on your device click on turn pdanet on on the milestone right click the pdanet icon in the taskbar on your pc then click connect
9966 youre not going to be able to achieve this using just userland tools like what you describe at least not while android is running the reason is because the ril opens the radio device generally some device node under dev as low level linux service and while that has an exclusive lock on the device nothing else can read from or write to the radio the ril then communicates to the android platform for all radio related events it could be done with some extensive modifications to the underlying linux kernel its open source so definitely possibility if you dont mind getting your hands dirty in or by replacing the ril daemon not as easy because the rild is not required to be open source therefore you dont know what the underlying implementation is without reverse engineering doing the latter will break androids ability to use it properly unless you somehow come up with compatibility channel to proxy communication between the new ril and the existing ril and even then theres good chance that android will become confused when it tries to make call knowing that the modem should not currently be in use but getting response from the radio saying that it is in use failing that you might also be able to achieve it by replacing the phone app and using all native platform apis but im kind of thinking that it wont work at least based on my knowledge of how htc radios work in an htc device when you place call android notifies rild which places the call and then rild tells the radio that it should route all call audio through the handset speaker and route all sound picked up from the microphone into the phone call the android platform does not handle call audio routing itself all of the above requires rooting the device and installing custom built rom at minimum
9978 root call blocker seems to fit the bill perfectly as the name implies though it requires the handset to be rooted use it personally and so far its been doing its job well there are plenty of alternatives on the market for you to try
9979 dont use an app what do is have spammer record in my contacts whenever receive telemarketing call add that phone number to the spammer contact give out my google voice number exclusively within gv have that contact blocked so any calls from one of those numbers receives the ding ding ding this number is not in service message in those rare cases where the call is to my actual cell phone number it quite obviously displays spammer on the screen and simply slide to ignore the call
9980 if you are in the us would highly recommend getting google voice number anytime form asks for your phone number give it your google voice number instead of your real phone number this way you can screen calls or block calls inside of google voice along with other benefits such as transcribing your voicemails and unlimited texting
9990 would recommend two apps call blocker which works really fine and blocks calls as well as inconvenient text messages and tasker very powerful tool that does lot of things besides blocking undesired calls
10024 you can use logcat viewer such as logcat reader ive found that one works well and just scroll back through the logs until the time in question less precise solution would be to go to settings about phone battery use and that will tell you what has been using most of your battery
10027 when you get gingerbread on your galaxy then the battery usage graph shows whats using power over time settings about phone battery use and then press on the graph at the top for more detailed view broken down by app over time you can also get there through settings applications battery use and then pressing on the graph at the top dont know if this is samsung or gingerbread feature but is part of samsungs official gingerbread release for the galaxy which was released few weeks ago in many countries networks
10034 unfortunately dont think you can it looks like samsung hasnt released hebrew version see this related question does froyo include full hebrew support for all devices as well as is hebrew support built into android
10046 if you root your vibrant you should be able to get hebrew characters support as described here basically you are just overwriting system default fall back font with the one that has hebrew this will get your phone to recognize the incoming text next you can install virtual keyboard with language pack such as anysoftkeyboard and the hebrew language pack
10064 desktop apps pandaapp pc suite this is full fledge pc suite for android much like nokia pc suite and has interface better the myphoneexplorer it has all features you need file manager sms manager screen capture application installer etc hi suit this is for huawei ideos phones dont know if it can work with other phones as well it can be downloaded from huawei ideos page link direct link hiapk pc suit webapps airdroid this link lists good pc suites for android
10084 the problem is that the automatic time zone setting on the samsung galaxy tab defaults to on and the preference to disable it is missing from the built in settings application there is an app on the android market specifically designed to correct this issue called galaxy time zone fix it mimics the date time section of the built in settings application but adds the missing preferences
10096 you should be able to register multiple kindle apps or devices to the one amazon account for example can read the same book on my kindle htc desire using the kinde app and the desktop application on work and home computers
10099 no because unlike the iphone ipod touch the unlock pin can be longer then digits android allows between and digits for the lock screen since it is unknown what the length of your pin is you have to press ok to indicate you are done
10101 as per their faq how many kindles can use to access titles in my library most books you purchase from the kindle store may be simultaneously accessed for your personal use on up to six kindles or kindle compatible devices such as kindle for pc or kindle for iphone registered to your amazon com account if the limit is less than six simultaneous copies for specific title youll see the message simultaneous device usage up to simultaneous devices per publisher limits on the amazon com detail page if you reach the device limit and want to replace one of your current devices with new one you must first deregister and delete the content from the device you wish to replace before you can access the content in question from your new device for device registration instructions please see the help page for the device you wish to register deregister on the kindle support pages subscription content such as magazines and blogs can only be downloaded to one kindle at time and cannot be accessed from kindle for pc so yes you can read the ebook on multiple devices but be aware that there is limit of or fewer devices
10104 some of the alternate lock types unlock immediately the built in android pattern lock where you do join the dots between the nine dots displayed on the screen unlocks immediately your finger lifts off the screen presuming that youve got the pattern right
10126 the apps are usually in some way tied to your contacts like gmail for example if they did not read your contacts you could not get your contacts to show up when you typed in an email address or name if they did not write you could not add new gmail contact do you have specific app you are curious about you cannot limit permissions of an application by default but there are some 3rd party roms that are testing this functionality
10132 as goggles is an app that youve said youre curious about here are the permissions it asks forcopied from the market web page this application has access to the following your accounts google app engine allows applications to sign in to google app engine using the accounts stored on this phone access other google services allows applications to sign in to unspecified google services using the accounts stored on this phone act as an account authenticator allows an application to use the account authenticator capabilities of the accountmanager including creating accounts and getting and setting their passwords manage the accounts list allows an application to perform operations like adding and removing accounts and deleting their password use the authentication credentials of an account allows an application to request authentication tokens hardware controls take pictures and videos allows application to take pictures and videos with the camera this allows the application at any time to collect images the camera is seeing your location coarse network based location access coarse location sources such as the cellular network database to determine an approximate device location where available malicious applications can use this to determine approximately where you are fine gps location access fine location sources such as the global positioning system on the device where available malicious applications can use this to determine where you are and may consume additional battery power network communication full internet access allows an application to create network sockets your personal information read contact data allows an application to read all of the contact address data stored on your device malicious applications can use this to send your data to other people write contact data allows an application to modify the contact address data stored on your device malicious applications can use this to erase or modify your contact data storage modify delete usb storage contents modify delete sd card contents allows an application to write to the usb storage allows an application to write to the sd card having used goggles for while these all seem fairly innocuous here are what goggles does that needs those permissions your accounts everything under this heading is needed because goggles links to your google account and stores your goggles history in your google account so that you can go back at look at your previous searches even after you change phones to do this it needs to access the google account login credentials already saved in your phones accounts list otherwise it would have to prompt you to log in to google every time you open it or re save your credentials again itself which is bit silly when theyre already stored centrally on the phone if you have more than one google account on your phone then the first time you open goggles it asks you which one you want to save your history into theres setting that stops it saving your search history if you dont want this hardware controls the entire point of goggles is to take pictures using the camera it cant do that without these permissions your location using goggles you can take pictures of landmarks and buildings and have it automatically identify them it uses your location to help it narrow down the guesses of what youre photographing network communication it uses googles servers and massive databases to help it identify the potentially billions of different things you could photograph and ask it to recognize your personal information read write contact data you can take photo of business card with goggles and have it save the contact details from the business card straight into your contacts storage you can set goggles to save all the images it takes to your sd card for later viewing via the gallery app this is in the settings and is off by default so as far as can see they have legitimate reason for all of the permissions that the app asks for that fits with one or more of the apps functions or needs could they also use these permissions for other purposes yes but personally trust the app to only use the access for the required purposes after all google has plenty of other ways to get all of that info as im already syncing all of my contacts etc up to gmail anyway
10146 there may be an option in your settings but easier just open google maps start using the compass and spin your phone in figure pattern that is all there is to it
10148 it depends on your model of phone if there is no built in compass calibration application from the manufacturer then likely you can calibrate your compass by opening up any application that uses the compass and moving the device in certain manner here are two types of movements to try the figure pattern easier said than understood heres what it looks like youtube video of figure compass calibration three axis rotations rotate around each of the three axes so one full rotation with screen facing up one full rotation rolling sideways one full rotation pitching forward
10183 am using go launcher ex home launcher which saves the current configuration and we can restore it whenever we need if you have different launcher check for backup restore configuration settings
10184 if youre using launcherpro go to your home screen press menu preferences backup homescreen settings to backup and restore backup is in the same place this cant restore your widgets but remembers their places though also some app specific shortcuts need to be recreated in my case shortcuts to mail mailboxes
10213 have finally had chance to look at the logcat while the problem was occuring the error message reads completed command player prepare status according to this forum it caused by having too many mediaplayer objects active at once unfortunately have not yet found fix the only known workaround seems to be rebooting am still not sure which app or combination of apps reproduce the error reliably edit guess that any application that uses the mediaplayer class can cause the problem those apps probably never reach state where they call mediaplayer release maybe we need to contact the vendors of applications that use the mediaplayer so they make sure they call release my superficial research did not lead to solution that would fix the problem without reboot edit have updated to android gingerbread and unfortunately this problem still persists some logcat messages around the error playerdriver commandcompleted playerdriver completed command player init status pvplayer run set video surface cancelled pvplayer run set audio output cancelled playerdriver send player code playerdriver create realtime output playerdriver commandcompleted playerdriver completed command player set audio sink status pvplayer run prepare cancelled playerdriver send player code playerdriver disable natpkt after getdurationfromrandomscan clipduration after getdurationfromrandomscan clipduration playerdriver handleinformationalevent playerdriver handleinformationalevent type unhandled playerdriver commandcompleted playerdriver completed command player prepare status playerdriver command player prepare completed with an error or info pvplayer check for live streaming cancelled playerdriver handleinformationalevent playerdriver pvmfinfoerrorhandlingcomplete mediaplayer22989 info warning mediaplayer22989 error audioservice audiofocus abandonaudiofocus from android media audiomanager 480f3630null audioservice audiofocus abandonaudiofocus from android media audiomanager 480f3630null playto opening content dtmedia media with android player playto about to set android player datasource to content dtmedia media pvplayer isdrmfile playing pvplayer reset playerdriver send player code playerdriver handlecancelallcommands playerdriver commandcompleted playerdriver completed command player cancel all commands status playerdriver send player code playerdriver handlereset playerdriver commandcompleted playerdriver completed command player reset status playerdriver send player code playerdriver handleremovedatasource playerdriver commandcompleted playerdriver completed command player remove data source status pvplayer unmap file
10224 just learned this lesson the hard way amazon requires at least once daily connection to the internet or you wont be able to access your apps purchased from them was overseas with spotty internet service and after one day all apps gave me the same error message amazon made no apologies when complained but they refunded my purchases so could buy them again through the android market which doesnt have such idiotic requirements
10228 you can set it to stay on as long as its plugged in to do that go to menu settings applications development and choose stay awake
10231 think you are searching for this app keep screen lite it allows you to keep your mobile always awake for some of the applications you can set the applications to not to screen timeout
10246 you cannot just install cyanogenmod on any rooted device it has to be one of the supported devices there lot of differences between builds of android and cyanogenmod for each device they have different chipsets gps cameras etc they are always looking for other people to help support new devices though
10293 new app location alert will do this never forget another task with location alert now available completely free location alert is cutting edge application that reminds you to perform tasks based upon your current location rather than time often there are tasks to which you cannot specify certain time however would like to be reminded when in certain vicinity for instance you don know when exactly you will leave work this evening but whenever you do and are crossing the grocery store on your way home you want to be reminded to pick up milk location alert to the rescue dont know what time youll be crossing the science department but need to remember to drop off that assignment whenever you do dont know what time youll reach office but must remember to hand in that check to accounting need reminder to pick up the dvd you left at sams house whenever youre in the vicinity next time
10367 yes gps does need clear view of the sky however that does not mean actual gps implementations have to rely only on gps signal to get its location most actual gps implementations including android caches last known location and uses wifi cell positioning to get position information even when there is no gps signals at all
10376 gps uses radio frequencies between and ghz l1 signal at ghz and l2 signal at ghz these have to get through for gps to work which is not the same as visibility for example my gps garmin etrex legend hcx gets fix on the top floor of the house below the roof made of tiles insulation and drywall it doesnt get fix on lower floors where theres too much concrete and steel in between btw had motorola defy for while if remember correctly it also worked but had much lower precision sometimes it was hundreds of meters off
10383 you can get remote shell with it without the screen working you will have to install the android sdk on your pc another thing you can do is use android screencast to view the screen remotely it doesnt have the best frame rate but at least you will be able to interact with the screen you may have to use this to get the remote shell working as you may have to turn on usb debugging in settings applications development usb debugging you can also get replacement screen found couple on ebay ranging from some are just the lcd screen some include the the touch input panel too
10402 you could use it to test accessibility applications that are used by blind or visually impaired these apps rely on audio and haptic feedback to tell you what is going on not sure how youd get into that mode however
10449 cant shed any light on your current experience im afraid its possible that timescape has some sort of feature built in but have just the app for you call track syncs all your calls to your calendar including time duration and number and name if theyre in contacts and will import your existing call log you can select specific calendar or label to sync with hope that helps
10477 go to contacts press menu button and choose more then display options there you can choose either sim or phone and say done
10648 specify ssid in the wifi connected context to be abc xyz this will activate the context if you connect to abc or xyz reference http tasker dinglisch net userguide en matching html
10708 theres an app called screen resolution that will tell you the ummm screen resolution what device do you have have seen some specs for devices coming with mp camera mostly by sony ericsson but dont think they are out yet so it is possible that the manufacture is not lying
10713 mightytext is google chrome extension android app that will let you compose send and receive text messages in google chrome by connecting to your phone so it just forwards received messages from your phone to chrome and sent messages from chrome to your phone
10791 you should first dismount the card you can do this via settings sd card and phone storage unmount sd card you can certainly corrupt data and cause application crashes if you dont do this first
10796 yes you will be able to remove the sd card as mathew said in his answer first you need to unmount sd card from settings and then remove the sd card in this case no need to remove the battery or sim card but there are some things that you need to take care of if you have moved any of the applications to sd card then you cannot access them without sd card make sure that you are not accessing any of the applications that are installed on sd card after removing the sd card you can see status message saying sd card removed in the notification bar of the phone you might need to restart your phone after inserting the same sd card back to the phone some of the applications might not work am sure this happens on eclair devices
10834 finally found the solution and the reason installed sms backup application from market sometime back this application syncs the messages call logs and contacts with gmail installed once and removed in that time span it sync the contacts call logs with my gmail thats why can see the call logs label in my gmail
10904 know its an old thread but wanted to the comment about btep im also using bteps ssh binary though just call it from its path instead of linking it data data com magicandroidapps bettertermpro bin ssh root or generate pair of keys and use public key authentication data data com magicandroidapps bettertermpro bin ssh data data com magicandroidapps bettertermpro home ssh id rsa root use the above command from sl4a r4 in various scripts and it works fine before could do this needed to chmod data data com magicandroidapps bettertermpro home ssh once this is done and you backup restore btep with titaniumbackup the permissions are kept this means if you flash new rom you can just restore the apps and all your scripts will work again
10936 short answer because computers are complicated and the screenshot functionality is actually not very simple for the programmer not for the user in other words taking screenshot requires the screenshotting process to hook pretty deep into the os internals mess with them for bit and unhook again since android tries to have built in security model as opposed to the bolted on afterthought seen in windows taking screenshot trips on several security barriers those can be bypassed but the only currently practical way short of creating holes and potential vulnerabilities in the kernel is to use the all powerful root account which is not subject to the limitations
10947 the answer is rather simple its permissions issue android uses what is called framebuffer for the video display the framebuffer is located at dev graphics fb0 this file which is basically stream that the device writes to when changes in the user interface occur contains frames of the screen display the permissions on the framebuffer file is rw rw note that the last group has that basically means that if you are not the owner which is root you do not have permission to even read from that file if there was system installed application that could take screenshots it would have permission to read from the framebuffer which believe is how the motorola xoom is able to take screenshots it has an application installed on the device as system app reading the framebuffer for developer is actually simple if they have access to read it
10951 due to androids security focus on separating all apps from each others data to prevent malicious apps from stealing or altering data in apps that you trust they cant allow an app to take screenshots of other apps think about how many of your apps are able to do things like ocr to translate pictures into text can think of at least four apps on my phone that can do this prime example is google goggles ocring book titles and also ocring and then translating blocks of text in foreign languages now think about how many of your apps put text on screen that you wouldnt want an untrustworthy app to see have password database app on my phone with an encrypted database of my passwords for various systems malicious screensaver app could wait until that password apps running take picture of the screen with the login details on it then ocr them and send them off it could also do the same for everything in your contacts list even if you dont give the app permission to your contacts database or your browser history or chat logs and so on this is only one way that it could abuse access to your screen this is why for screenshotting to be universal it needs to be in the os which you already trust with all your data this is why on phones that do have the screen shot function built in its been added as part of the system not as separate app if you root your phone and allow an app to take screenshots then you are effectively saying that you implicitly trust that app to be able to do everything that the system can do including accessing and interfering with other apps and their data and that you totally trust it not to abuse that access thats not something that androids ever going to allow anything except the system os to do
10982 ext4 should be supported if you have an upgrade to or android see that your post is from just before the releases and when btrfs is added to android it has nice mount option ssd with wear levelling etc that ext4 doesnt have and more speed than ext4 now esp if you use compress lzo or space cache in fstab but dont use compression with the space cache option only use or the other or else it slows to crawl in some benchmarks and that speed comes despite btrfs checksumming of all data not only of the journals as ext4 does
10988 if you have wireless network set up can recommend to connect via ssh it allows you to access and fully manage your android in few minutes for linux or putty users there is no difference to standard terminal using ssh besides some specific android commands moreover some file managers such as nautilus support the ssh protocol so you will have the flexibility of shell and additionally the comfort for file operations using graphical file manager liked ssh so much that have written small how to for android in german know it might not fully apply to your question but can be considered while working with an additional computer and an android phone an easy to use ssh server is ssh droid available in the google market
11148 whisper systems has come out with custom rom that has this exact feature http www whispersys com permissions html as darthnoodles mentions it has to be done at the system level rather than the app level which is how it is implemented in whispercore the current version isnt able to block all of the permissions available on android but they are working on supporting more of them

11169 the samsung galaxy tab has loading current of but the usb specificication only allows ma for the whole bus with this in mind it should be clearly visible why the sgt isnt charging via usb at least that is true for the original samsung firmware if you are able to install custom roms you will probably get fast charge support with this activated your tab will even charge over usb but it will take much more time than with the ac power adaptor
11305 dont store data on the micro sd card its easy to take out and insert into another device
11320 have the same problem here using galaxy with android looking at the log we can see the pid proccess id used by playerdriver playerdriver completed command player prepare status so ive killed the playerdriver process and it has fixed in order to do that you need to root your device and connect with adb as root ex adb shell su next time ill try identify what files and pipes the process is using through lsof command hope this help
11362 the official google app requires android or newer and as the market share for and older is now vanishingly small and getting smaller by the day at time of writing the combined market share of is its unlikely to be modified to work on older oss similarly unless theres dev whos also stuck on himself and desperate to use google market share like that is barely worth most devs efforts to create 3rd party app if theres features in newer platform versions that would make things easier for them your best bet is to use the web interface at http google com as the google for mobile page specifically states that that is compatible with android and up
11379 you have main options use web based google through your browser or root your phone and put custom rom that has android v2 or higher if you are willing to do the latter then google around or search here on http forum xda developers com find your device in the master list and try to find root and rom instructions there chances are if you have g1 my touch cliq or any of the old devices you will find instructions on how to get rom happy rooting
11392 there is droidstack which allows to browse the questions users tags and monitor for statuschanges but it does not allow you to question yourself or write an answer but you can open the current question user whatever in your favorite browser anytime this comes closest to writing there are other tools with similar restrictions but think droidstack is the best of the ones tested so far the problem is that writing to any se site is currently not allowed via api only via webinterface writesupport is planned for api version and will be bound to other reputationlevels then via web as stated in announcing api version on stackapps com
11397 not direct answer but there is an effort underway to improve the mobile versions of the stack exchange sites https meta stackexchange com questions stack exchange mobile theme beta starts now have used my android browser to interact with the stack exchange sites and it works pretty well
11401 each version of android since has been developed with specific codename these codenames are chosen alphabetically and have thus far all been dessert items or generically sweet sugary foods some codenames are associated with more than one version number while others are limited to only specific one and the reason for this inconsistency is not currently known the naming typically appears to correspond to changes in the developer api levels but this is not always true example and are both honeycomb but they have different api levels the following names are used for the currently existing android releases note that versions and were not publicly named however android was internally referred to as petit four noted in traroths answer confirmed here cupcake android donut android eclair android android froyo short for frozen yogurt android gingerbread android honeycomb android android android ice cream sandwich android jelly bean android android android kitkat android lollipop android android marshmallow android nougat official name https twitter com android status android android oreo android android pie android
11404 eldarerathis summarized it very well to add some things the version was internally called petit four by google and thats how it all began google is installing giant pastry on their lawn at mountain view each time new version is about to be launched you can see pictures of that display at different stages here donut android logo nexus one cupcake eclair froyo gingerbread icecream sandwich honeycomb kitkat jellybean lollipop marshmallow nougat oreo
11482 think found the problem like bjoernz said some application is creating many objects from mediaplayer class and its not releasing that after so opened an adb shell became root su and found the pid process id of mediaserver using the command ps grep mediaserver the mediaservers pid in my case is then listed all resources used by that pid with the command lsof grep and got the following result so it became easy to identify that the official twitter application com twitter android apk was the problem then removed twitter application and installed tweetdeck instead and the problem disappeared since last week hope this can help you
11535 if you sign up to google you can do this with the google app now there is an instant upload option in the app this syncs any photos and videos if you set the option to an instant upload album in picasa
11576 phoneusage keeps track of how much data you use each day and gives nice display of which apps used how much data here is an example of what mine looked like this month click to enlarge the image note it only starts tracking after installation
11648 cyanogenmod has exactly this feature but without faking data only failing if the app accesses the api proposition for faking the imei was rejected faking other data like contacts is currently under discussion

11762 you cant remove them without root theyre installed to directory that cannot be accessed without root however you can do the next best thing close your eyes stick your fingers in your ears and go la la la la pretending they dont exist the way to do this is to get launcher such as adw if memory serves that allows you to hide icons in that case they will still be installed and if something triggers them theyll pop up but at least you wont have to look at them any more
11764 your best bet would be to go with either launcherpro https market android com detailsid com fede launcher my personal favorite or adw https market android com detailsid org adw launcher both provide customization to the dock set of icons at the bottom number of homescreens transitions app drawer effects as well as custom themes and widgets note there are free versions of both but the paid versions add more features while you can cover up some of what samsung has done things like the notification bar and lockscreen arent affected by these apps in some cases rooting and or installing custom roms would be required to manipulate them
11779 think the sgs2 has newer version of touchwiz than my original sgs vibrant but hopefully you can still customize those icons dont have my phone on me but believe the process is open the app drawer press the menu button select view type choose customizable grid press the menu button again choose edit exit the app drawer return to the home screen you can now drag icons off the dock and drag new ones on
11896 not an absolute solution to your problem but there is an app in the android market which caters to your needs it also necessarily requires better knowledge about permissions and also rooted device permissions denied is an app which allows you to effectively control the permissions that apps which are installed onto your phone via the market or some other source also be aware that denying an app permission that it is requesting may result in the app force closing hence requiring you to have better knowledge on how to use it note this app requires root access this app will not work on all device

12209 ruby has not been ported to android though you might want to check out ruboto for simple editing there are few options but dont believe emacs has been ported either there are no market results anyways rooting might provide you the ability to run linux on your phone but android is not linux its kernel is largely based on the linux kernel but thats about it you cannot run any linux application with gui on android it would need to be rewritten im not sure to what extent native command line apps would need to be rewriten though of course they would need to be recompiled android also does not have full java vm
12257 if you have tasker installed then create an application context for the camera app create task to set system volume down to zero when you exit the camera app the system volume is restored to its original state
12271 looks like the icon for the silent or vibrate mode these icons are different depending on the skin manufacturers carriers put on their phone but those wavy lines usually represent vibration
12272 the third table in this page mentions vibrate https motorola global portal custhelp com app answers detail id droid phone status notifications even though the first table clearly depicts different icon for the vibration mode although with the same zigzag pattern the pattern is also the same as the icon have for vibration mode on my sgs cheers
12286 this has recently become feature in the native gmail app
12307 you may also use adb to remove applications but the application methods are easier since use of adb does not require market this will work for users who are rooted but who cannot or do not wish to use android market or similar marketplaces adb remount root is required to remount system read write adb shell cd system app to see whats installed pm list packages to remove package rm packagename apk pm uninstall class name of package cyanogenmod as far as can tell only requires the rm step not the pm step if you are running de odexed version of android you may only need the rm step if you are concerned you might need the application in the future over the air updates you can use adb pull to copy the apk to your desktop instead of moving it to another location on your phone or just mv the apk to your usd card or usb storage see http wiki cyanogenmod com wiki barebones for more information
12321 as matthew read noted in comment yes it is the entire data directory is simply deleted console2 adb shell ls data data com chessclock android lib shared prefs console2 adb uninstall com chessclock android success console2 adb shell ls data data com chessclock android ls data data com chessclock android no such file or directory reinstalled from the market at this point console2 adb shell ls data data com chessclock android lib the shared prefs directory is absent in the last ls listing because didnt launch the app only reinstalled it therefore there were no preferences yet created for it it sets defaults on the first launch point this out only because it illustrates that the preferences from the previous install were not retained anywhere
12328 this is probably obvious but some apps that have the permission modify delete usb storage may use the internal memory for caches etc and may not necessarily remove the data once the app is deleted ive seen apps to write in not so obvious directories like sdcard data package name but mostly they use sdcard app name which is easy to spot and delete
12346 as far as know you cannot download directly from the web market but you can find many apps on other app sites
12348 you cannot download apk files from http play google com store there are other ways to get apps alternative markets developer sites and you can install them manually provided you can turn on the unknown sources setting
12414 one thing you could potentially do is get the android market on the android emulator which dont think your supposed to be able to do but some people have done it in the past and download the apk onto the emulator then you can find the data in data app apk on the emulator pull it off with adb and install it on your device with adb but like the other answers would recommend finding other stores or developer websites to buy the app first
12504 it looks like theres been little work porting svnkit to android see this but actual source code isnt sitting around for anyone to use yet its little bit incredibly gross but you could try introducing another syncing setup something like dropbox to store and sync files on your phone and then commit the changes when you get to machine with an svn client this is obviously less than ideal
12526 have an original motorola droid that no longer has phone service but it works great as wifi device it does almost everything except make phone calls and texts android market works amazon app store works google maps has feature look under the labs menu to pre cache mile square areas of map then you can see where you are even when you dont have an internet connection ive even had it navigate somewhere with me as long as it has wifi coverage at the start and as long as dont go off course browser works wifi analyzer works its still great device even if its wifi only
12539 try the market enabler app download the apk and side load it it allows you to spoof your region so that the market thinks youre in the us as an alternative you may want to see if this app is available via other distribution methods such as from other reputable markets amazon appstore slideme org getjar com etc also reaching out to the developer can sometimes help
12579 holding down the key will get you menu of extra characters to type saw the there update recently check with the beta version of swype and noticed that the had moved to r4 key but my original answer is still valid for the version of swype built into my phone future versions of swype may move special keys around and you may need to hunt them down
12609 edit now personally use androidlost in addition to everything listed below there is also an androidlost jupstart app that will launch the service remotely if your phone is already lost without any locating software on it its pretty sweet read smses read the latest smses from your phone and send them to your email remote control alarm have you ever misplaced your phone which was put on silent mode now you may sound the alarm on your phone from your pc view on map find the location of your phone on map with androidlost you can find your phone with gps precision even if the phone is indoor you will get nearby location by network accuracy send smses from your pc you can send smses directly from your phone by typing them on androidlost all replies will still go to your phone lock the phone you can lock and unlock the phone from the web if you forget your pincode you can simply overwrite it or remove it by entering an empty pincode on the web wipe the phone dont want your personal messages in the hands of anyone else with androidlost you may wipe the entire phone so all smses contact and google setup is removed pop up messages on the phone send message to the friendly guy who have found your phone so you may let him know where to give it back forward your calls you can send keys to the dialer of your phone that way you can forward your calls from your mobile to nearby phone no battery use androidlost will not use any battery since it does not poll any server to find out if it is lost it uses the latest technology from google to send messages to the phone no pre installation required you didnt install androidlost on your phone no problem you can push the androidlost app to your phone from google market and initiate the connection to googles servers by sending an sms with the message androidlost register to your phone read status detect how much battery is left display imei sim card id and much more sms commands you can set up phonenumber which can control you phone start the alarm by sending an sms to your phone erase sd card click button and your sd card will be erased very useful if you have some naughty pictures on your sd card sim card changed when the sim card is changed an email will be sent to the owner of the phone hidden sms when the phone receives an sms it plays sound and displays an icon in the notification bar but if it starts with androidlost it will not play any sound and not display any notification call list list of incomming and outgoing calls will be sent to your email camera androidlost can take pictures with the front facing camera in case the phone is stolen only for android tablets honeycomb think have fixed it so androidlost works on tablets the call functions will obviously fail if the tablet have no phone installed text to speech you can make your phone speak out load suppose you have lost it on caf then you can make the phone say am lost please pick me up multiple phones on the same account here are some others you can use seekdroid does the following locate your device remotely enable gps display its location on map audible alarm even on silent custom message lock device custom code retrieve recent calls remotely wipe entire phone remotely wipe sd card hide from app drawer disable app from being uninstalled virtually no battery drain works without sim card reteive sim id imei and active phone number and watchdroidpro does the following get your phone position by network or gps retrieve current sim information useful when someone put another sim card in your phone share your position to friend sim substitute protection make it ringing even if the ringer is off wipe data lock your device all of these should do what youre looking for
12611 prey is possibly another option dont see remote wipe feature but there are these two features listed no unauthorized access fully lock down your pc making it unusable unless specific password is entered the guy wont be able to do thing keep your data safe hide your outlook or thunderbird data and optionally remove your stored passwords so no one will be able to look into your stuff
12612 lookout premium is another option it offers the ability to lock and or wipe your device remotely lookout premium is month
12617 no to do this would broadly speaking require multiple wifi interfaces or specialized software which is not readily available or easily installable on android in general this is done on linux using something like hostapd in master mode dont believe that is easily setup on any android phone
12654 does it just display not charging or is it really not charging my galaxy tab also shows not charging when plugged in to the notebooks usb port but after couple of hours much longer than with the charger it is full charged over at the apple sister site there is an explanation why the ipad displays not charging guess this applies to android devices as well if you could see the screen while the ipad was asleep it might even display the charging icon it the modern day does the refrigerator light stay on when close the door mystery there is another answer that explains why charging is slower on computers usb port than when connected to the charger itself
12656 the best way to get galaxy tab charge from usb connection to pc is to turn it off this way it charges and shows charging it just takes time because the power available on usb is limited

12751 with droid locator you have the following options your phone sends its location information in terms of tower info and or gps co ordinates as sms the moment it detects change of sim card in essence if someone tries to use your phone after stealing it to all the numbers registered in the app as broadcast numbers other than this you can also find the locations of remote phones who are also using droid locator you can also share your current location with your friends via mail bluetooth or post your location info as google map images the only drawback to this simple and nifty utility is the ads but of course you cannot blame the developer for this android market link
12759 quick search on the market found number of these here are few that seem to fit your description bus stop alarm bus snooze gps alarm location reminder alarm gps alarm gps alarm
12767 according to the user manual page in my pdf viewer actual page that means your gps is on in use you can check your system settings to disable location services usually settings location and security
12768 according to the manual warning pdf file for the phone page it is the gps icon screenshot
12784 llama laymans version of tasker it can do so much more but should suffice with minimal battery impact as it uses cell sites to identify rather than gps
12816 youll be in the clear for the most part factory reset my moto droid v1 few months back and while it is little scary to do total wipe like that you really have very little to lose like you say youll be able to redownload any app that you have previously purchased and your contacts mail should sync back up just fine it is little frightening to see the commissioning screen on first boot but youll get past that quickly like you had tried clearing out as much as could and getting lean but still saw big performance boost after resetting one thing you will want to be certain to do is save any text or mms messages that you have received to your sd card these get stored in system memory by default and will be erased if you dont save them to the sd card first you can save an image attached to text by long pressing the image youll get pop up with the option to save it to your sd card
12821 had often done factory reset sometimes unwillingly because the beta rom that were using came crashing all the way through id say the longer you have working phone the harder it is when you wiped them out you might not have noticed all the little tweaks youve done here and there in many apps that you will suddenly realize when you do factory reset some of these tweaks may be obscure or difficult to reproduce make sure you take note that you know how to redo all those tweaks most of google apps data and contacts is pretty much safely backed up to the cloud but sms mms is not still havent figured out why google havent added sms backup by default although there are sms sync apps that will backup your sms to gmail wifi passwords are wiped out and custom wifi certificates as well make sure you have them check all the applications you used regularly if they have settings backup most home screen replacement apps have it and many other popular apps as well game history are pretty much out except perhaps for online games make sure you remember the logins for all of them its easy to forget them since you usually dont do login to your phone on the assumption that phone is personal non shared device if you have large cache of email contacts and other synced stuffs and you dont have large data plan then make sure to do the syncing on wifi
12827 press volume up power at the same time it will reboot the phone tested on galaxy captivate
12843 for contacts and calendar entries move the contacts to the google cloud with google sync then activate the android device with the same account note if you created more than one google calendar you will need to make sure theyre all selected for sync on the phone open the calendar app menu more calendars not sure about notes sms bookmarks although if you can get the bookmarks off of symbian and into chrome you can use chrome marks or chrome to phone to move them to android
12854 as devnul3 has said using google for the contacts and calendar was using google as an exchange account so didnt have to do anything special just set your android up with the same google account moving smss can be done with sms migrator which can be found in the android market theres also the spb migration tool which looks like it can do everything but notes
12858 google docsdrive allows collaborative editing between phone app and webapp updates typically propogate from one to the other within few seconds and just appear in the document on the updated device with markup to show that it came from someone else use it for brainstorming sessions with my colleagues on the go like it better than sms email because its easier to see what theyre talking about their text appears in the pertinent part of the document
12925 dont think its possible since the data is sent through the cell network and not through traditional wi fi style internet connection
12927 it could be done technically afaik all communication between mms enabled components is done via standard tcp ip but in regular provider setup the mms store and forward servers mmsc are only reachable via the providers network thats why you can not send and receive mms via wifi its also the reason why you can not make call and send receive an mms simultaneously when you have only 2g gprs edge connectivity normally android will drop the gsm data connection if there is wifi connectivity and all data will be routed through the wifi interface but there is one exception the mms traffic will still go through the mobile data connection
12964 id suggest you plug your phone into pc with the sdk or at least adb installed and in debugging mode after this write script that goes through your apps and installs them via adb adb install path to app1 apk
12966 on typical linux system the cache is cleared by running etc init nscd restart but at least my rom doesnt use nscd to cache dns you can check if yours does but doubt it ive seen suggestions that clearing the brower cache would clear dns cache too but one sure way is to do hard reboot shutdown remove battery for 30s reattach battery and boot
12978 in adb shell or terminal emulator and most likely over ssh you can use the pm utility to install apps the command is pm install sdcard app1 apk the following are the switches of pm usage pm list path install uninstall pm list packages filter pm list permission groups pm list permissions group pm list instrumentation target package pm list features pm list libraries pm path package pm install installer package name path pm uninstall package pm clear package pm enable package or component pm disable package or component pm setinstalllocation auto internal external the list packages command prints all packages optionally only those whose package name contains the text in filter options see their associated file filter to include disbled packages filter to include enabled packages also include uninstalled packages the list permission groups command prints all known permission groups the list permissions command prints all known permissions optionally only those in group options organize by group print all information short summary only list dangerous permissions list only the permissions users will see the list instrumentation command prints all instrumentations or only those that target specified package options see their associated file the list features command prints all features of the system the path command prints the path to the apk of package the install command installs package to the system options install the package with forward lock reinstall an exisiting app keeping its data allow test apks to be installed specify the installer package name install package on sdcard install package on internal flash the uninstall command removes package from the system options keep the data and cache directories around after the package removal the clear command deletes all data associated with package the enable and disable commands change the enabled state of given package or component written as package class the getinstalllocation command gets the current install location auto let system decide the best location internal install on internal device storage external install on external media the setinstalllocation command changes the default install location auto let system decide the best location internal install on internal device storage external install on external media for example you can force the app to install directly to the external storage froyo gingerbread style the wget utility should be available via busybox on cm7 if not you can always install it via android market
13006 if you dont mind paying few bucks highly recommend tasker this automation utility allows you to set up many built in and some 3rd party app android actions based on various parameters including time of day in tasker you will need to create separate profiles and to each add actions 1st action will be identical in both profiles disabling the auto brightness second one will be similar time based action to change the display brightness with time of day and brightness level being the differences start tasker and tap the button on the bottom the main screen to create new profile give it descriptive name such as brightness down for example choose the time context on the presented menu for the from option select the time of day you wish to have brightness lowered un check the to option and tap the green accept button on the task selection dialog tap the new task button and name it lower screen brightness and tap the accept button tap the button to add an action select display category select the auto brightness action select the off option on the set drop down and press the green accept button tap the button to add another action select display category elect the display brightness action set the desirable low level being the lowest recommended setting ensure that both ignore current level and immediate effect options are checked and tap the green accept button tap the green accept button on the task edit screen on the main screen tap the brightness down profile once then tap on its wrench button and select the clone option tap the newly cloned profile tap its wrench button select the rename option and name it brightness up tap on the clock icon select the edit option change the from time to the time of day when youd like brightness increased and tap the green accept button now tap on the task itself name you gave it in step select rename option name it increase screen brightness and tap the green accept button tap the task again and select the edit option tap on the display brightness action set the level to higher setting and tap the green accept button tap the green accept button on the task edit screen ensure that on the main screen the button on bottom right reads on and exit the tasker app you should now be all set
13009 not sure what phone youve got but most of the higher end android phones have light sensors and you can set the screen to adjust its brightness automatically depending on the ambient light at the time if youve got the power bar widget on your home screen its one of the built in android widgets since donut just tap the far right brightness icon until it shows an for automatic brightness alternatively go into settings display brightness and tick the automatic brightness option
13046 holding the volume down button on most android devices from the home screen will drop to silent mode
13064 just read review of screen cast screen recorder thats pretty compelling it requires root like any on device solution im aware of but can record decent quality video at up to fps the review has example captures from various games and the videos are good enough for most anything youd want unless you need hd video for some reason the app has free trial so definitely recommend trying it out
13209 you almost always lose root when installing an ota update would keep an eye on rootzwiki or droidforums for someone to confirm that it can be rooted or someone to release rooted update
13212 yes what cheuer said installing an ota while youre running customized rom in any way even just rooted pretty much always screws up root sometimes even having high risk of bricking your phone never install an ota update while running customized software if you ever want to go back to stock software you need to go find the thread for your phone rom that tells you how to do this only after reverting back to stock should you attempt an ota install lastly note that after an ota update you arent always guaranteed to be able to root your phone again sometimes youre stuck unrooted
13215 lookout mobile has blogged about this due to the diginotar events and provided some pretty good read lengthy instructions which you can find here the gist of it is that you need to pull system etc security cacerts bks and then remove the cas from the store then push the store back to the device and reboot their instructions require that you have bouncy castle for decrypting the store root access and working adb connection im not sure if this applies to all versions of android or not but my guess would be that the location of the ca store hasnt changed in quite some time if ever
13256 dont forget about getjar this market got its first big break when rovio announced angry birds would be exclusive to them when it first launched
13280 aldiko is an ebook reader that reads pdfs as well remember the last page you were at and on top of that allows you to set bookmarks something that adobe reader and most other readers tried wont let you do bookmarks are must have for me so chose aldiko
13292 sorry to bump an old question but you can now make both audio and video calls from android with google talk if you have gingerbread or higher
13336 connect your phone in developer mode via usb and start an adb shell adb shell if you see at the beginning of the line your phone is rooted if its try to execute the su command and if you get now your phone is rooted but if you get an error that su cant be found its probably not or the su binary is simply missing there are also apps on the market that test if your phone is rooted
13338 you should see the superuser application in the app tray most rooting methods add this app to manage the superuser rights it appeared for me when rooted my desire not all do so just try to install and run superuser from the market if it fails you arent rooted
13339 there is an application available in the market called root checker that can verify if your phone is rooted and if you have busybox installed
13349 use terminal emulator popular free open source terminal emulator is android terminal emulator available from droid or play market open the emulator and type su you will know with the message that appears after if phone is rooted or not edit there is an app just for this now root checker
13376 there are quite few apps in the market which will lock certain apps behind password search in the market for applock should find most of them havent actually used any so cant give you recommendation but these should allow you to lock the market and settings apps behind pin number to keep your kids out of them
13409 well the best option to this is to use an app called zoodle kid mode this is available in the android market and is free of cost the app has ability to run your phone in kid mode while in kid mode the kids wont be able to make calls browse internet uninstall apps and anything which can harm your phone you can use the following link to take look at it https market android com detailsid com zoodles kidmode
13418 think the answer here is in all practicability no one hypothetical alternative would be usb host support and to mount an external hard drive or thumb drive onto your phone this would mean doing something like this how to mount external hard drive to your xoom this seems impractical and potentially dangerous who knows if that otg cable might cause short the sgs may not even recognize the cable or the drive and the apk may not work with your phone thats the best answer have on actually connecting via usb to storage location actual streaming from pc via the usb port though even if there were way itd probably require extensive work on both the phone and the computer wouldnt better and way easier solution be to buy wireless usb adapter and set it to ad hoc mode and ssid non broadcast just thought
13509 you could turn on usb tethering then run some media server like vlc carefully configured with rtsp streaming on your local server then open up the stock browser on android type in your local ip prefixed with rtsp protocol instead of http of the pc followed by the port number as set in vlc or equivalent the android media player should launch if all is set and should start to play the video the local ip must be the ip of the pc running vlc or equivalent media server youll need to find it through right clicking the active lan connection of usb tether status ip address do disable firewalls or add exclusions appropriately for this to work also set the vlc with proper video transcoding format that your android can play warning you might want to disable data pack when enabling the usb tether to avoid incurring unwanted costs
13522 stock android doesnt offer ability to disallow apps use of specific permissions at install time once you agree to accept whatever permissions the app requests you are stuck with them unless you uninstall the app since you are rooted you can try using tasker to automate enabling of gps only when using certain apps like maps and disabling it when the app exits this way you can keep gps disabled so that facebook and any other apps dont automatically lock in on you also the cyanogenmod custom rom does have this feature here is step by step installation guide on installing it on your milestone in cm7 on the manage applications settings when you tap on any app you can tap on any permission to revoke it it will get crossed out tap it again to undo the change keep in mind that although apps usually handle absence of internet or gps permissions gracefully some more basic permissions writing reading to from sd card might cause the app to crash or become unstable
13523 an app like permissions denied requires root can help with that it says it doesnt work on every device and rom but there are other similar apps that might if this doesnt do the trick for you generally you could also unpack the apk edit the androidmanifest xml file to remove permissions repack everything and install that modified version im not sure if it works for signed apps are there encrypted apps though cant currently find the guide had read to do this it may also be against the terms of use and so on so make sure you know and take responsibility for what youre doing
13526 similar to permissions denied mentioned by matthew is lbe privacy guard which also allows you to selectively disable permissions for apps also good for disabling geo tagging on your photos as well as preventing facebook and or twitter from broadcasting your location
13546 merge exists in cm edit the contact select join if its not in its regression
13564 changing your google password will prevent the phone from syncing with your google account but will not remove data already on the device
13838 the volume up power option also works for the samsung galaxy you have to hold for about seconds before restart but it works
13853 biggest battery killer for me is being in place with little or no cell signal and having the cell antenna on the phone is constantly trying to connect with the network and it just sucks the battery dry when im at work cant get any signal in my office so put the thing in airplane mode cant make or receive calls anyway so might as well easily end the day with battery if forget to do that im out of juice by early afternoon
13863 usually get by the day by carrying usb charger since always have my laptop or other computers around me some people get through by buying second battery pack or thick extended battery any apps that syncs every minutes is battery sucker since it prevents the phone from sleeping syncing every hour or so shouldnt affect battery by much if possible you should prefer apps that uses c2dm push instead of poll many apps that polls for data have configurable polling frequency try to have the same polling frequency for all apps or integer multiples for mailboxes that need to receive occasional urgent emails dont use the stock email client instead use gmail client or exchange which uses push if your email server supports imap idle extension push extension for imap protocol you should use third party imap client k9 mail however dont use push for low priority high traffic mailbox you might be able to find sweet spot for yourself by using two or more mailboxes for your high urgency and high traffic mailbox if youre rooted underclock most phones have much more cpu than is needed for daily usage underclocking will curb the phone to not go full power state unexpectedly remember to restore the clock before doing cpu intensive activities games and to underclock it again afterwards hope you know to disable live wallpaper theyre good for showing off but not if you want your phone to last the day secure the phone in your pocket found that my phone drains battery faster when in tight pocket since the hardware button are often accidentally pressed which activates the screen and prevents the phone from sleeping in some custom rom cyanogenmod the notification bar have power widget which is handy for quickly enabling disabling battery sucking features gps 3g etc however remember that in the end its all tradeoff
13864 there are two apps juice defender and woofi which when used together can dramatically increase the battery life of your phone the idea is that if you dont need to be notified the instant that you receive message via the internet your mobile data doesnt need to be on all the time juice defender among other things will disable your mobile internet and then re enable it at specified interval so that your phone will check for new notifications it does not affect text messages and phone calls woofi uses your network location as basis to disable and enable wifi so that you only have your wifi antenna turned on when you are somewhere you can use it if you are control freak like me you could also do all of this with tasker have it set up so that when my screen turns off all internet connections are disabled until turn the screen back on then if it does not connect to wifi within seconds wifi is diabled it turns data on every minutes to notify me if receive an email put shortcut to enable disable this on my homescreen and my battery life almost doubled finally if you just flashed new rom your battery life will be bad for the first week or so until the dalvik cache and battery information caches are built up you should notice significant boost in battery life after few days
13894 the newest versions of superuser support using pin to approve root access for apps in other words whenever an app requests root you need to enter your pin before root access is granted this is more or less foolproof no app should be able to get root access on its own or through you clicking the wrong button without it exploiting some bug in superuser or the system and if its doing that you might be screwed even without root
13995 as many others have said you cannot download directly from the market android phones with google experience maintain connection to googles servers it is over this channel that google tells your phone to download install the apk alternative markets websites are certainly options please note it can be hard to determine if the application has not been modified from the market version you can also use usb networking or wifi usb networking may require root if you have to pay for the application on the market but dont on the other website thats sign that the application is probably not supposed to be there it is at best an illegal copy and at worst loaded with malware amazons free app of the day and getjar gold apps promotions are example of exceptions to this
14047 id say that there are only mod specific solutions nearly every app that know uses this android api and therefore the code snipped in your questions for network connectivity checks one would need to change the cyanogen source so that the os android cyanogen is aware of the usb reverse tethering network connectivity and returns the right information to app requesting the current network state dont believe that this can be done with some artificial layer between the api and the app that fools the app into this its more realistic that cyanogen implements the handling of reverse tethering by imitating an active wifi connection you should ask them to address this topic maybe in the future android has official support for reverse tethering
14106 dont think that this is possible see matthews post but lets have lock on how environment getexternalstoragedirectory returns the external storage directory quick look in android os environment java shows that all this method does is returning static constant file member called external storage directory this constant is initialized by private static final file external storage directory getdirectory external storage sdcard which calls getdirectory static file getdirectorystring variablename string defaultpath string path system getenvvariablename return path null new filedefaultpath new filepath so the external storage directory is nothing else then an java system environment variable or predefined default you could try to follow this trace further maybe the external storage directory is just hard coded path in some configuration file on the filesystem or maybe there is way to read out these environment variables via adb that dont know
14109 adb shell echo external storage all credit goes to flow for leading me to experiment and find this naturally you can use cd external storage or whatever else you might need during an adb shell session or from terminal emulator
14166 on the htc evo3d you may press lock button and home button at same time to capture screenshot fyi the lock button is the same thing as the power button
14170 some phones have the functionality built in such as the previous mentioned galaxy on the droid charge hold the back button and press home on most new lg android phones hold home and press power unfortunately the only universal method is using the android sdk to take screenshots with computer rooting and using screenshot app works on many devices but sometimes not and its not the easiest way to take screenshot
14182 as of mid the android market supports multiple accounts to add another account press menu button select settings accounts and sync tap on add account and add your another gmail account to activate or use another gmail account in the market open the new market app and select accounts list will pop up showing all your gmail accounts that you ve added in accounts and sync select the one of your choice and you re good to go from http www theandroidsoul com multiple accounts sign in logins supported in the latest android market v3
14220 these are accessibility apps one of motorolas faq questions summarizes their purposes well kickback check to vibrate the phone briefly as feedback as you navigate the phone user interface press buttons and so on talkback check to cause an installed speech synthesizer to speak the labels or names of items as you navigate the phone user interface soundback check to play sound as you navigate the phone user interface
14221 kickback soundback talkback are googles accessibility offerings to turn them on go to settings accessibility they allow users with low vision to navigate around android by reading out and giving noises vibrating feedback when buttons are pressed or new notifications are shown
14232 on the optimus black you can also use the lock home button
14250 the most popular method is replacing the built in hosts files with one that forces dns queries to well known ad servers to result in localhost this effectively blocks most common ads and most of the google ads in applications the downside is that applications can tell that ads are being blocked and can either refuse to run or otherwise degrade their usefulness while the ad blocking is in effect also root access is required to replace the hosts file beyond that havent seen anything that can selectively block web requests for arbitrary apps for some programs that only use internet access for ads you could use firewall app to prevent them from accessing the internet or if your rom supports it like the latest cyanogenmod revoke the internet access permission from the app again root access is generally required to set up system wide app level firewall or replace your rom
14261 you can also use firewall or permissions limiting application droidwall or lbe privacy guard for example to limit internet access for particular applications these also require root
14264 there are two different apps adfree android and adaway that block ads theoretically in all applications you must have rooted phone in order to use these adfree android works by nullifying requests to known host names in the system hosts file which is essentially an automated solution of modifying the hosts file brought up by another user here it appears that adaway does the same thing if you do not have rooted phone you can at the very least use the firefox browser with the adblock plus addon installed via firefox
14265 as you maybe already know for each application that currently is default application for something say pdf viewer you can reset this default in the application settings settings applications manage applications your app clear defaults after this the next time you perform the action open pdf popup will appear letting you choose new default as far as know this is all you can do with stock android there are however 3rd party apps that give you an overview of the currently set default applications for common things default app manager
14381 no it wont cause any damage any generic charger will do use generic car charger like that all the time
14383 usb mini usb and micro usb cables are standardized the voltage and amperage are the same across all standard compliant usb chargers as long as the charger is standard generic micro usb charger then it should be alright that doesnt make it impossible for manufacturer to create non standard plug that looks like usb plug but theyre pretty much screwed up if they do so
14419 micro usb is standard size and pinout so it will provide the power on the right pins no matter what charger that you plug into the device usually any charger that has the micro usb plug will work additionally in most modern batteries there are lot of charging safeties inside the device itself including overvolting undervolting charging too quickly charging when the battery is too hot or too cold and reverse polarity would be surprised if it would be possible to buy charger on the market today which would ruin phone
14431 android and newer the preferred way is to download the sdk and use adb logcat requires to activate developer options on device there are apps available for viewing the full system log however they only work on rooted devices or require issuing manual command via adb to make them work for more information view see this question android and older you can either download the sdk and use adb logcat or get logcat extrem from the google play store which shows the log directly on your phone
14491 the newest version of the market allows you to rate apps now im not sure exactly when it was released but it was rolled out to the motorola xoom as part of the 4g lte upgrade theres an xda thread for the new version which has discussion about installing it on other devices got the update when my xoom was upgraded so im not sure about stability and the like im not positive if it requires specific version of android to work or if it will work on all versions of honeycomb rating works pretty much like the phone version you go to the apps page on the market and there is rate review link on the left side of the page
14531 im seeing conflicting information one resource says its hardcoded so not something you can change user side android specific init programs are found in device system init add log messages to help you debug potential problems with the log macro defined in device system init init the init program directly mounts all filesystems and devices using either hard coded file names or device names generated by probing the sysfs filesystem thereby eliminating the need for etc fstab file in android elsewhere etc vold fstab and etc vold conf are mentioned have them on my device under cm but im not sure of how they are used
14532 dont think about android as heavily modified linux distribution because its not the nearly only thing that android shares with linux distribution is the kernel and even this component is modified also other core components like the libc differ android has no etc fstab you dont need etc fstab to mount an partition but there is iirc no mount command either dev mount should work root required to answer your questions title all startup system mounting is done with the etc vold fstab helper script
14554 while this is standard cover your assets boilerplate the truth is you can charge your phone off of pretty much any usb charger out there as long as the following things are true the output specification is 5v dc and at least 500ma if its more 700ma 1000ma you are generally fine the phone will only draw what it needs my htc magics official charger is 5vdc 700ma the data pins in the charger are shorted most modern chargers will work if an iphone charges off the usb plug with its cable it means the data pins are shorted if you use car charger do not get the cheap ones car power is lot noisier than household current and you need charger that can survive crank starting the engine if you live in country where power is unreliable you may want to charge off ups or other power conditioner have charged successfully with garmin gps watch charging brick the charger from an older smartphone freerunner and the usb outlets at southwest airlines waiting terminals although id turn off usb debugging and usb mass storage before using public usb charging kiosk if you dont trust it dont use it phones are expensive if your device doesnt charge off of usb pandigital novel check the plug size and the output specification if your device uses funny plug nook color its microusb yes except that their plug in their cable is longer then you need that cable
14577 you cant download apk from market android com but getjar has lots of app and you can download it to your pc
14591 mockdroid is another academic firmware with data faking capabilities
14596 broadly speaking if you have usb cable that only connects pins then you will get power and no data best buy was selling cables like that as universal usb charging cables while back not sure if they still do likewise if you have cable with only you will get data but no power if youre curious heres wikipedia page with the standard usb pinout note micro uses the same pinout as usb
14646 in last versions of android at least in nexus its kinda hard to set mp3 as ringtone there was an option before in the menus called set as but in the new music app it disappeared what you can do is copy your mp3 to sdcard media audio ringtones that ringtones folder might be empty or even not exist in this case just create it then you go to settings sound phone ringtone and select your mp3 from the list good luck
14650 this isnt the correct way but imo its good way use ringdroid with it you can cut suitable part of the mp3 to be used as ringtone this way you can get rid of those pesky intros on songs that have slow start and save space by not having the entire mp3 duplicate in your ringtones folder
14686 theres nothing at present that can do all that siri does depending on your needs you might be able to get close lifehacker had an article about your current alternatives how to get siri like personal assistant on your android phone for free to summarize youll need one of the following or combination google voice actions for android vlingo edwin speaktoit assistant update terryk2 points out iris currently in alpha testing which is by the developers own admission direct response to siri
14700 you do not have to use shift if you hold down the key for longer time it will insert its alt key question mark
14704 the fastest way ive found is to actually swipe from the or keys directly to the space bar thatll insert punctuation mark and then space in the same fashion you can insert period or comma the other similar shortcut use creates an by swiping from the apostrophe to the some similar suggestions can be found in swypes online reference specifically in the swype gestures section of http www swype com tips advanced tips
14728 while still in alpha it may be worth checking out iris its got limited set of siris functionality but it looks like it could be interesting to watch it grow
14743 starting with android ice cream sandwich there is finally possibility to create screen shot without 3rd party app or connected computer press the following two keys at the same time volume down power note that it is crucial to press both keys nearly the same time if your press and hold volume down and afterwards press power it will not work tested on galaxy nexus however some screens are protected and therefore can not be captured some system settings dialogs

14785 on samsung galaxy ii its simultaneously pressing the power home button its tricky though out of times cant get it obviously thats specific to that model of phone and not the android os as far as know there isnt any native app built in to the os for all phones its too bad really this is also applicable for the samsung galaxy s4 i9505 samsung edition
14821 we are working on superosr discussion here http forum xda developers com showthread phpp post18609103 full list of cyanogen and other alternatives here http forum xda developers com showthread phpt all chacha roms seem to have some bugs but otherwise quite stable you could also take the latest official rom and remove stuff you dont use there are some already prepared but you can also do such modifications yourself make sure to learn to use backup restore before you start
14911 the site freeware lovers collects freeware android apps and has old versions for many of the apps they host also for blackberry symbian and palm os
14914 the safe and correct way to get an older version is contacting the developer maybe they will just give it to you or maybe not there is reason why they updated it in the first place most importantly they will want to know why and you wont get any hacked malware version as is possible from other sources
14921 some alternative repositories such as droid allow you to choose which version you want to download all versions ever offered are in the repository for most other sites including the android market the latest version is all that is available
14930 if youre asking whether installing cyanogenmod will void your warranty the answer is yes flashing rom has much greater potential for harming your device than the average rooting method its not necessary to root in order to install cm in some cases but usually it is and cm itself comes pre rooted if you want to find out more about cm you should go to their website
14931 for of devices you have to have custom recovery image installed on the device in order to install cyanogenmod and usually to do that you have to have the device rooted so you have to have rooted device before you can install cyanogenmod cyanogenmod comes rooted and yes it is an android release rooting device while it will void your warranty is not really that bad think of it like having access to the administrator account on your pc as opposed to limited user account you also have to keep in mind that cyanogenmod does not work on all android devices you can only install it on devices that are supported
14943 with just the stock android experience no that is until ice cream sandwich is released thats not to say that oems havent added their own changes that do allow for launching the camera app without unlocking or perhaps clever developer making change to the lockscreen
14945 you could use widgetlocker and have shortcut on your lockscreen to your camera havent personally tried this but it should technically work
14951 you cant reinstall all you can do is just simply uninstall it and install again
14953 as far as know theres no way to tell the market to reinstall an app was hoping you could do it through the market website but just tried and it refused to install an already installed app which bothers me because my phone and the website will definitely be out of sync regularly do too many third party restores and so on that said you could clear the data for the market settings applications manage applications all market force close clear data and reboot your phone then start up the market again and look to see whether the update is available again or not if its not then you can trust that the latest version is installed since it grabbed that info directly from the system and if not you can attempt the update again
14960 an app consists of dex files apk files data files and libraries when you install apps in sd card not all of the parts of the apps are kept in sd card some of them remains in internal storage however if you have rooted phone you can use program like link2sd to move all the pieces of app to sd card edit you can use program like app2sd to easily see what program can be moved to sd card you can manually move shown apps or ignore some of them if you go to settings applications manage applications the size shown there is the size its taking in the internal storage this is just my guess based on the calculations performed by noting the free space on internal storage moving some apps to sd card and subtracting only the reduced space of the apps im sorry didnt mention you need second partition for link2sd to work but if you had given hint in your question that you were willing to root id have talked in more depth about it also your main question was whether apps moved to sd card should take internal storage or not it wasnt about link2sd the term just came while answering anyways beside second partition you are recommended class sd card ive written blog post about using link2sd here you might find it useful
14979 the answer is that you have to use standard computer log into your google account step verified google account go to authorise applications and sites and set up your android device google have said that step verification will not work yet on android so they have provided this work around for now here is the link where you create password to authorize your device https accounts google com issuedauthsubtokens they will then give you password which you can enter into your phone allowing you to keep step verification enabled
14982 you could use the diskusage app to see how much space the dalvik cache takes up my understanding is the cache doesnt move when the app moves to sd combining that size with the data size should give good idea as to how much will remain on the internal memory
15048 actually the info method does work while the control is greyed out under wireless settings the taskbar icon still shows bt connectivity and have tested and confirmed that bt is still active on my og droid
15051 first turn off your phones radio by entering airplane mode usually thisll be by long pressing the power button and selecting airplane mode next on your homescreen press menu and click settings or navigate in your preferred way in settings choose sd card phone storage press unmount to dismount your sd card now remove your sd card from the phone and insert it into your card reader on your pc copy all the files to folder of choice insert your new gb card into your cell phone and choose to format it from within the device this is the safest course of action remove the new sd card and use your pc to move overwrite all data from the copy of the old card to the new one re insert your new card into the phone and reboot so that the scanning of the card takes place
15129 as uri herrera commented youll need to root your phone to be able to install custom firmware and then install community aftermarket firmware like cyanogenmod most likely the open source community will keep updating the firmware rom even after oem has lost interest how to root you can refer to nice guide by lifehacker most likely it can be easily done by connecting the device with usb and using windows program called superoneclick how to install custom firmware the easiest way is most likely to use the android program called rom manager its available from android market the premium version will even notify when your custom rom gets updates so its easy to keep up to date
15130 once manufacturer abandons supporting the device your only choice is rooting it unlocking its bootloader if possible and installing custom roms google only releases the android source code into aosp android open source project and has no say whether or not the manufacturer or carrier will update given device the only exception is the nexus line of phones that are supported by google directly as it stands aosp cannot be built for any non google device without major work even though manufacturers and carriers are required to provide the source code it is true only for the part of the os they dont have to and rarely do provide sources for the proprietary drivers which are necessary to build completely working android version for given device the community developers usually use the drivers from older os versions which greatly limits the upgrade potential the drivers sometimes are reverse engineered which gives greater flexibility to developers there also is an issue of locked down bootloaders on most new android phones and tablets which limits the extent of the changes custom rom can bring most manufacturers and carriers lock bootloaders to prevent people from bricking their devices there are ways to unlock bypass such locks for many devices though bottom line is that if you are looking for device that will be supported the longest your best choice is nexus line otherwise suggest looking at various online forums xda developers or rootzwiki for example to see if there is enough interest in your device from community developers to produce custom roms for it
15186 found that catlog displays the android log little bit better then alogcat besides adb logcat thats what am using
15355 supporting multiple users has been discussed before and think that it is something that is needed as well if buy tablet and set it up for my email calendar etc dont want that device to be community device which would mean that multiple tablets would be needed in family household problem with being able to support multiple users is the space required if each user had their own settings then the data data would have to be much larger to support these extra users but not only settings it would have to support all the apps installed by the user too so data would have to be much larger too you couldnt use the same apps between users because the paid apps are tied to the account that bought them think this will eventually happen but much larger storage would be needed for the devices as it is my device consistently fills the data cache and have to clear that out because of the number of apps have installed now just imagine have or more users using the same device and where do you set the limit on the number of users that can use one device there are adults and teenagers in my household so that is people that could potentially be using one device actually experience issues with google tv about this very topic as well it doesnt currently have gmail or apps like that installed but can log in to gmail via chrome browser and then if someone else comes and uses the tv browser now am logged in dont actually do this but noticed it to be an issue with services like youtube and such update google has been hard at work starting to implement this no actually information on when it will be available but the start of the foundation has been laid in the lockpatternkeyguardview is the following code public void onuserchangedint userid mlockpatternutils setcurrentuseruserid updatescreengetinitialmode true so multi user support is coming at some point update with the announcement of jellybean multi user support is available but only on tablets
15385 gps itself does not need network connection to any server to work it just needs signal from least gps satellites to calculate good position fix there is also the gps almanac which basically provides future data on where the satellites are expected to be in given time in the future usually up to days this can be used to speed up the position calculation the almanac is broadcasted by the gps satellites and it takes up to minutes to download the full almanac via the gps system thats why there are also servers on the internet that provide the almanac data in an more convenient faster way maybe thats what you meant by gps server android makes use of that too
15393 gps all gps systems get signals from the satellites they never send data to the gps satellites your phone would need much larger antenna to send signal to them systems like onstar do send your position back to their servers google servers do get your position information so they can calculate directions and pull in the tiles for the map the us government does not charge for the use of gps it is global
15649 solved this by erasing all contacts on the sim heres how contacts app menu view uncheck all but sim press ok menu delete menu select all press delete after while all sim contacts are gone now re enable showing the phone and or google contacts and youre good to go my phone uses swedish so maybe the menu items buttons above have other similar names
15702 the android development document tasks and back stack actually covers this pretty nicely relevant excerpt task is cohesive unit that can move to the background when users begin new task or go to the home screen via the home key while in the background all the activities in the task are stopped but the back stack for the task remains intact the task has simply lost focus while another task takes place as shown in figure task can then return to the foreground so users can pick up where they left off suppose for example that the current task task has three activities in its stack two under the current activity the user presses the home key then starts new application from the application launcher when the home screen appears task goes into the background when the new application starts the system starts task for that application task with its own stack of activities after interacting with that application the user returns home again and selects the application that originally started task now task comes to the foreground all three activities in its stack are intact and the activity at the top of the stack resumes at this point the user can also switch back to task by going home and selecting the application icon that started that task or by touching and holding the home key to reveal recent tasks and selecting one this is an example of multitasking on android note multiple tasks can be held in the background at once however if the user is running many background tasks at the same time the system might begin destroying background activities in order to recover memory causing the activity states to be lost see the following section about activity state summary the task is moved to the background when you press home and sits in memory not really doing anything and retaining its state this means that generally speaking you can switch back to the task and it will pick up where it left off however the android system can and will kill background tasks if it needs to reclaim memory when and if this happens is entirely up to the system and is probably why you see inconsistent behavior when resuming if the task is destroyed by the system it will have to be re created when you launch it again so unless the application author has taken measures to save the applications state during the destroy process it will be lost and saving exact state in things like games is fairly impractical another good but also verbose document is the one covering the activity lifecycle theres nice flowchart if you scroll down bit
15703 pressing the home switches you from the app to the home screen whilst leaving your app running in the background this is bit like switching between windows on windows pc except that when your phone is running low on resources like memory it will start to close apps that are running in the background so that your phone has enough resources for what youre trying to do now games are often amongst the first apps the phone will kill to save resources as they often use lot more memory and cpu than other apps this is why sometimes your game is still running paused and sometimes android has closed it for you the back button is the way to close apps so that they are actually closed see also what is the right way to close apps in android
15704 pressing the home key allows the user to start new task by showing the launcher all active tasks and therefore activities incl your air control example will call their onpause method it is up to the app and their activity to restore the exact previous state when it comes back visible it is also possible that the apps process gets killed while the activity is backgrounded but this should not affect the users experience the user should not be able to tell difference if an activity was just paused or if it also was killed this could explain the different behavior of air control which could be hint of an faulty implementation of the android lifecycle management
15749 my reputation is still too low on this site to vote up so im answering to emphaisze flows answer keep running into this issue in one of my apps have various spinner controls and you have to explicitly save their state in onpause and then restore the states in onresume android doesnt remember their states automatically another complication is that sometimes android will call an apps oncreate function when you only expect it to call onresume so your issue with air control or any other app is specific to that app and you should report the behavior to the developer for correction most apps have contact email in the market btw if you want to understand app life cycle recommend chapter of ed burnettes hello android especially figure
15758 alright finally got it after spending while digging through android forums this thread explains how to clear the cache partition after doing that this thread explains several ways to get the update to trigger again the one that worked for me was to temporarily set the date one year in the past
15802 sounds like the phone simply froze up try taking out the battery putting it back in and then press the power button to start it
15803 did you wait some time after the power cord was pluged in it is normal that this takes some time to show the charging screen if the battery is not charged at all for full factory reset that is the most reset that can be done by the galaxy you want to boot into recovery mode by powering off the device and then booting it by holding down the volume up home power keys menu should appear that offers the factory reset option
15827 if you control the network you may be able to configure your dhcp server to always assign the same ip for your phones mac address this has the advantage of working even if you for example do factory reset of the phone or otherwise revert the wifi settings my linksys e2000 router supports this via button labelled dhcp reservation on the basic setup screen and any host based dhcp server would allow this as well
15898 you could also try mtpfs or gmtp mtpfs allows to mount the mtp device as filesystem while gmtp is standalone program over at askubuntu theres an answer that shows how to use mtpfs
15933 had the same problem solved it by clearing defaults in my gallery application
15950 roxan is incorrect it is not safe to remove stock rom apps if you do so any future updates from your carrier manufacturer will not install much safer method is to use an app like titanium backup to freeze the apps preventing them from being seen by the system and running being updated if you really feel the need to uninstall them you can use titanium backup to back them up first requires root that way you can restore them from backup in the future if you need to apply rom update
15954 there have been times that havent been able to install an app from the market on the phone but have been able to get it to download by using the market site on my computer bt telling it to install the app usually the app starts downloading almost immediately that wont work if the router network you are using is blocking access for some reason but the app should install as soon as you are on network that will allow downloads you might try cleaning your market data and cache when you fire up the market you will have to accept the terms again
15960 see this page on the cyanogenmod wiki which gives pretty detailed analysis of what apps are safe to remove from the os

16024 thats got it all covered pretty good but couple of things should be pointed out one feature of rom manager backup current rom is useful in that it integrates all of your apps including paid ones all of your data such as contacts text messages saved photos browser bookmarks and your system state your desktop arrangement your preferences your app defaults and rolls them up with your rom into complete system image your current rom thats great if something goes screwy with new rom but its not the way to restore apps and preferences after upgrading your firmware unless you want to go back to your old firmware too titanium backup will backup or restore your entire app set in single batch process or you can wait for android market to restore your apps as for non market apps you can use android mate to individually save each app to sd as an installable apk the first thing long time android user does when faced with an fc is open up rom manager and run fix permissions cannot overstate how valuable that function is
16027 if you lock message when you delete conversation with locked message every message other than the locked message will be erased from that conversation
16160 there is an open ticket to the gmail application team via the android project to address this please vote for the issue if you wish to see html signature support in the native gmail application http code google com android issues detailid
16163 the only way to do this in android is to do hard reboot the necessary command line tools are not normally available however in my tests hard reboot has always done the trick for me galaxy nexus and htc desire various roms this is pain but it is quicker than the 10min cache timeout
16182 one current work around would be to create draft in gmail that has the signature and use it in the mobile app
16194 addresses are cached for seconds minutes by default failed lookups are cached for seconds from everything ive seen theres nothing built in to flush the cache this is apparently reported bug in android because of the way it stores dns cache clearing the browser cache doesnt touch the dns the hard reset clears it because it simply times out can we ask the underlying reason for needing to clear the dns cache perhaps theres another solution thats missed because were not looking at the bigger picture
16237 currently you cant disable notifications via speakers while still having them via headphones theres an open issue for that you also can use llama or tasker to switch profiles when you plug your headphones
16251 enabling usb debugging essentially starts up the adb daemon on your device which allows it to communicate with adb on another device to enable debugging commands its used when developing and debugging applications and allows you primarily to transfer data between computer and your device both ways read log data easily from logcat debug applications including breakpoints and heap monitoring install and uninstall applications access stripped down shell on the device for command line interaction leaving it enabled all the time will have negligible impact on battery if any at all some other things to consider about leaving it on or not pro if your device has hardware problem that prevents you from accessing the screen usb debugging could be helpful in recovering data especially on rooted device pro you can install applications reboot your device and generally do some other convenient things without having to actually interact with your device physically even with the screen locked off pro on rooted device it may be possible to regain entry if you have forgotten the screen lock password pin pattern also potential con see below pro you can take advantage of port forwarding over usb debugging to use tethering apps like pdanet believe thats how its implemented since it does require it con if your device is lost or stolen an unscrupulous individual could attempt to steal data from the device regardless of whether or not youve got screen lock if youre rooted they can get pretty much everything con recall reading that some devices can have trouble with accessing the sd card as mass storage device when usb debugging is enabled ive personally never seen this issue but have seen people allege that it was problem see also using hardware devices from the android sdk documentation which discusses debugging applications on physical devices rather than the emulator there is also documentation page regarding the android debug bridge adb which explains its purpose and its commands
16317 on your phones home launcher go to menu settings applications and look for anything that contains carrier iq iq or possibly com carrieriq iqagent if you are rooted it appears that this app will check and see if it exists on your phone the paid license key will also let you remove it from your phone this app was made by trevor eckhart the person who discovered this vulnerability if you are not rooted this app will attempt to detect carrier iq on your phone and here is another app by lookout that will detect for carrier iq on your phone also if you are rooted and running custom os such as cyanogenmod you should have no worries about carrier iq carrier iq is bundled by the manufacturer carrier and shouldnt be included in rom such as cyanogenmod as long as it is built from the aosp and is not derivation of manufactuers rom
16347 verizon claims that their phones are carrier iq free
16348 when got the upgrade on my sony ericsson arc from holding down the power button brings up the airplane mode power off silent menu and new to is the presence of take screenshot button as well
16380 found solution for the local file browser problem on my xoom tablet tried opening local file with opera by typing file mnt sdcard documents blabla html opera changed the adress in file localhost mnt documents using the localhost syntax on the android browser opened the local file
16527 the people who make lookout now have carrier iq detector available in the market note it just detects it it does not offer any tools to remove it for which you would need root anyway
16699 the overall outlook is not so great for you afaik the market has content filtering check the settings in the market app for the browser thats wholly different kettle of fish the built in browser doesnt have any kind of filtering available 3rd party browsers might but theyll be trivial to sidestep by simply opening the built in browser the next best thing you can do is filter the tablets at the router if it allows for that however thats only useful when theyre at home or other places where you can control their internet connection
16731 in the mean time got up and in case someone needs another solution now use power widgets to toggle screen lock on and off manually when am on my home network use wifi unlocker to keep the screen lock turned off while the connection is on works very nice edit after upgrading to simply started using built in android profiles screen lock types can be set there and can then be easily switched through the long press power button menu
16740 this isnt really manageable from technical perspective you could go some way towards it by sorting out your own firmware using something like cyanogen as we often point out over on security stackexchange com once an attacker in this case your children have device they control it so my alternate course of action would be as detailed in this question over on parenting stackexchange start off with visibility using the devices together and education that will go much further towards making your children safe than any technical control you can implement what have done with my now and was let them use computers in the main room while we were there aged and then unsupervised until about but knowing we would be walking in and out and over years old trust them not to be stupid it helps that their dad is security and privacy specialist who often provides awareness training in this area
16851 etc hosts is in this context is really only good for blacklisting for whitelisting youd be best off using proxy server and then setting your device to use it in your devices network settings you can subscribe to an existing proxy server service or set up your own at home that should be enough info to get you googling to the answers you need ive added little more detail to this answer on your original thread fyi using proxy server does not require rooting
16852 etc hosts doesnt allow wildcards see here https serverfault com questions in my etc hosts file on linux osx how do do wildcard subdomain two more links about etc hosts howto configure your hosts file http www linuxhomenetworking com wiki index php quick howto ch03 linux networking configuring your 2fetc 2fhosts file large example file with nice intro header http someonewhocares org hosts small android app that allows you to add an entry to the hosts file requires root https market android com detailsid com pof add2hosts
16863 as noted in your other thread your best bet is probably to manually set web proxy server via the devices network settings that filters by keyword or whitelists even if they do go to another persons house or try to get on another network they will be unable to browse especially if you are hosting the proxy server yourself on your own network in that case they most likely wont be able to browse to anything at all from wikipedia in computer networks proxy server is server computer system or an application that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers client connects to the proxy server requesting some service such as file connection web page or other resource available from different server the proxy server evaluates the request according to its filtering rules for example it may filter traffic by ip address or protocol if the request is validated by the filter the proxy provides the resource by connecting to the relevant server and requesting the service on behalf of the client proxy server may optionally alter the clients request or the servers response and sometimes it may serve the request without contacting the specified server in this case it caches responses from the remote server and returns subsequent requests for the same content directly

17153 manufacturer websites while they dont usually host roms directlyexceptions include samsung you may find that they have software useful for upgrading stock roms such as samsungs tool kies if you want to upgrade and stay stock then you should try official methods first google flagship updates google hosts update packages for the flagship nexus and pixel devices at https android clients google com packages you cant browse that link directly but web search is your friend here search for that link plus the code name of the device and the version you want for example searching android clients google com packages crespo ics results in lot of pages with this link n1 the ota ice cream sandwich update for the mobile nexus links for various factory images for nexus devices can be found here xda forums probably the first place you should look after trying the official route is the xda developers forums stock roms are usually posted in the general sub forum for your device and custom roms in the android development sub forum for your device no guarantees they dont have dedicated subforums for all devices so if you have less popular device you should use the site search instead of the subforum search rootzwiki forums you may or may not want to check rootzwiki before xda forums above developers tend to move from forum to forum and rootzwiki provides devices for the best developers so lot have jumped on board they have sections for many devices and for those that dont there is general section the forums tend to be divided into sections per device not always general development roms and such and themes rom manager many developers publish their custom roms in rom manager and even provide ota style updates through it naturally these roms can be easily flashed through rom manager clockworkmod recovery as well android forums this site often has roms for more obscure devices as well as the popular ones pdadb this site provides long list about pages for all kind of devices including android blackberry symbian and more it misses filtering mechanism unfortunately theunlockr grouped by vendor then device seems to be quite up to date and quite complete for sure one of the best resources android modaco similar to android forums sammobile this site posts stock samsung roms from all over it does require you to sign up google when in doubt do web search make use of quotes vibrant stock in order to narrow the results and find what you need shipped roms collection of shipped roms contains roms for odd devices miui translated from popular chinese rom miui is highly customized version of android with large base of customization and theme options and strong ios aesthetic available for many devices and in froyo gingerbread ice cream sandwich jelly bean options aokp android open kang project aokp is just like cyanogen mod cm android open source project aosp based rom aokp focuses on providing extensible settings with the disadvantage that less devices are supported in comparison with cm samdroid board if you have samsung device and you want to unleash the potential of your device then this is the place to go for information tutorials files firmware and many surprises many top devs in the industry and talented people frequent and maintain many useful threads on this forum based site android central another popular android forum similar to xda and rootzwiki omnirom similar to cyanogenmod omnirom is committed open source project that provides roms for variety of devices replicant similar to omnirom replicant is committed open source project that provides roms for several devices mostly samsung it is fully free android distribution with marked aversion to binary blobs putting the emphasis on freedom and privacy security lineage os lineage os is the successor to cyanogenmodin the sense that the numbering scheme matches only it allows for customization of the buttons at the bottom of the screen and for root access flashtool for sony xperia flashtool provides inbuilt tool xperiafirm that lets you download the stock firmware for xperia devices using flashtool you can even install the downloaded firmware onto your xperia device
17197 mostly it lets you choose when to install it so that you can make sure you phone is plugged in during the update so as not to tie up your phone for few minutes if you need it usually you should install an update as soon as its convenient to do so
17202 phone updates are an odd thing manufacturers decide if the phone is capable of handling the update based on the devices hardware and carriers decide when to push the updates to the handsets there are exceptions such as wifi only devices where it is solely up to the manufacturer however system updates are generally good thing these updates bring bug fixes security patches and general improvements to the android experience there have been some bad updates that have broke existing features but these have been fixed within few days and are few and far between on recent devices but how to decide if you are hesitant at all to install the update do some searching for the device and update technology sites such as gizmodo and engadget post updates to many devices especially if the update introduces problems there are also many android specific blogs that post information of patches and updates if no one is reporting problems then the update should be fine to install
17211 it means that wi fi connection is strongly recommended to download them this is usually because the apps are very large such as world of goo which is mb the newest version of the market v3 as of writing displays warning that lets you download it anyway but think that older versions just wouldnt let you download at all via cellular connection not positive on that but seem to recall seeing it myself
17212 it means you can only download those apps when your phone is on wifi connection if youre on 3g and you attempt to load one of those tried cordy youd get the following message download required wi fi this download may be too large to be made over mobile connection it is likely to remain paused until you are on wi fi
17225 there should have been warning when you begin the encryption that you had to agree to the only way to unencrypt it is to perform factory reset thereby wiping your data partition completely
17329 use program called volume free works pretty well the free one is capped though at db if you want to go higher you have to get the paid version the full version can be found for free on the developers website
17345 you can set up the market on fire but only if you have root by doing the following guide originally from this xda thread prerequisites root your kindle fire download the following apks googleservicesframework apk vending apk latest version see here for apk downloads complete gapps zip file root explorer app or similar that lets you change ro rw permissions side loading apps activated on kindle fire on the kindle fire settings screen go to device and turn on allow installation of application from unknown sources instructions transfer the apk files to your kindle fire via pc mac remember where you put them open root explorer app and navigate to the transferred apk files select the googleserviceframework apk and install when complete click done and return to the file location for vending apk long press vending apk and select the move option on pop up menu navigate to system app folder change mount option from ro to rw read only to read write paste vending apk into the system app folder long press vending apk and select permissions from pop up menu change permissions to match all other apps in this folder rw install vending apk reboot your kindle fire you can also use adb instead of file manager to perform all of these steps simply use adb install apk to install an apk file to move vending apk to system app youd probably need to first push it to the sdcard adb push vending apk sdcard and then copy it over from root shell cp sdcard vending apk system app when changing permissions you would need to use chmod system app vending apk from root shell to remount the system partition as read write you would need to execute mount rwremount dev block platform mmci omap hs by name system system from root shell after performing the above steps the market wont appear in your apps list or on your carousel you can work around this by either installing 3rd party launcher or by using the market opener app which basically just bootstraps it
17372 try default app manager pro default app manager lite they work superbly and make life little easier
17383 here is the ultimate answer first on your phone install terminal emulator from android market then run cat proc cpuinfo which will show you the detailed processor information of your phone arm5 in my case afterwards you need to install an arm5 cross compiler environment on your linux box download ubuntu and virtualbox if you are windows mac freak and dont have linux box in order to compile native code for your phone you do this in order to be able to start privilege escalation attack on your phone so next you need to cross compile privilege escalation attack for arm5 htc hero microprocessor for that use the rageagainstthecage attack made by sebastian krahmer of suse linux berlin in binary only reverse engineered here http pastebin com fxsgij3n precompiled version is available here http cmw 22aaf3 com common rageagainstthecage arm5 zip download the android sdk starter kit from google install the appropriate android platform sdk version for me http developer android com sdk index html then download the superuser su package http cmw 22aaf3 com common su efgh zip put all the superuser package the su program and the rageagainstthecage exploit in the same folder as adb program to connect to your android phone from the android sdk you need to enable usb debugging and switch of internet sharing next you transmit the file rageagainstthecage bin to folder data local tmp on your phone initially as normal user you have write access only to the sdcard and the temp folder but this is sufficient adb push rageagainstthecage bin data local tmp then you start shell on your phone adb shell and change ownership on rageagainstthecage bin to all chmod data local tmp rageagainstthecage bin next you start rageagainstthecage on your phone as normal user data local tmp rageagainstthecage when the exploit finished your adb connection should terminate if it doesnt type exit adb kill server adb start server now connect again to your phone adb shell adb shell now runs with escalated privileges root so now remount the file system so you can write on the system partition mount remountrw yaffs2 dev block mtdblock3 system exit now push su and superuser to your phone remember you have write access now adb push su system xbin adb push superuser apk system app and then change ownership on su to all adb shell chmod system xbin su next download and install one of all those free tether apps that require you to root your phone start superuser now start your tether app popup will appear which will ask you whether you want to grant this app root access say yes and check remember now switch of your phone and restart when it has restarted everything is back to normal no more root privileges but su is still there and executable for everyone so when logged in start the wifi tether app since you checked remember in the superuser app it will use su to switch this application to root which means it will now run fine with only the tether app with root privileges next connect with your linux box to your brand new working android wifi hotspot after youre sure it works dont forget to put access restrictions for the hotspot in place btw if you use your escalated privileges to export some apk packages for reverse engineering you will notice that android lacks the cp command you can circumvent that restriction by using cat copy cat instead cat data app superuser apk sdcard downloads superuser apk
17440 was searching for way to increase the volume on my phone before realized the quietness was because my ear buds needed cleaning used an old toothbrush and rubbing alcohol to clean mine made everything much louder
17560 was also looking for something like this but then found out solution that works for me while on call click home button and go to contacts and add new contact the active call stays in notifications and you can bring it back up anytime

17604 harass me by samuel tardieu available from google play store does what you want tired of missing extra urgent calls because you forgot to switch your phone off silent mode this application will turn the volume on if the same number tries to call you times in minutes configurable
17614 the easiest way to do this is use google music and specifically the google music manager go to music google com and download the music manager it will run in the background on your computer and upload everything in itunes including new downloads purchases to google music finally just download the google music app to your android and you are all set few caveats this seems to be one way sync so deleting file from itunes will not delete from google music or vice versa the google music app on android is little different from itunes iphone model the music is not automatically downloaded to the phone unless you explicitly set it up that way by default you have to stream the music which requires an internet connection apple drmed content cannot be uploaded to google music and therefore wont be transfered using this method
17674 was able to set up pair of tasker profiles that raises the volume to particular level when second call comes in from the same number within five minute interval its fairly specific it only acts if the second call is from the same number as the most recent missed call doesnt reset the volume after the call etc but it could be starting point first profile context state missed call tasks set variable missedcallnumber to called number wait minutes clear variable missedcallnumber second profile context phone ringing caller missedcallnumber tasks set ringer volume to
17746 isnt really an answer but there is wifi analyzer which shows more information on the wireless networks your device can reach it gives you more detail than the average user would require as far as know there is no application available on android yet that can sniff packets would be an interesting application to have in the pocket
17761 spent decent amount of time trying to figure this out because dont feel like having the google experience and as far as can tell it isnt possible ive worked around it the droid repository and amazon appstore are both reasonably well maintained either will manage any apps you install which is handy thats where start otherwise track down and download the apk outside of the google run market in many cases the android market will point you to developers web page and contact information if they dont publish the apk on their web page you can always ask for it two answers worth checking out where can find open source android apps what are the alternative android app markets ps dont forget to install apps from apk you have to turn on unknown sources settings applications unknown sources pps once you have the apk on your computer you know you need to turn on usb debugging so you can copy the apk to your phone right settings applications development usb debugging
17762 dont know about manual never found one but how to close programs you dont mean if you want to stop running applications thats under settings applications but otherwise you mostly dont how to switch between open programs are they even open still if you long press the home key you can move between the last few applications you had open how to properly shut the device down when you hold the power key for few seconds you should get few different options depending on your os version powering off is definitely one of those options thats the best way to shut it down what version it is how to upgrade or should find the os version under settings about phone should show kernel version and build number im pretty sure you cant upgrade without rooting it but there are some good insights on rooting your phone right here and no one definitive answer for better or for worse how do root my android device when to use the sd card when to use the internal flash drive for storage thats good question one worth asking looking for answers to here what tasks it is capable of doing google does have some good general material on this one what its limitations are theres no good answer to that one unfortunately what not to do so that dont break it dont throw it from high buildings
17767 there is an app called 3g watchdog it can monitor 3g data transfer and wi fi traffic pretty neat application click image for larger version
17772 complete android guide is pretty good introduction starting point for free on the website available as an ebook or an app on the market http completeandroidguide com
17780 google do actually publish android manuals for each major version unfortunately they do hide them fairly well your phones manufacturer and or your network carrier may also publish manuals for your phone that will include the major changes theyve made from the base android for example lot of manufacturers customize or replace lot of the android ui with their own version such as htcs sense or samsungs touchwiz interface they may also modify replace default apps to work better with their hardware or interface the camera app is often one of these in your case it sounds like the manufacturer unfortunately probably doesnt have an english language manual on the plus side they probably havent done much customization to the base android experience googles android manuals android aka froyo android aka gingerbread android aka honeycomb tablets only not available for phones android aka ice cream sandwich actually galaxy nexus manual but as that device is pretty much pure ics it should be ok
17791 android os versions and above honeycomb ice cream sandwich actually have setting that allows you to specify owner info text that will show up when the device is locked there are also many 3rd party locks creen replacement apps that allow for much greater configuration flexibility than the stock one including the ability to specify any text on the locks creen take look at widgetlocker or go locker for example for the unlocked state you can always modify an image to include the if found text copy it onto the devices sd card or internal storage area and set that as the wallpaper you can use one of the myriad of free image editing software paint net to add the text
17805 google does not provide some apps in the market since theyre intended for approved devices ones that meet googles compatibility guidelines however believe they have special agreement with cyanogenmod where you can flash the apps separately you can read more about how to install these packages at how can install the google apps package play store on my android device
17807 contact owner worked for me give your android chance to call home display your contact information when the device is locked allowing the finder to contact you select yourself or friend from your list of contacts then select which information you want shown
17817 there seems to be problem with the latest cyanogenmod and the german locale possible solutions are some users report that if you search google on your phone for gmail market and open the market link with the market gmail will install use the market enabler to change your mobile provider and download the gmail app manually install the apk from this thread
17872 system apps are apps that are included within the system they are located in the system app folder the vast majority of them are required to make the device run an example of some of these are the dialer which sets up all the network connectivity and browser without which no in app webviews would work
17874 system is read only without root so it prevents uninstalling applications from system app and system priv app applications that are critical are put there so that they cant be uninstalled carrier bloatware that they dont want to let you remove is also put there the latter category of apps can be removed if you are rooted the former not so much system priv app also allows apps installed there to use signatureorsystem and other privileged permissions stephens answer has some examples as for why apps might be critical that depends on the rom htcs sense is heavily dependent on their built in apps from what hear for example they simply didnt design their ui such that it would work natively with third party apps or fail nicely if the system apps were missing other apps are essentially part of the android os but google coded them as apps services probably for encapsulation and reliability reasons updates for some system apps can be downloaded via the play store such as google maps if it didnt come preinstalled as system app on your device then you can use titanium to convert it from user app to system app
17951 there is an excellent tool pdroid its both an app and set of rom patches which enable intercepting and faking permission requests here are the pdroid jellybean rom fork patches

18238 definitely looks like case of airpush this is particularly invasive form of in app advertising that uses the notification bar even if the app utilizing it is not actively running technicaly its not malware but adware although the way it manifests itself certainly blurs the line between the two the only way to stop these ads from appearing in your notification bar is to uninstall the application that came bundled with airpush there are several apps on the market that can help you detect which app uses the airpush so that you can uninstall them edit apparently airpush gave in to the public outcry and are now providing ways to opt out of their invasive ads http www airpush com optout you can either download their opt out app or manually enter your devices unique imei esn meid on their site personally id still uninstall the bundled app since both opt out methods would most likely use bandwidth for connecting to airpush servers to authenticate against their databases
18246 geeksphone started off with the premise of completely open software and hardware stack so far they released two handsets one and zero although both models are severely outdated specifications wise compared to todays high end models the zero model is quite comparable to current mid range devices the company provides source code for the kernel and drivers of their one model on the web site couldnt find the sources for the zero model but im sure they will if you reach out to them
18247 there are at least different free oses aimed at smartphones the replicant project and the shr project both of which are aimed at bringing free as in stallman software to smartphones havent used either of these yet but it looks like replicant is more strict about their definition of free software both of them appear to be actively under development http replicant us http shr project org trac your choice of free os will have list of recommended hardware devices so it may be useful to check out their supported hardware lists before making decision it looks like the nokia n900 and the geeksphones are listed in both and the nexus series from google is at least partly supported
18255 know youre looking for programming apps actually on the phone so this might not be overly helpful found an app called splashtop remote desktop that with wifi connection you can control your computer at home ive tried it for reading documents and playing around however think it could be used to write code using whatever utility you have at home

18343 rooting allows you access to the internal android environment which of course consists of more than just the linux kernel so you are running linux but you should consider it as though you are running under different distribution than say debian or redhat theres different set of standard libraries and some files are in different locations at least on my droid ext2 support is not built in by default there is also no init or cron the full set of linux modules is not available unless you compile them yourself and put then in system lib modules important ones you may miss on standard roms are cifs ext2 tun and others most if not all phones running android are arm cpus so the binaries you run on them must be arm eabi soft float binaries if you have the source you can cross compile whatever utilities you need but read on there are many standard commands and utilities available in the system bin directory such as grep ps cp rm mv ls ip even vi you have enough to get by until you use the linux installer utility to install chrooted debian environment debian has supported arm for while it takes some work but if you can root your phone and have sizeable enough sd card this is the way to go this is close to standard linux system and under it you can install and run ruby of course cpu and ram limitations come into play

18470 video rendering which would have to happen even if the application is not active but still playing is going to use lot more battery then normal usage so if you are not watching the video it stops in order to not waste precious battery power
18472 its not limitation of android but feature of the youtube app to conserver resources if you want to use youtube as music player think you should be able to find an application that allows you to do exactly that in the market tubemate lets you listen to only the audio of youtube file you have to download it in advance though and that should work in the background
18512 if you have no reason to why the wifi drops you might try changing the wifi sleep policy the wifi sleep policy handles when or if the wifi connection shall switch to mobile data if this option is set to the default value when screen turns off wifi connection automatically switches off when the phone has been idle for while you can try setting this to never which will keep the connection on even when the phone is not used to change this setting navigate to settings wireless networks wi fi settings menu advanced wi fi sleep policy
18532 as mentioned in comment it really depends on what app you are using to provide tethering on the stock htc tethering app there is view called manage users which lets you see list of connected devices listed be resolved host name touching each device reveals its hardware address and currently assigned ip address as far as can recall it is the same for the stock samsung s2 at least in this region northern europe
18602 su short for switch user is binary executable its used by android and other nix based systems to allow process to change the user account it is associated with the reason its important from rooting standpoint is that su without any other parameters will switch to the root user meaning that processes that require root permission for their functionality need to invoke su since by default they are not being run by root superuser is an android application apk is an android application package it works as sort of gatekeeper to the su binary applications which attempt to invoke su will be forced to route through superuser which will then prompt the user if it is an unknown or new application the user then has the option of approving or denying the access to su and optionally having superuser remember their decision so it can automatically apply it for subsequent calls by that app by doing this the only apps which are granted root permissions are ones that the user chooses the source of both applications is available on github and can be examined audited by anyone who wishes to look at it superuser here su here you can find further details as well as changelogs on superusers website other related questions on android enthusiasts how exactly does root user access account works do all applications run as root on my phone after rooting what are the security disadvantages of rooting an android phone how do protect my phone from malicious apps once it is rooted

18821 switchme app just appeared featuring profiles for root users the free version is able to manage profiles in order to manage more profiles you need to buy the key for around switchme needs not surprisingly root switchme is unique application for root users that allows you to log in and out of multiple installations of android just as you would on desktop computer the technology behind switchme saves all of your applications and data protects it and stores it as file in memory you can then log out of an account and log into fresh installation of android or another account with its own unique content you may create as many profiles as the memory is capable of holding some of these may require very little free memory because they contain few apps others will be larger as they contain many applications and lots of cache and data
18845 the source code for superuser is available on github the main author of superuser are adam shanks chainsdd and koushik dutta koush also author of clockwork recovery koushik dutta explained in his blog how superuser apk works note that the post is from the very earliest incarnation of the superuser app lot of things have changed since then and some of what was written there are no longer correct for modern superuser su implementation but the basics should still be the same both su and superuser can certainly be replaced by alternatives but it wouldnt really do much as the facility that su uses exec and setuid system calls is available to any executables given that the executable had the proper permission bits setuid bit is set to root at the core su is very simple program it just spawns process as another user the real security check is done by the kernel so as long as youre getting the official unmodified su and superuser app and theyre installed properly with proper permission you dont have anything to worry about theyre open source and safe you can verify the source code yourself at github however it is certainly possible to get trojaned superuser su binary so make sure that wherever youre getting your superuser su binary is trustworthy or compile su superuser yourself if youre truly paranoid
18863 dont want to steal from martin sherburn but this app that he recommended in comment does the trick for me it doesnt keep the screen from lighting up but it does silence the notification
18896 you can install the android sdk and use ddms to monitor the logcat the thing with logcat it is cleared when the device reboots but you may be able to get an idea of what is crashing if you are monitoring it before it reboots you can probably also find unofficial cm9 nightlies for the galaxy s2 but am not sure what issues still exist for that device
18897 the first thing would try to do is to retrieve the logs of the errors via adb and or crash dumps retrieving the logs is tricky since the log cache gets erased on reboot if the phone reboots even while sitting on charger try running adb logcat continuously you will need android sdk and usb drivers installed and configured on your pc when the phone reboots look at the last several pages in the command prompt window for any errors or abnormalities if you cant reproduce the reboots while the phone is hooked up to usb suggest installing an app like alogcat and setting it up to write logs to the sd card on an interval hopefully you will get lucky and catch the errors that way you can also try pulling out the crash dumps via the following commands su cat proc last kmsg mnt sdcard last kmsg this should create file named last kmsg on your sd card that contains last few debugging messages from the kernel open it with any text editor and see if anything obvious shows up
18907 had similar random rebooting problem and after one such reboot hooked up the phone to my laptop and ran adb bugreport on it got what looked like useful information and attached it to the bug so think at least some log information survives reboot heres the bug btw http code google com android issues detailid

18949 it probably has nothing to do with cm the market is just really really bad at updating itself sometimes clearing the data for it will help but sometimes youll additionally need to install newer version manually before it will start updating itself again ive installed the market from android police few times if youre looking for safe file just put it on your sd card or internal storage make sure it has the apk extension and install it via file manager settings applications unknown sources needs to be checked for this
19001 first suggest you stop using your task killers they are draining your battery more than saving it the system is restarting the services when they need to run which is causing battery usage second you are under the assumption that freeing up memory is good thing it is not freeing up memory is not going to decrease battery usage what you really need to look for is the apps that use lot of cpu cycles this is what will drain your battery android is based on linux linux always wants to use all the memory available because free memory is wasted memory the android system will take care of releasing memory of applications that are not in use so other applications can use it when needed even if you try and kill applications that are running and taking up memory the system will either restart these services apps which will cause battery drain because they probably have some syncing that happens when starting up or just the cpu cycles that are used to initialize the application killing the applications will also cause the device to appear slow when trying to start applications because something that normally might be running now needs to be started back up before presenting you with the applications user interface some things that will cause battery drain like gps wifi bluetooth and data usage are going to use your cpu lot more to process the data that is being transmitted and received turning these off when not in use will save on lot of battery drain have bad battery in my device it wont even charge past but can get or more hours out of my battery if turn off these services when dont need them use google maps all the time and in my battery stats its not even listed as an app using resources my highest battery user is the screen and the lowest shown is gmail can assure you google maps is not the cause of your battery drain using task killers is more likely the cause as said use google maps for directions almost daily and it isnt even in the top list of apps that are using my battery more information on task killers from the google android developers blog common misunderstanding about android multitasking is the difference between process and an application in android these are not tightly coupled entities applications may seem present to the user without an actual process currently running the app multiple applications may share processes or one application may make use of multiple processes depending on its needs the processes of an application may be kept around by android even when that application is not actively doing something the fact that you can see an applications process running does not mean the application is running or doing anything it may simply be there because android needed it at some point and has decided that it would be best to keep it around in case it needs it again likewise you may leave an application for little bit and return to it from where you left off and during that time android may have needed to get rid of the process for other things key to how android handles applications in this way is that processes dont shut down cleanly when the user leaves an application its process is kept around in the background allowing it to continue working for example downloading web pages if needed and come immediately to the foreground if the user returns to it if device never runs out of memory then android will keep all of these processes around truly leaving all applications running all of the time of course there is limited amount of memory and to accommodate this android must decide when to get rid of processes that are not needed this leads to androids process lifecycle the rules it uses to decide how important each process is and thus the next one that should be dropped these rules are based on both how important process is for the users current experience as well as how long it has been since the process was last needed by the user once android determines that it needs to remove process it does this brutally simply force killing it the kernel can then immediately reclaim all resources needed by the process without relying on that application being well written and responsive to polite request to exit allowing the kernel to immediately reclaim application resources makes it lot easier to avoid serious out of memory situations if user later returns to an application thats been killed android needs way to re launch it in the same state as it was last seen to preserve the all applications are running all of the time experience this is done by keeping track of the parts of the application the user is aware of the activities and re starting them with information about the last state they were seen in this last state is generated each time the user leaves that part of the application not when it is killed so that the kernel can later freely kill it without depending on the application to respond correctly at that point in some ways androids process management can be seen as form of swap space application processes represent certain amount of in use memory when memory is low some processes can be killed swapped out when those processes are needed again they can be re started from their last saved state swapped in here is another article talking about how task killers will drain your battery do not use automatic task killing software to make long story short using auto task killers can cause excessive battery drain as if the phone doesn drain battery quick enough already the phone to overheat often and programs shutting down crashing randomly programs you actually want to use stay away from these one thing that you could do if you are really set on stopping maps until you want to use it is use the freeze option in titanium backup this will essentially remove the application from the device and none of the services associated with it will ever start until you un freeze it
19002 have you thought about un installing and re installing maps as possible solution first get rid of the pre loaded maps by deleting the system app maps apk file su rm system app maps apk once system app is updated its useless in the system app folder and can be safely deleted then copy the current maps version to your sd card cp data app com google android apps maps apk sdcard now uninstall the maps app pm uninstall com google android apps maps the switch keeps the settings for when you re install the app now to get maps back simply re install it from backup pm install sdcard com google android apps maps apk you can automate these steps via gscript which allows you to create shortcuts to scripts so just create one script named disable maps with the command from step and another one named enable maps with command from step check needs su for both now you can add gscript shortcuts to your home screen from the scripts you created by using androids normal add shortcut method gscript will be one of the options there the only drawback of this method is that you will most likely lose the maps shortcut and or widget from your home screen when you uninstall it requiring you to re add it after re installation you of course will still be able to launch maps from the app drawer
19059 so the problem was market and market updater were not signed by the same key no idea why as result the market wasnt able to send an intent to receiver in the market updater that was protected by signature level permission heres what ive done took marketupdater apk from the device took it apart with apktool apktool marketupdater apk mu then opened the androidmanifest xml changed the package attribute under manifest to package com android vending updateralt that was to avoid name clash with the vanilla market updater app changed the receiver elements header to this receiver android name com android vending updater updatemarketreceiver see no permission attribute no longer requiring that the intent sender is signed by the same certificate spelling out the java package name in android name was necessary since the apk package name no longer matched the java package name of the class then packaged the apk back apktool mu marketupdateralt apk signed the apk using the jarsigner tool with an arbitrary key that had from another project program files java jdk1 bin jarsigner exe verbose digestalg sha1 sigalg md5withrsa keystore path mykeys ks marketupdateralt apk mykey uploaded the apk to system app registered with pm adb push marketupdateralt apk system app adb shell pm install system app marketupdateralt apk and forced market self update removed the preferences file adb shell rm data data com android vending shared prefs then restarted the market waited for five minutes and closed the market the update went through like charm now have market in app billing and all good thing the permission based coupling between the market and market updater was not two way edit the alternative updater apk is available for all at http www jishop com temp marketupdateralt apk
19110 google added new security layer to the android market in february adding new layer to android security today we re revealing service we ve developed codenamed bouncer which provides automated scanning of android market for potentially malicious software without disrupting the user experience of android market or requiring developers to go through an application approval process for further information read here http googlemobile blogspot com android and security html android has added extra security with setting that allows googles security scanner to optionally scan all of your non market ie side loaded apps for malware too the feature is an extension of the security technology google introduced for the play store this past february while that technology worked exclusively on the server side analyzing apps that were uploaded to the play store the new system works with your device and scans any apps you install from third party sources process known as sideloading computerworld inside android 2s powerful new security system

19148 if you mean clearing all app and user data on the phone you can do factory reset via settings privacy factory data reset note that this erases all data on the phone not just app data
19149 you can do factory reset under such case go to settings sd phone storage factory data reset dont think an app without root can do it as apps are limited in their own sandbox
19275 androids shell will support limited amount of unix style shell scripting it specifically should have shell at system bin sh that you can use however the shell provided with android has severely restricted set of commands available to it if you want to do anything even remotely complex youll need busybox install or another shell its generally pretty rare for android apps to provide any kind of command line interface or binaries very much doubt that sugarsync for example allows you to perform sync from the command line if you want bit of gui you may want to look at something like gscript
19290 yes custom recovery works with encrypted honeycomb device the built in encryption doesnt touch rom firmware at all it just encrypts accounts settings downloaded apps their data etc which can be located on phone memory internal sd or external sd thats why encryption is no longer present after factory reset because theres no encrypted data available files for custom recovery environment live on rom as firmware thats why they survive factory reset as flashing files updates has to do with rom youll be allowed to do it when it comes to nandroid backup you can do it too but the chunk of encrypted data will backed up in that form which cant be restored using titanium backup yes you could do nandroid restore flawlessly
19291 there are few android apps that are able to control other android apps and can chain several commands together using their gui in similar way to script they both have plugins to extend their support to many popular android apps and functions tasker and locale are probably the most famous of these see here for some comparison but there are also other similar free apps that you could look at

19441 youll need ts connector for mic only or trrs for headset with mic see this wikipedia article for example this trs to trrs adapter is supposed to work with the galaxy nexus and includes mic im not sure if you would need to plug in headphones for it to work but you could certainly plug them in and not use them you didnt mention bluetooth you could also potentially use bluetooth headset or mic of course it may be the case that the stock camera app wont record audio from the external mic in which case you may need to run separate audio recording app or simply use different video recording app this app looks like it can record audio from headset im sure there are others
19480 today have made some progress in this question on iphone you can buy irig mic which can do the job and it should work on android too but since want to use another external microphone have decided to make the adapter myself from some different adapters which does the same thing as irig mic but with female mm jack output so can use my wireless microphone with it have ordered the parts from an online store in denmark but you can get it all over the internet you just need to know what you need the first thing you need is mm male pole conductor jack trrs to rca adapter like this one then you need rca to either female jack or xlr adapter either if your mic has jack or xlr output like this one and thats all then you can plug everything together and use the mic of your choice on your android phone btw some stock camcorder apps cant use external microphones then just use this camcorder app https market android com detailsid rubberbigpepper lgcamera feature search result w251bgwsmswxldesinj1ymjlcmjpz3blchblci5sz0nhbwvyysjd im using this app with this set of wireless microphones and im just waiting for the last adapter in the mail tomorrow so from tomorrow can record with my galaxy nexus and record the sound via the wireless microphone on distance up too meters and if need to go around with the phone and the microphone will just plug in wired microphone to the female jack and go around with the phone and microphone in my hand hope someone in the future can use this information which was very hard to find on the internet when have some time later today or tomorrow will upload couple pictures to illustrate my setup

19535 no there is no federated xmpp client for android that supports video calling federated because there many proprietary xmpp clients that do so but they work only within their own network the reason because there is no such xmpp client is pretty simple jingle the xep which is used for xmpp video calling is pretty new and most xmpp libraries dont support it yet this is especially true for the most relevant xmpp library smack relevant because its java library smack has some jingle components but the development on them stopped years ago and they dont seem up to date update jingle development in smack gained some traction in the last months
19559 from what understand it is not possible at the time of writing this since almost all the dependencies that are required for emacs to run do not exist on the android system then even if you got all the dependencies to compile for arm and android kernel it would take longer to start up emacs then it would to ssh in to another machine that has emacs available if you want to try you can look at this site that explains what you need to do to compile linux binaries for the android devices and here is how you build emacs

19675 your songs should get saved to sdcard android data com google android music cache music the reason they dont appear when you install new rom is because the folder theyre stored in contains nomedia file which excludes it from the media scanner google music is able to keep track of them because it puts entries into its database which is at data data com google android music databases music db which point to the file specifically anything in the music table with localcopytype value of is song on googles servers which youve downloaded so it will be available offline this disappears if you wipe your data partition when flashing new rom if you have sqlite3 binary on your device you can use the following to get list of all songs that are available offline sqlite3 data data com google android music databases music db sqlite select from music where localcopytype if you want to have your music stored locally across rom installs the easiest thing to do is just to create folder at the root of your sd card named music or similar and put the files in it the media scanner will pick it up that way alternatively you can try removing the nomedia file from the google music cache folder that should allow it be scanned too but dont know if google music will try to re create the file on subsequent launches of the app
19678 no there is no guarantee that the information is stored in the same format between multiple platforms but also there isnt way to browse the data files on ios or access the file system unless you are rooted dont think you have access to where the data files are stored on android either either way you are sort of stuck the game data is stored locally on the devices not on remote server they should store it on server especially now that the game is available to play on both google and facebook as well as the mobile devices
19683 found this thread on xda developers if you have jail broken iphone and rooted android phone you can transfer your progress basically you have to copy two files highscores lua and settings lua from private var mobile applications very long string documents from iphone and replace them on android phone in data data com rovio angrybirds files you also have to fix permission and make sure youve completed at least level in android phone before replacing the two files if you trust yourself you can also use programs like angry birds unlock all level in android and unlock only up to the level youve completed in iphone but you wont have exact score and hidden star collections so though little troublesome the earlier way might be what you want
19714 yes you actually can do this its kind of kludgy looking when you inspect the clipboard but it works just fine first off you can inspect the current clipboard contents with service call clipboard from an adb shell or without shelling in first adb shell service call clipboard it may start out initially blank after reboot for example service call clipboard result parcel 0x00000000 0x00000010 you can put text into the clipboard using service call clipboard which basically takes parameters two ints and the string you want to put on the clipboard service call clipboard i32 i32 s16 hi there result parcel00000000 to be honest im not sure what the first two parameters are one answer on stack overflow has suggested the first int is number of items in the parcel one in this case and that the second is the length of the string however ive used for the second parameter and it works fine and cant find any documentation that matches up with this particular function so take that for what its worth in any case its basically creating parcel object with fields then passing it into the clipboard the clipboard then unpacks the parcel and sets the string value passed in as the clipboards contents you can see this when you go to retrieve the value afterwards service call clipboard result parcel 0x00000000 0x00000010 0x00000020 similarly if you long press on text entry field and hit paste after doing this you will get the text that was set via the call service clipboard line above and it will look completely normal the above examples come from my htc evo running cyanogenmod
19825 there will be an su binary on the device usually in either system xbin or maybe in system bin that is the minimum binary needed for root there may also be an application called superuser this allows applications to request root access and gives you the ability to grant or deny the request samsung can check if the device is rooted not remotely like if you send it in for warranty repair but if it has been rooted it will void your warranty
19829 most samsung android phones and tablets can be restored back to stock firmware via odin or heimdal tools this wipes all traces of rooting or any other kind of system alterations and in most cases is sufficient for sending the device in for in warranty servicing to the carrier of manufacturer however with the galaxy s2 series of devices samsung introduced hidden flash counter which keeps track of how many times such tool has been used community developer actually found where this information is stored and created an app that allows you to reset the counter unfortunately the app only works on ics android right now see this thread on xda developers forum for more details
19937 you cant do this each android application has package name which effectively defines the java dalvik namespace that its classes occupy you cannot have two packages of the same name installed because it would create overlapping namespaces which is why it always replaces the old one when you install new one the only way you could feasibly do this is if you were able to get the source for the app and change all of the package definitions
19995 swiping apps out of the recent apps list is vanilla and yes not well documented this has been the topic of decent amount of discussion on various android forums the consensus seems to be best described here in some comments that the behavior is similar to but not exactly the same as closing an app in general for apps that dont define explicit back button handling its the same thing as hitting back enough times from within an application that you exit out of it the link has some more details on the specifics but overall you can think of it as quitting the application specific to the music app believe it starts service so while the task itself the music app ui may be closed the service continues to run in the background so that your music doesnt suddenly stop just because the task got cleared out for memory management reasons that may have affected what you saw
20068 in ice cream sandwich the old contacts app was now replaced with the people app this new app is meant to keep you connected with all of your contacts not just people you call and it does so in different ways then the old contacts app by hooking in to social networks and things like that the option to only show contacts with phone number is not an option in the new people app but agree that it should be there especially when you are searching for contact when you want to make phone call
20074 as chahk galaxy s2 has flash counter which counts how many times custom rom has been flashed you can reset it with usb jig which works on every version of android usb jig is usb device which allows you to get into download mode remove the yellow triangle reset odin counter reset custom binary counter more detailed information can be found at usb jig faq
20140 if you are familiar with the concepts of read and write permissions on various pc platforms that is pretty much the same as what is going on here you are giving the application write access to your external storage which could be an sd card or some storage space that comes with your device that permission indicates that the application is able to create modify or delete any files that reside on the sd card or the non removable storage space that the the os treats most like an sd card so it could download file from online and manually save it to your sd card it could generate its own image text audio etc file and save it to your sd card it could delete any file on your sd card it could find file that already exists on your sd even one with nothing to do with the app and make changes to it
20141 it means that an application can read write to the entire contents of your sdcard even if the application does not have this permission it will still be able to read from the contents of the sdcard giving it modify write permissions will allow the application to create edit or delete files of the time this is so the application can do things like save data to the sdcard for example this could be images from wallpaper app or if the app is used to backup your sms messages for you or even podcast app needs to save the mp3 file to the sdcard there has been some fuss lately about ios having access to your pictures and other data on the device you have to remember that these devices are not phones they are computers that make phone calls it is no different if install an application on windows linux osx the application will have access to every file on the system that have access to if you dont trust an application to install it on your pc you wouldnt install it you should use the same thoughts with your phone but keep in mind that you may have even more personal information on the phone then you would on your pc
20152 you could simply use bluetooth wifi mouse app like premotedroid there are bunch of others and generally speaking they just allow your device to be used as mouse keyboard input if you can pair with your pc it should work although ive never tried it myself do use premotedroid to pair with and remotely control my xoom though works great another option would be some kind of vnc or remote desktop client but thats not as lightweight and some of them dont support linux splashtop for example doesnt have linux server iirc
20228 at least on my phone it seems you need way more available space thanthe size of the app you are actually trying to upgrade in my case it seems needed to have at least 13mb free space to upgrade anything at all even for 500kb apps some tips to free space go to settings applications manage applications click move to sd card on the ones that have that option in the same list also click clear cache on all your apps your browser cache can not be cleared here so open your browser go to settings and click clear cache in some cases have also been able to manually update apps one at time when update all fails due to insufficient storage
20290 there is no force shutdown as far as know but you can force reboot by holding down the power button for about seconds
20303 if you want to do what is essentially to backup of your device you can use custom recovery to create nandroid backup doing so effectively creates disk images of your nand partitions hence nandroid that you can restore from at later point this is going to vary bit by device and recovery system but in general if you want to perform full backup of your phones internal memory you would need to root your device and install custom recovery the most popular recovery is probably clockworkmod how you install it will vary widely by device but rom manager can do it for you on most popular devices you simply launch rom manager and select flash clockworkmod recovery from the main menu if using clockworkmod open rom manager and select backup current rom this should do all of the work for you if not using rom manager or if you use recovery other than clockworkmod reboot your device into recovery mode this again varies by device but rom manager has reboot into recovery option that works regardless of what recovery you have installed another option is to issue adb reboot recovery from connected pc with adb configured and set up there may be other requirements for getting into recovery depending on your device the kindle fire is very different from others navigate to the backup restore or nandroid menu or similar select backup and if needed select which partitions you would like to back up some recoveries will also give you the option to compress the backup select perform backup or similar and wait for the process to finish once the backup has been performed you should be able to use it to recover from many soft bricks however the two situations you would not be able to recover from with backup alone would be your bootloader is invalid corrupted etc your recovery partition is invalid corrupted etc in both of thse scenarios you would first need to fix the offending partition bootloader or recovery before being able to restore the backup basically anything that prevents you from accessing your recovery partition will also prevent you from using your recovery to restore your backup such situations are would say fairly rare you can use backup to recover bad boot or system partition so flashing kernel or rom should have an extremely small likelihood of permanently bricking your device unless it modifies your recovery or bootloader as noted above you may be able to flash an uncompressed backup from fastboot but this would depend on what recovery you are using and how it performs its backups as recall clockworkmod simply uses dd to create the image and they actually will flash correctly on some devices however would strongly advise researching this before trying as bad fastboot write could soft brick you as well of course as long as you dont try to overwite your bootloader you wont lose access to fastboot so in some ways this could be nothing ventured nothing gained situation to actually restore backup you can in rom manager select manage and restore backups then select the backup you wish to restore from if not using rom manager or not using clockworkmod reboot into recovery select backup restore or nandroid or similar select restore pick the backup you would like to restore from if more than one select the partitions you would like to restore if givent the option select restore and wait for the process to finish nandroid backups are by default stored on your external storage device in pretty much every situation some exceptions may be devices with no separate external storage devices like the galaxy nexus where the sdcard directory is actually on the physical internal storage in any case though it will save to your sdcard directory which is readable from pc as usb mass storage or adb you can copy nandroid backup off of your phone and onto computer for safe keeping then copy it back over later if you need to restore to do this you can simply plug in your device and look for path like sdcard nandroid or sdcard twrp for teamwin recovery possibly elsewhere for others then you can copy the contents of the folder over to your computer alternatively you can pull it with adb by plugging in the device and issuing something akin to adb pull path to backups from pc shell
20324 also had the same problem and it took me days to fix this try going to contacts google com find your profile should have your gmail on email address re add the faulty data it was an old phone number in my case save and force your nexus to sync contacts now delete the faulty data sava and force sync again if that didnt work do the same but with your google profile re add faulty data save and force sync then delete it did both of the above so im not exactly sure which method worked edit just remembered there was one other thing did after all of the above go to google plus app on your nexus click settings and uncheck the contacts syncing the old phone number was removed at this point and turning sync back on did not make it reappear hope that helped
20391 went to settings applications manage applications all chose the market application in the list and clicked on uninstall updates button which appeared there it gave me an old but working version of the market app hope it will update itself in the future and will continue to work properly thanks to matthew for inspiring me to look over there
20458 you can clear learned words under settings language and keyboard user dictionary long press on the learned word and then edit or delete
20465 theres some info in the source code in the classes com android internal policy impl recentapplicationsbackground and com android internal policy impl recentapplicationsdialog if read these correctly there are specific handlers for selecting the apps but nothing special for swiping them except for ondetachedfromwindow which calls com android view ondetachedfromwindow which basically hides the element and clears its data this would hint to the fact that nothing special happens on swiping the app which corresponds with austin mills answer because since the list doesnt show the active app the onpause and other system calls that are done when quitting an application have already happened
20488 following keyboard apps have arrow keys hackers keyboard go keyboard with its pad plugin simply install them hackers keyboard is not liked on smartphones due to its small buttons but as you are on tablet id recommend it to you it has all keys found on pcs physical keyboard including even control alt etc keys take look of it use go keyboard if you want style it supports more layouts themes and languages it supports swipe based input too
20505 any music you purchase via google play store or upload via google music manager application is tied to whichever google account you selected within the app under menu settings google play account starting with android froyo you can add multiple google accounts on android devices phones tablets google tvs etc therefore if your relatives handset tablet supports multiple google accounts you can add your own account under settings accounts sync on their device and then within their play music apps settings you should be able to change the account to yours the music should then be available on their device to stream download
20540 the version of swype pre loaded on most gingerbread galaxy ss does have arrow keys built in swipe your finger across from the swype button in the bottom left corner of the keyboard to the sym button alongside it and you should see the cursor control screen instead just tap the abc button to get back to the normal keyboard the other useful extra keyboard you can get is proper num pad by swiping from the swype key to the key in middle of the keyboard
20638 the keyboard settings shows all supported languages no matter the locale of the device so if language is not listed than its not supported good alternative is anysoftkeyboard you can download language packs for it
20654 think it will do the same as the back button do except one little change it will finish all activity fragments in the app just did little testing with little selfbuild app you can test too heres my testing app https bitbucket org leandros99 lifecycletest download available too for those who cant build in every activity lifecycle method http developer android com reference android app activity html activitylifecycle print the app log you can view it with adb logcat install android sdk cd to platform tools in cmd shell and type adb logcat now you will see everytime you do something like hit back or home button the app prints the lifecycle method mentioned above your question if swipe app from the recent apps drawer the ondestroy method will be called it does nearly the same as the back button hope helped bit if there are questions just ask
20663 appear to have found the magical search terms that led to some explanations from google employees specifically found couple of different places where dianne hackborn explains what happens when you swipe something out of the recent list the first is comment on one of her google posts hat specifically happens when you swipe away recent task is it kills any background or empty processes of the application see http developer android com guide topics fundamentals processes and threads html lifecycle for what this means and uses the new http developer android com reference android app service html ontaskremovedandroid content intent api to tell any services of the application about the task being removed so it can do whatever it thinks is appropriate she also notes in blog comment actually removing an entry in recent tasks will kill any background processes that exist for the process it wont directly causes services to stop however there is an api for them to find out the task was removed to decide if they want this to mean they should stop this is so that removing say the recent task of an mail app wont cause it to stop checking for mail if you really want to completely stop an app you can long press on recent tasks to go to app info and hit force stop there for stop is complete kill of the app all processes are killed all services stopped all notifications removed all alarms removed etc the app is not allowed to launch again until explicitly requested so it looks like the summary is that swiping an app out of the list will first kill all background processes for the app then use ontaskremoved to notify the app that the background task was removed at that point it looks like its up to the app to decide what happens so guess there technically isnt hard and fast rule about what happens to the app beyond that point
20682 not exactly accessing the filesystem but you could try airdroid it has really nice file manager
20693 over wi fi install small app swiftp ftp server original link dead see http ppareit github com swiftp instead just setup username password after tapping start button your device will become ftp server the app will give you url handy if you dont know device ip ftp url format on pc you can use any ftp client software to access file system of device windows explorer works too you can also create network drive in computer for example you can visit this in address bar of windows explorer ftp here is ip of android device is port on which ftp server is working you can configure port in app too visiting it will ask you username password enter what you specified in app done the app will not give you url if device is not connected to pc using external wi fi router but it works in those situation too if youve made device wi fi hotspot connected pc with ad hoc network then youll have to find device ip by yourself ipconfig all command is fine with windows it really works as long as youve ip of device ive tested it by myself just use this ip in ftp url visit it the interesting thing as ftp is universal standard this method will work with any pc mac thats not true for samba file share airdroid etc over bluetooth theres no need of external app if bluetooth software on pc supports obex ftp you can do this directly if youve issues with stock bluetooth services install bluetooth file transfer app it supports both obex ftp and opp means you can do both side file system access device to pc pc to device
20714 would assume its because there are still phone numbers that are distributed with convenience letters phonewords in them and there are probably still automated call answering programs that use them the letters on the numpad far predate t9 for the us specifically wikipedia also has an article that explains the history of telephone numbers and the various ways that letters have been used over time it was different in other countries but cant find detailed article for that at the moment
20760 if youre thinking about installing it id recommend you to use widgetsoid it can sit on homescreen and as notification like in image and it provides lot of toggles which bet no other app provides
20764 thanks lot everyone found it its custom rom called aokp http www forum aokp co
20793 it can be done but not simple for the reasons eldarerathis mentioned you need apktool refer to this guide on how to use it and this on signing the apk after youre done you need to modify the androidmanifest xml file find the line that looks like this manifest package com example app and change it to something like com example app foo after youre finished recompile then resign to restore your data try the following via adb adb rm data data com example app foo adb push data data com example app data data com example app foo where com example app is the package name of the original and com example app foo is the modified theres always slight chance that the app will break or depending on the way the app is structured you may receive dialog every time you change the screen prompting you to choose which app you want to launch but its definitely worth try if you want it badly enough of course the two apps will not share the same settings and data
20794 no its not possible the android market is plagued with issues like this one as of version you can finally now remove applications from the all tab in the my apps list you can even select several apps at once by long pressing one then selecting the others these apps are removed from the website too source android police
20838 simple answer you dont though you can feel free to ask google as user chahk said the web interface saves you few clicks but there is still no way to filter results as you are requesting
20860 to answer your question see this previous question for options on changing the country that the market think your phone is in how can circumvent regional restrictions in the android market for the second part of your question about which country to change to from the apps description currently for and canada based phones only but from this description the application dials to our service which dials to the other party showing your phone number as the caller id the service then records the call at the telephony level and sends very high quality recording straight to your email box think that even if you get it to install it will only work properly if you are currently in the us or canada as it seems to work by redirecting your call through landline call forwarding service which either wont work in other countries or will be using hideously expensive international rate call for that purpose
20978 the new phone app in ics does have contacts tab of its own it seems to show only the contacts with numbers so you might prefer to use that on most occasions
21020 full discharges put strain on the battery this topic might be of some help to you the first answer specifically
21021 modern phones use li ion and li poly batteries so the battery life is not affected by whether you charge them at or it only has long term effect batteries degrade with every charge cycle cycle is usually recharge from below so charging while the battery capacity is still relatively high has long term effect of less degradation the other frequent pseudoscientific habit that has no roots is technique many call formatting where you leave your battery plugged in for hours or hours with discharge in between or any other baseless claim by anyone on any forum or phone shop if they dont have scientific evidence dont believe them
21113 there are two places you should look for the external memory sd card or directory that is used for similar purpose and the internal memory the data data directory you may need to be rooted to access the latter in the best case scenario the game saves all your progresses in the cloud then you just need to reenter your login and its all restored this is typically only the case for online games some games may provide menu to export the save data or an external app to do so if they exist then you should preferably use them
21146 have no idea if theres some kind of separate minimum spec for this but the oem charger is 2a so times the usb2 specs 500ma
21150 doubt theres an answer to this beyond because thats how google designed its apps android itself does not require google account to use only googles proprietary applications do cyanogenmod and other pure source builds of android are actually forbidden from distributing the google apps within the firmware package itself because of their proprietary nature and if you install such rom without the associated google apps add on you wont even have the ability to add google account in your settings if you dont want to be tied to google then dont use the apps they produce but also dont be surprised that they want you to sign in when using services that they provide its really not that different from any other app or website that requires sign in to use the services it provides in my opinion but if you dont like it use different apps re the question about why maps specifically requires sign in on android but not ios the comments about the ios one being developed by apple could certainly be correct and do agree with those statements in addition apple may not want you to sign in googles servers with their maps app it would create tie however loose it may be between you and googles services which im sure apple is trying to discourage as much as possible to prevent customers from jumping ship to android another angle you have to keep in mind is that google is pushing pretty hard to tie together all of its online services as much as it possibly can based on their priorities and their business model it makes sense that the android version would try to integrate as tightly as possible with their other services and with the web its in their best interest from business perspective to try to make android apps and their web counterparts as seamless as possible in order to attract users to android who are already heavily invested in googles products of course this is just conjecture on my part think only google could truly say why maps works the way it does
21158 this turns out to be more complicated than just the amperage rating of the power adapter this xda post says that the tablet itself may step down to 5a charging if it cannot detect the right support in the usb host there are some additional details in this post but dont grok them that thread led me to this slashdot comment which seems very useful and knowledgeable if understand the story correctly unless the tablet can negotiate with the host device the amount of power it can draw is limited physical hack now part of usb standard in the adapter can make it clear to the usb client the tablet that there is no host device its wall wart so it can charge faster without the hack the device is limited in the amperage it can use more details on the usb charing spec are on wikipedia just verified some of this with my samsung galaxy tab and the no name 2a usb wall charger have if plug my tablet into this unapproved usb adapter then get little red on the battery charge indicator in the system tray additionally get the media scanner running alert which think means that the tablet thinks it might be connected to computer cannot tell at what rate 5ma 500ma 2a etc the tablet is actually charging at though if plug the tablet into the approved wall wart get no such red nor any media scanner alerts all that said in practice ive found that the tablet will charge up on my no name usb adapter im not sure if thats because tend to turn the screen off and dont have 3g and thus the power draw of the sleeping tablet is less than the 500ma or if its actually getting the full 2a think the upshot is that any reputable wall charger or anything labeled as compatible with an iphone or ipad will probably support the usb charging spec and thus will fast charge samsung galaxy tab but im just guessing it would be nice if there was an official usb logo or label for chargers that supported this mode
21160 you need google account only if you want to use google services if you dont want to use google services you are free not to have google account however it looks like you actually tried to use one of google services google maps and you were suprised that it requires google account by the way you can use the rest of android without google account since the operating system itself is free and open source
21173 its quite possible you accidentally shorted out circuit or otherwise damaged some part ribbon cable connector etc while disassembling or re assembling your phone the power supply line the tech fed you is probably just that something they said to avoid going into too much technical detail its unlikely that they will bother with figuring out which exact part is fried and will probably opt for replacing the phones whole main board instead be mindful of the price they quote you because these days you can get used nexus one for the price close to what some parts retailers charge for replacement motherboard
21178 power supply is actually term with some actual albeit generic significance and meaning in handsets the power supply is probablyim not an electrical engineer or expert on device hardware component that regulates the power supplied to the device keeping the voltage constant for one thing and manages the physical charging discharging of the battery as far as what could have damaged it it could be anything from dropping shaking the device if there is loose connection to short caused by water to overheating unless you can find connection that got loose and the power supply is indeed fried youll need to get it repaired if you think there might have been any water damage put the phone in rice for day or three it will dry out most liquid that may be in the device and it might just work
21200 since you asked this question google has added pre cache map area feature to google mapss experimental labs features you first have to go into settings labs and enable pre cache map area then visit place page either by clicking on poi or long pressing somewhere on the map look at the list of more options and click pre cache map area it will cache the area within miles of the point and keep it cached for days depending on the size of your city you might have to cache few different points to get the coverage you want heres more from the google blog http googleblog blogspot com download map area added to labs in html
21297 on my phone the credentials are stored in data wifi bcm supp conf youll probably need root to see it directly on your phone but you may be able to use adb pull requires the android sdk from your pc to get the file as noted in the comments the location may vary based on your rom or device specifically the wi fi chip mines broadcom check data wifi data etc wifi and data misc wifi for relevant config files if you dont find the ones suggested by eldarerathis or me
21299 on cyanogenmod devices and possibly other aosp roms you should be able to grab it from the data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf file on non rooted device dont think this is possible since you wont have permission to read the data directories where the settings are stored and the settings menu simply displays unchanged if you go into the network configuration this is what see on my cm7 evo network name and password redacted cd data misc wifi ls sockets wpa supplicant conf more wpa supplicant conf ctrl interface eth0 update config network ssid somewifinetwork psk myplaintextpassword key mgmt wpa psk priority
21318 technically they can inspect the http headers and look at the user agent field to determine browser and os but imagine the millions and millions of http requests for web pages and applications in given day they can do trends and data mining techniques to find out but is it worth all that effort for them just to track down someone using few more mb of bandwidth probably not
21355 eldarerathis may be right from his comment the tethering app itself might be monitoring your usage with statistics being sent to the service provider try using different tethering app if that might help but again say it might not make difference whether the device is rooted or not
21373 the following terminal command should enable bluetooth via adb shell or terminal emulator app su am start android bluetooth adapter action request enable on most versions of android this command will present pop up window to the user asking to confirm request to enable bt believe this was done for security purposes whenever an app that is not system is toggling bt havent found way to disable bt via shell command unfortunately with wifi its lot easier and does not prompt user for permission su svc wifi enable will turn it on and su svc wifi disable will turn it off

21451 think youre better off using titanium backup if you want to ensure that when you restore your phone youll have exactly what you had when you performed the backup find that androids new built in backup options are inconsistent for example after re installing some apps some of the settings are magically maintained however some data usually authentication data is no longer there guess this is good thing as storing everything in the cloud would be bit scary but when you use titanium there are no surprises all of the data is restored another benefit of titanium is that you can do multiple backups at of single apps data and restore any of those levels not so for the built in backup options so id advise using titanium
21461 from this xda thread by albundy2010 have seen quite of few people screw up their devices by not knowing what they are doing so am making this thread to simply tell people not familiar with fastboot what they should and should not do fastboot oem unlock will unlock your bootloader and do complete wipe of your device as far as know the only way for something to go wrong here is if youre device is low on battery and shuts off during the process either plug it in or have good amount of juice left in your battery to be percent sure plug it in before get into oem lock imho you should only use this command for one thing only getting the device ready to send into motorola for the lgt upgrade or another warranty repair or some sort when done properly it is completely safe but there is no reason to do to go back to stock fastboot oem lock do not issue this command unless you are absolutely sure you have the correct software on your device the correct software is what you get from the motodev site for your device you need the official sofware images for your specific device and region if it is not released then do not re lock the device if you have ota installed you will need to flash back to the motodev images first
21477 simply put fastboot oem lock puts your bootloader into mode that prevents you from overwriting your recovery image without subsequent fastboot oem unlock this serves as security precaution primarily where the default recovery and firmware is installed because the default recovery will only allow manufacturer google signed firmware to be installed and doesnt allow you to do much of anything else unlocking the bootloader will erase all data you can rest assured that under this configuration no one can take your phone and say bypass screen lock by installing custom firmware where the security considerations are different note that as this merely locks in your recovery and then again only from bootloader overwrites this is most useful where the recovery is stock and the installed rom is an official one that has no security vulnerabilities this is important because in most recoveries and in some roms there are ways to clandestinely access data via usb bypass security settings with fixed button presses or unpatched backdoors or install custom recoveries
21496 install smart app protector with its helper app for enhanced reliability make sure to make it device administrator then lock package installer and play store using it lock down other market apps too with one tap the app can lock all apps which could uninstall it the app facilitates this for its own security but its solution of your question and can bet after that your kids cant uninstall an app without developer level expertise update after your comment looks like your app launcher is capable of uninstalling apps directly like play store so lock your launcher too from your screenshot its samsung touchwhiz launcher having package name tw launcher lock this package with smart app protector but itd lock your app drawer too if you dont want to lock your app drawer best way is to switch your home launcher app lock package installer play store etc done alternate launcher apps have more features as well as memory efficiency so its better in all other aspects if you dont want to spend money id recommend you go launcher ex if you can spend money for this id recommend you adw launcher ex
21544 no dont think its controllable at least havent found any set of advanced settings in google play to enable disable such notifications so think at the moment you have to live with it though request can be made to google for improvements at http code google com android
21567 it means that in all probability it wont work there are lot of factors at play but if it installs correctly theres good chance it wont boot problems that could occur include your hardware will likely not have proper drivers if it shares drivers with other devices then it may work but otherwise various parts of the hardware will simply fail to function the partition layout may be different which could cause the install itself to fail if partition sizes are very different the kernel from another device may not run on your devices processor the boot image may not be configured and packaged properly for your device if the above all manage to be identical then the system may boot and function but its generally pretty unlikely

21799 security and performance implications the application resources stored on external storage are read only and hence there are no performance issues with loading or launching applications on sd card from http android developers blogspot co uk apps on sd card details html the post is written by suchi amalapurapu an engineer who worked on this feature the feature being the ability to put apps onto the sd card
21801 after posting the question here contacted all the different developers of google reader apps on the android market that could find so far only one developer has answered whose app does exactly what im looking for but is good enough https play google com store apps detailsid com droidlab7 reader pro ive tried it out on gawker media rss feed deadspin and cbc sports news works perfectly and fetches the full article no more annoying browser pop up in the top right corner theres button that executes the mobilizing functionality which is the scrape that was looking for if when hear back from other developers ill post it up more links
21804 one way is to open rom manager and choose flash clockworkmod recovery select your device when it prompts and wait for it to download the latest non touch recovery using file browser go to sdcard clockworkmod download site recoveries and paste your img there site may be mirror kanged net or something else just check the folders till you find an img file with the current date rename the existing img to something else and rename yours to the exact same name as the existing file was named for example rename recovery clockwork evo img to bak img and then name your file recovery clockwork evo img then return to rom manager and flash the recovery normally another method is to use fastboot from your pc put your device into fastboot mode and then fastboot flash recovery path to your recovery img another is to use terminal on your device data data com koushikdutta rommanager files flash image path to your recovery img you can move flash image somewhere more manageable first just make sure it has execute permissions
21805 if you have fastboot enabled bootloader version such as the old engineering hboot in the evos case you can use that to flash it from pc via usb reboot into your bootloader then select the fastboot option from the boot menu if it has one it may start up fastboot automatically once its ready go to your pcs shell and execute fastboot flash recovery path to recovery img you should also be able to use the flash image binary if your rom has it or you install it from xda copy the recovery img over to your device somewhere then do the following adb shell su flash image recovery path to recovery img

21912 ill expand idea of ryan conrad adb from android tools is the way prefer to follow this guide to install eclipse with android sdk http developer android com sdk installing html installation depends only on jdk no installing of new packages personally do the same few steps extracting two folders anywhere and configuring eclipse in the same manner on ubuntu mint or debian distributions and all is just working after completing this classical guide have two new folders eclipse and android sdks in the android sdks folder platform tools adb is the path to adb tool which can be used to push upload and pull get files from android device without mtpfs or additional mounts as adb is command line program it can be automated in jiffy moreover you have eclipses file explorer view which provides nice graphical tree filestructure and basic drag and drop interface do not forget to select your device in the devices view first the big shortcoming of this method is that only adb tool sees the device and can access it the rest of my system including nautilus for example still not sees the device but after getting used to stability and robustness of adb thats not the issue for me
21944 tasker will do this for you it allows you to automate tasks when certain conditions are met and is truly awesome app tasker works by monitoring contexts and then performing tasks when those contexts match the conditions you set contexts and tasks are grouped together to create profiles you can set up tasker profile with the calendar event context set to whatever conditions meet your needs from my google calendar calendar when event shows me as busy and or with title title and task containing silent mode on you can find more information about tasker from the tasker homepage and from the tasker wiki
21973 you can use an alternative launcher like launcher pro adw go launcher etc all of these have options for hiding apps from the app drawer unfortunately the gallery app will still appear in share and send to menus in various apps no way around that if you would rather certain folders remain invisible to the gallery app place blank file named nomedia in the folder to keep it from being displayed in the gallery unsure if quickpic will also have same functionality
21977 stock gallery is system app which cant be disabled if you are not rooted titanium backup pro can freeze it but only if it gets root access rooting will violate your warranty but you can always get your warranty back after un rooting device theres no way for anyone to catch you after that in case you are unable to find an un rooting method you can flash original firmware its the ultimate solution so you can go ahead to root your device
22064 yes it is standard behavior in ics this appears if you have more than one keyboard selected in the ics keyboard language settings page which is always the case if you use third party keyboard some custom roms particularly cm9 and aokp allow you to disable it in their extra settings
22149 yes you are subject to the same risks as you would have in laptop or any device that connects to wireless network for that matter to avoid them the standard security procedures apply do not use unencrypted connections that you do not trust and always prefer https for browsing
22224 try directly this if link is originated from an app for android to handle market detailsid package name note theres no domain and host
22228 good answer but this was still confusing to me because it wouldnt let me enter the app specific password for googles play store final solution create an app specific password for google play at https accounts google com issuedauthsubtokens name it android phone play store on the phone add 2nd google account all settings accounts sync launch googles play store go to menu accounts switch account then switch back when it asks for password enter the app specific password youve created
22283 yes at least stock image on my galaxy nexus does though if more than it just displays same as inbox
22299 my galaxy nexus with stock ics does show unread counts on my labels like this when click the labels icon at the bottom of the screen possibly more important than the version of android youre running is the version of gmail that youre runnning the gmail app was last updated on 4th april im running v4 which im pretty sure is the latest version check which version you have by going into settings applications and finding gmail in the list visit the gmail page in the play store on your phone to update if not

22386 its not quite as seamless but the ssh binary provided by busybox mine at least supports the flag so you can put the key wherever you want and use that ssh path to key file joeuser somehost com the relevant man page entry for with the caveat that the information about the default path may not be the same on android identity file selects file from which the identity private key for public key authentication is read the default is ssh identity for protocol version and ssh id dsa ssh id ecdsa and ssh id rsa for protocol version identity files may also be specified on per host basis in the configuration file it is possible to have multiple options and multiple identities specified in configuration files ssh will also try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by appending cert pub to identity filenames
22591 you can still use all the functions of the phone except carrier based calling of course without carrier contract however the cell radio will eat up battery hugely to turn off the radio dial scroll down and click the turn off radio button bluetooth and wifi will still function normally if your phone is rooted you can actually turn the radio off by setting script to run that will automatically turn off the radio at boot time create script as text file at the root of your sd card containing this text system bin sh system bin radiooptions radiooptions install script manager app open script manager and then select the script you created check the run as root option and the run at boot checkboxes click the save button and then click run to test do exactly this with my old og droid myself and use it as dashboard cam when im driving to record in case im in an accident
22677 as discovered here htc have removed the link to the training option in the settings menu however the actual feature remains intact so have created quick app to access it please note that we dont know why htc took it out they may have had very good reason and could be meddling however have used the training feature successfully on my sensation without any negative effects and the recognition is much improved ive put the application on google code the download link being here including cr code for devices please note that all use is under the mit license hope this helps others with the same problem also the option seems to have been returned to its normal position in the menu in the following android htc versions android htc sense software number viewable in settings about phone software information
22720 usually if you long press on the downloading item in download manager theres an option to delete it thus stopping the download if this doesnt work you can clear the download managers data settings apps all tab download manager here press force stop than clear data now reboot
22751 as your original question still isnt answered and wondered the same heres the answer short answer no without root its not possible to run an smb server using the default ports so that its found by windows pcs long answer smb either runs on ports udp and tcp using netbios or on newer systems from windows vista onwards directly on tcp port where in the latter case computer names are resolved by the llmnr link local multicast name resolution protocol which runs on udp port why is this important apps not running as root cant bind to unprivileged ports its possible to use alternative ports for smb but windows is hard wired to just listen to the default ones so guess if you use linux or separate smb client for windows which allows to connect to server with custom port number its probably possible but its not really straight forward way
22885 what the apk and exploit do usually is as follows the apk puts the right files in the right place to run the exploit the apk runs the exploit the exploit attempts to attain root access if it succeeds the exploit remounts system as read write and runs the installer script the installer script attempts to install the su binary and superuser apk and reboots as an example this page details how the rageagainstthecage exploit attempts to gain elevated privileges
22927 after much digging finally figured it out was wrong about where the magic is it is not in the installer script all that has to do is put the su and superuser apk binaries in the right place and set their permissions so it really is as simple as dropping files in place and setting permissions no magic wiring the magic happens in the su binary see the source and also this question was incorrectly thinking that su was standard su and that things were somehow wired up to moderate access to that binary through superuser apk wrong what actually happens is far simpler superuser provides custom implementation of su that authenticates access through superuser and its authorized application database so the process of rooting is as simple as sparx said the deployed software contains the magic
23000 no it isnt at least if you have to ask about it replacing any chip would require several thousand dollars worth of equipment and experience not to mention obtaining the correct replacement
23016 you cant most smart phones are designed as system on chip which means that the cpu ram gpu device controllers etc are all in single chip updating ram in such system means replacing whole lot of other stuffs not to mention that you probably would have hard time finding chip with different specification which fits perfectly into the hole that was left behind after you dismounted the chip due to size restrictions the components around the chip are designed to fit tightly into the available space
23017 im typing this response using bluetooth keyboard bluetooth mouse and external monitor hooked up to my samsung galaxy nexus it works great and was very simple to set up no special drivers or apps needed im using dell s2409wb monitor an old rocketfish keyboard and an old rocketfish mouse

23211 it greatly depends on what conditions made your phone to freeze but generally long press sec on the power button might get your phone to reset itself ymmv though
23212 htcs solution to this issue is to press and hold the power button for at least seconds and then release it htc one will be shutdown and then boot again this is the only solution would be able to see if you require something more then as phone modder would recommend you take apart the phone and manually disconnect the battery this is rather risky unless you are confident in what you are doing you may be able to refer to this page http htcpedia com news htc one how to take it apart html for tutorial on how to disassemble the unibody of the htc one the last safe option you have is to simply wait day or so since it is stuck on until the battery drains completely from there of course charge it up again and continue with whatever software modding you were doing
23233 poor connection may mean that there is either weak signal from your wifi partner device there is much noise from other systems using the same frequency both mean that many data packets are lost and have to be retransmitted so your overall throughput goes down you can compare this with somebody is speaking not loud enough many people are speaking at the same time and it is difficult to understand one person in that noise if you have interference problems it might help to change the wifi channel frequency
23281 while k3b is right in what poor internet connection means thats not whats causing the error message to appear if you actually have connection issues you dont get an error message pretty counter intuitive it appears that since upgrading to ics people have problem with this theoretically there should be setting to switch this off under settings wi fi advanced avoid poor internet connection said theoretically because dont have it see if you do and if it solves the problem if you dont or it doesnt read on theres root only application on xda developers thats supposed to solve this if you dont have or dont want to root you have to wait for google to fix this
23358 the file is not encrypted unless your specify so when creating the backup it is however compressed using deflate you can find out the exact format by looking at android source com android server backupmanagerservice java code and technically should be able to extract specific data from it however iirc there are some file integrity checks in place so it most probably wont work if you just delete bunch of data from it unfortunately the restore command doesnt seem to have an option to restore particular app package only or exclude package
23584 the only way rooting can gain you battery time is if you can uninstall an app thats using lot of power and which you cant uninstall without rooting its something that shipped with the device dont know what is on your device but judging from what ive seen on my droid theres not likely to be any noticeable change in battery life on the plus side if you root the device youll have the option to get rid of any junk that was pre installed and thereby not have to see all the update notices for stuff that youll never use and which wants more and more permissions with every update
23585 if you choose to root your phone there are several options as far as installing custom roms and or custom kernels some of these allow you change the clock speed of your processor the governor controlling the processor and so on which can all positively or negatively affect battery life if you are already rooted rom toolbox gives some nice options as far as system manipulation that can help with battery life juice defender ultimate also has some pretty cool options if youre root
23587 you can try dialing and then going to phone information that will show details about the network like cell tower id and network type as you can see from the below screenshot it shows edge mode also this may only work on stock android builds

23625 on my galaxy nexus it can found under settings developer options stay awake ymmv
23626 have checked on my two ice cream sandwich devices stock xoom and droid running cm9 beta have under settings developer options stay awake option which keeps your device awake when charging this will work if your device charges over usb my xoom does not for instance however should this option not be there we can turn to apps for help stayawake looks like it could be solution to your problem wakelocker for galaxy also looks to be solution
23633 the samsung galaxy ii does not have this feature and never has because of its amoled screen they burn like crts if they have the same picture on the screen for too long for some reason apps can still lock the screen on but you cant do it from settings my samsung galaxy ii has burn in from the notification bar you can use stayawake just dont forget to turn it off
23645 assuming that you havent changed the default triggers for the app you can simply text your phone from another device with findme to get your phone to send you gps information about its location ringaloud to get your phone to send you gps information about its location and to ring out loud at full volume sourced from their instructions page
23654 based on avirks hint found way first press the code gsm example gsm900 idle rx pwr rx ual rx lev tx lev speech ver amr efr fr voc adaptiverate ts temp batt lna service available it is obvious that its using 900mhz band from the gsm900 umts wcdma example wcdma idle rx ch tx ch tx pwr edio rscp speechver amr efr fr rf sleep2 l1 pch sleep drx cycle psc temp batt lna service available umts can use two different physical layers low level radio umts fdd and umts tdd android just shows wcdma which think is the same as umts fdd but perhaps it can refer to both of them by looking up the channel number here you can tell the frequency bands and whether it is umts fdd or umts tdd in the above example it is using umts fdd the down link channel rx is in the 2100mhz band and the up link channel tx is in the 1900mhz band
23656 if gps accuracy is enough for you plan is just what you need you can remotely install it via the play store web interface and it activates automatically sending the phones coordinates to your primary google account however it cant play sounds on your device to help you narrow the location further

23879 on my encrypted nexus use temporary tmpfs mount on sdcard in cwm it has enough ram to hold the new rom in memory during the update download your rom to tmp update zip and boot into recovery then log in via adb shell on the host machine do me workstation tmp adb shell now on the device in adb shell mode mount tmpfs none sdcard the following command is not needed it only shows the newly created mount point df filesystem size used available use mounted on none 4m 4m sdcard exit now back on the host machine again me workstation tmp adb push update zip sdcard kb bytes in 097s then do the usual update steps install zip from sdcard edit starting with ics jelly bean theres the new adb sideload filename of update zip method it works with cwm from version onwards and you need the android sdk platform tools v16 or better if youre in cwm you can see new entry install zip from sideload if its supported the old method still works if sideload doesnt work you can still use the tmpfs method cwm expects data media as the location for the update zip now the mountpoint has however to be data so you have to do this now me workstation adb shell mount tmpfs none data mkdir data media go on with adb push update zip data media and then like above reason starting with ics the proposed partition layout has changed there should be no fat formatted sdcard partition any more but the external storage now resides within data data media to remain compatible fuse mount emulates the old fat properties access rights and such you can see this when theres fuse mount on storage sdcard0 it looks similar to this shell android mount grep fuse dev fuse storage sdcard0 fuse rwnosuidnodevrelatimeuser id 1023group id
23932 im not sure about stock ics but in cyanogenmod you can disable this notification by going to settings language input and de selecting the selector notification option just below the list of keyboards
23940 strictly speaking you dont have to use googles services if you dont want to newer android os versions and above if im not mistaken allow you to bypass the initial sign in with gmail google account you lose the synchronization with googles services but otherwise the phone will be functional you can then use other services amazon getjar slideme etc or simply side load apps directly to your device if you can get them from other sources
23941 yes there are different problems an attacker sniffing and or redirecting all traffic via arp spoofing two different android applications already do this banned from market of course please note that it might be illegal to install and test them in your country faceniff allows dont know if it still applies to snoop on logged in credentials and take over facebook accounts and similar droidsheep does effectively the same an attacker impersonating as the hotspot the more serious one suppose it allows to hijack your phone any time if you previously have connected to well known hot spot provider your android phone usually remembers known hotspots by the accesspoints essid alone its name and tries to reconnect to it any time it sees such an essid again for ease of use this allows an attacker to set up such well known essid and your phone will happily connect to it then because no arp spoofing will be involved you cannot detect this behaviour easily just try it yourself set up your phone as an unencrypted hotspot device using well known hotspot essid and see how many connections you get in no time its maybe not even illegal to use such an essid and noone is tricked into using your connection either
23942 paid apps are tied to an google account but this is because of the google framework and not because of android no one needs to remove drm from android because there is no drm within android only support for it if you install free as in beer apps everyone can use them there is only one imitative that goes one step further then being drm less android foss apps http droid org

24413 in fact the charging time depends on two points the output current of the adapter or the usb the output current of the pc is only 5a it may charge slowly than most of the ac adapters most of the ac adapters are 1a or more the input current and the charging convert rate of the phone different phones have different input current due to limited current protection for them for example the limites current for nokia is 5a the input current is only 5a even you use an ac adapter with 0a output beside the charging convert rate is also different according to the models

24438 even though this may not be the place to ask this question you deserve some help with this one the information below will help but there is now additional information on rice baths and using water vs alcohol to clean electronics please read more from ifixit for more detailed information dont attempt to apply any power separate the phone into as many parts as you can take the battery out back cover off without taking screws out cover the device fully with dry rice try three days this gives the water time to evaporate hopefully aided by the rice reassemble and try the device again if this doesnt work theres few more things to try but chances are youre out of luck if you wish to be extreme or have spilled corrosive material soda juice etc note have friend that has done this successfully several times and even though it sounds scary it has worked for many people first take out the battery second check to make sure you took out the battery next submerge the phone without the battery completely in deionized water distilled should be fine leave it there for hours alternatively washing the internals with or higher isopropyl alcohol will clean the device just as well and evaporate much quicker without the need for rice soak after waiting such time remove the phone scrub the board with alcohol to remove any corrosion still do not replace the battery and cover it completely in dry rice for three times or week to be safe the amount of time you had it in the water this process should clean the inside of your phone and hopefully remove any salinity and should not harm the phone as long as there is no power applied to the device the battery
24442 it sounds like youre screwed at this point however this is what you should do if you happen to drop an electronic device in salt water immediately remove all battery and power sources and do not reconnect them for several days and after following the steps below if the exposure is quite high ie submerged in salt water for several seconds then you will want to flush the device with distilled water or if possible disassemble and clean all electric surfaces with alcohol dry the device by surrounding it in dry rice for days and maybe put it near something with ambient heat only when confident the device is dry should you reapply power the hope here is that when it shorted out the first time it didnt damage anything attempting to apply the power while device is still wet will certainly cause damage salt water is known to cause damage and therefore it might be best to try to flush the salt out with distilled water or disassembly if possible water itself will not cause much damage unless electricity is applied during the process
24529 technically its not prerequisite but convenience you can download an update using your handset and store it locally on the sdcard then reboot manually into recovery or use rom manager to do all that in an app and enjoy backup restore and ota updating without the need for computer stock recoveries wont let you do all the fancy stuff that custom recovery lets you do among them are backup restore using adb in recovery mode flashing custom zips thats what youll need format individual partitions wipe individual parts dalvik cache cache some handset makers have their own means of low level access to flash fastboot then has not all needed commands built in htc google others fastboot samsung fastboot proprietary heimdall open source flash tool sony sonyericsson fastboot proprietary flashtool by androxyde
24532 install repligo pdf reader and switch to text reflow mode it has one of the best text reflow mode till date which displays images too but to read codes youll have to fight again another option use ezpdf reader lite or pro and use its text column locking feature in landscape orientation to kick out blank margins and use large device height as width of pdf find it useful on my inch screen even for the codes because it doesnt change formatting to reflow text but if your screen size is much smaller than my one itd be useless to you plus both pdf readers feature voice reading you can use that too
24538 stock recoveries usually check the update zip file being flashed for specific signature that is only known by devices manufacturer and or carrier you cannot therefore flash custom roms on stock recoveries hence the need for custom recovery which bypasses said check
24544 as last ditch effort you could try this use titanium backup to backup all your apps data reset the phone to factory defaults restore all apps and data except for activesync this will definitely fix your issues question is is it worth the effort
24565 theres an option to keep your screen lit while charging try settings developer options stay awake
24579 with tasker you can automate this to have different screen time out values depending whether or not your phone is connected to power source create new profile and name it screen timeout for context select state power power select any for source and press the ok button tap new task name it increase timeout and tap the ok button tap the button to add new action select display category and then display timeout action drag the sliders for secs mins or hours to your desired values for when the phone is connected to power source tap the ok button and then tap it again long press the increase timeout action and select add exit task option tap new task name it decrease timeout and tap the ok button tap the button to add new action select display category and then display timeout action drag the sliders for secs mins or hours to your desired values for when the phone is running on battery tap the ok button and then tap it again ensure the tasker is enabled by toggling it on switch at bottom right corner and then tap the ok button you should be all set if you want to get fancy you can add actions to both tasks to display toast messages
24618 unfortunately yes for now that is how google has created the maps application you cannot use maps or navigation without internet access there are other apps that exist though that allow you to download maps for use offline sygic and navfree for example both allow you to store maps on your device and then only require gps fix to give you turn by turn directions note you still need internet wifi or data network to download the maps the first time but after that youre free to shut data off
24707 is there way to get notification that im off the air dont think this is possible but there might be an app out there for it im not sure im fairly certain that its not native function in android though is there way to reconnect without rebooting the phone airplane mode on off seems to be the easiest route if that doesnt work you can try going into more on the settings menu and look for available networks manually maybe youll find that you find other networks just not your carrier and in that case its actually coverage problem or problem with their equipment since you can actually see networks just not the one you want to connect to is this something that happens to others or am just lucky connection drops to the network is very common but its usually different kinds of drops for different reasons if you have rooted your phone and youre running custom rom you might need to check out getril if youre running stock try factory reset reinstall of your device first or see if theres any updates available from samsung get drops at times on my galaxy nexus as well but only lose data connection still see my carriers name and can recieve sms phone calls this sounds completely different from your issue if you are actually losing contact with the gsm network completely id recommend that you check out if you can find other carriers networks or not mentioned above if you can find others you need to notify your carrier first of all if you cant its probably phone specific but even there your carrier samsung should be able to help you if you still have warranty and the device is not rooted
24757 rest assured that is not virus its warning dialog to make you aware that you may have the app install from outside of google play blocked it is normal to proceed to check and confirm it is indeed unblocked go into settings security device administration tap on unknown sources dialog box appears tap ok as thats standard disclaimer which is normal de facto thing for gb menu settings applications check unknown sources and again similar dialog appears as disclaimer tap ok to continue and back out of it
24759 more likely that the movie app just wants to get installed its not uncommon that 3rd party software is installed this way

24804 of course not the only way the would be affected is if they were still pending purchases have removed card previously and all my apps were still intact your purchases are linked to your account not to your cards however common sense still applies if you have in app subscriptions set up on the card that youve removed than the next charge will fail
24844 although there is not general solution for remotely launching apps here is solution that applies to your situation first install androidlost from the online google play store this is the app you can use to control wipe access info about your lost device yadayada give it little time to install to your device then install androidlost jumpstart from the online google play store as well this app will wake up the registration process on the androidlost app when ever phone call is made an sms received battery is low package is added removed or changed so you have to install an arbitrary app from the play store as well to activate the service but you can then go to androidlost com to access functions to control your lost device including ringing an alarm edit jumpstart wont help on device with android newer than as in the description you can read please note that google has changed the android api so this app only works on android version so not possible with phone with to register androidlost later without the physical possess of the phone
24925 showing the same amount of content on screen would make it prohibitively small in most cases you wouldnt be able to read it so putting that much content on the screen just doesnt make sense resolution determines how many pixels you can display but one pixel is not the same size on every screen making content usable and readable requires you to use up more pixels on smaller screen because they are more densely packed for good comparison open web page on galaxy nexus and zoom all the way out the same page viewed on or such monitor with similar resolution would be no problem but the text is nearly indecipherable on your phone from the standpoint of how is this accomplished technically it largely depends on how an app is written by default android will simply scale the interface on to the larger screen which may or may not cause more data to be visible consider scrolling list for example more items would be visible on larger screen thats the most basic scenario its also possible however for developer to define entirely different layouts based upon screen size or density therefore the layouts on device may be completely unrelated to the layouts on device or device this gives developers lot of flexibility to create richer uis for tablets and other such devices while keeping the phone uis useable this is covered in length on androids developers site
24927 thats because the pixels per inch ppi is different between them the higher the ppi the higher the quality but at cost of relative smaller screen size so the nexus has pixels per inch while the galaxy nexus has pixels per inch the resolution isnt everything you also have to consider the density of the pixels high ppi values have the advantage that its hd but it also has disadvantage which is smaller screen size at persistent resolution you can read more about ppi here
24984 this just happened to me as well had to change my account password via the website and then my device accepted the new password it only happened with the account use for google so think your guess is correct
25013 resolved this by signing out of google and then signing back in this worked on stock droid with gingerbread
25179 android anti theft security and androidlost both provide these functions along with many other security apps available for android there is also an app called sms alarm pager which sounds like exactly what you need but cannot tell as the description is in another language
25192 tasker can automate things like that and lot more it takes while to acquaint oneself with it and bucks to buy theres 7day trial available as well but its well worth the effort
25194 from the my htc evo 3d book touch to enable voice privacy which makes your evo 3d encrypt your phone calls what is voice privacy when you enable voice privacy your evo 3d starts encrypting your calls so nobody can eavesdrop on them by encrypting your phone calls between your evo 3d and the cell tower you add an extra layer of protection on your calls just in case someone wants to try to listen in for this feature to work your cellular service provider must support it otherwise enabling it on your evo 3d is useless
25195 voice privacy is something that is part of cdma found this article that talks little bit about it in the introduction voice privacy of is cdma is provided by means of the long code mask the long code mask is not transmitted through any channel it is constructedby the base station and the mobile station to recover the long code sequencethe eavesdropper may exhaustively search the bit long code mask with atime complexity of o2 this attack is viable but is hard to implement inreal time alternatively it can be shown that the long code sequence can also be recovered if the eavesdropper can obtain bits of plaintext ciphertext pairs as there are many mobile stations transmitting simultaneously on the tra cchannel and each mobile station only transmits approximately minutes onthe average it is rather di cult to obtain bits of the plaintext message have also found couple posts that talk about how sprint did studies that said it isnt really any more secure unless your eavesdropper has tons of money to spend on decrypting your call actually voice privacy on cdma is an added layer of voice encryption sprint did some independent research ive heard quotes as big as million dollars worth and determined that cdma without voice privacy is just as secure unless youve got million dollars worth of financing to break into an individual phone call in other words turn the feature off and dont worry about it
25196 this is feature of cdma standardized in is and is called voice privacy see an analysis of is cdma voice privacy by zhang et al from free download here citation the real paper begins at in the pdf abstract the voice privacy of is cdma cellular system is analyzed in this paper by exploiting information redundancy on the downlink traffic channel it is shown that an eavesdropper can recover the voice privacy mask after eavesdropping the transmission on the downlink traf fic channel for about one second thus is cdma voice privacy is vulnerable under ciphertext only attacks that cryptanalysis is now years old and already then was the scheme considered broken guess its easy to suggest to just leave the setting disabled by combining some information grepped from the android source im pretty sure its what youre asking for to make it little more transparent here are some source references packages apps phone res xml cdma call privacy xml defines xml version encoding utf preferencescreen xmlns android http schemas android com apk res android xmlns settings http schemas android com apk res com android phone android title string additional cdma call settings com android phone cdmavoiceprivacycheckboxpreference android key button voice privacy key android title string voice privacy android persistent false android summary string voice privacy summary preferencescreen packages apps phone res values strings xml defines those strings string name voice privacy voice privacy string string name voice privacy summary enable enhanced privacy mode string hardware ril include telephony ril defines also typedef struct ril callstate state char isvoice nonzero if this is is voice call char isvoiceprivacy nonzero if cdma voice privacy mode is active ril call
25205 vlc media player beta for android was just released today you can take look at it am not sure if it works fine on ace though
25214 think the problem might be with the phone the galaxy ace is at the lower end of the scale hardware wise so imagine it cant handle hd files
25219 hd player and real player sound promising to play mkv videos smoothly but if video quality is overloading your hardware capabilities no software can help playing that hd video smoothly however you can do one thing install hot reboot from play store and run it once before video playback itd reduce load on system if youre unable to play that video on your device id recommend you to use handbrake to rip that video for your device
25252 to understand why nexus can show more content than the galaxy nexus ill first explain two concepts screen density and density independent pixel but before we go into technical details it may be worth to clarify the design goals of using density independent pixels the goal is to define ui that is similar in dimension across devices regardless of the screen size so in this case the appearance of the menus is the same in the galaxy nexus and the tablet side by side should look very similar but as one has bigger screen more content can be shown the designer selects an appearance that looks good for certain size dpi screen is the base and this is simulated in this case in devices with higher dpi screen density commonly referred to as dpi dots per inch android groups all actual screen densities into four generalized densities low medium high and extra high device such as galaxy nexus has extra high screen density more specifically the dpi value is set at the nexus uses tvdpi dpi density independent pixel commonly referred to as dp this is the virtual pixel unit used when displaying content the density independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on dpi screen to calculate dp use the following formula px dp dpi or equivalently dp px dpi the reason nexus can show more content than the galaxy nexus despite having similar resolutions is this the dpi of nexus is lower than galaxy nexus galaxy nexus dpi pixels wide dp nexus dpi pixels wide dp this means that when apps are rendering on the galaxy nexus the width of the screen is actually dp rendered using pixels whereas on the nexus the width of the screen is dp rendered using pixels bonus if your galaxy nexus is rooted you can use an app such as lcd density modder and change the dpi of your device to what youll get is something lot closer to nexus in smaller package on the left is screenshot of the device at dpi youll notice we can see lot more content when the dpi is lower nothing to do with ppi the other answers mention ppi the amount of content displayed has nothing to do with the ppi of device though commonly vendors select the dpi that is closest to the ppi of the device galaxy nexus has ppi of but dpi of where as nexus has ppi of but uses dpi further reading http developer android com guide practices screens support html
25264 didnt find place in the stock system which tells this but there are useful tools around like appmonster which display this information along besides appmonster allows you to backup your apps and in the pro version even does so automatically on install as well as update so you can revert to previously installed version easily in case of trouble with an update
25282 titaniumbackup also displays this when you go to the batch backup restore tab you can have it sort your apps by date of installation name size and so on it should be noted that you need to root your phone to do so
25287 update may 3rd my previous answer was for much outdated platform latitude doesnt even exist anymore as far as can tell here are some steps for current google maps open the maps application navigate to settings there should be an option to edit home or work address previous answer below for historic purposes finally figured out how to do this and thought would explain since it is not very obvious open up google maps or latitude click on yourself the tag that shows your name last update time and city you should be able to click location history option with the history open click the settings button in the lower right corner there are options to change your home and work addresses hope this helps someone in the future
25336 had the same problem my solution was to uninstall and reinstall google and everything worked fine after that
25367 encountered exactly the same problem as yours on my galaxy s2 with cm9 earlier this week figured out it might be the problem that the internal usb storage had some error on it unfortunately formate dalvik cache and cache wont fix the problem you can try to mount your phone onto your computer and try to fix the error using some disk check utilities which tried but phone freezes after mount as usb at last fix the problem by doing hard reset so suggest you start from trying mount your phone to your computer and do some quick backup first if you cannot even copy out your files it is the problem of internal usb storage with some logical errors
25472 simple answer no android always uses oom out of memory prioritizing to free unused memory you can change the priorities of apps at least until reboot with some task managers but even then if the memory runs low apps in the background start getting killed think about this scenario youve downloaded badly coded app which runs on boot causes buffer overflow and hogs all your memory normally this app is killed but if its set to stay open it effectively bricks your phone until reboot and after that starts again and again etc some timers use services with high priorities to avoid this problem but if you launch enough high performance resource hogging apps while the timer is in the background it will eventually get killed
25482 the nfc circuitry itself is in the phone but the antenna is in the battery this is due to the layout of the phone since the range of nfc is very small the antenna is placed on the outer side of the battery to increase the range as much as possible yes the downside of this is that replacement batteries need to be nfc enabled but its small price to pay for significant improvement in the functionality of nfc
25485 the nfc feature does not sit in the battery only the antenna does nfc consists of an integrated chip soldered onto the logic board an nfc antenna that needs free view to the phones back side antenna signals from the sticker on the back of the battery only need to pass the back cover if you look at the antenna youll notice how big it is its basically just coil with windings see ifixits teardown nfc allows for passive devices credit cards and such which need to be fed energy from an active device through the antenna some engineer decided its best fit would be as sticker on the battery theres only positions where you can place it back of the battery inner side of the battery cover like with the nexus my guess is this by placing it on the battery the expensive and big point connector as with the nexus could be merged together with the battery contacts to make it cheaper and or maybe more robust
25533 have several bluetooth gps adapters that use with all of my devices when need superb signal because specialiced receiver is almost always superior to smartphones internal gps due to integration constraints see more generic question answer here what can do when my gps doesnt work or if my tablet doesnt have gps
25583 you can use bluetooth bluetooth ftp file transfer profile is supported by linux and theres the bluetooth file transfer app that adds this functionality to android its however not that fast 200kb depending on your bluetooth versions theres fuse module called obexfs heres my nexus mounted root local tmp obexfs f0 f1 xx xx xx media bla root local tmp cd media bla root leo61326 media bla ls lh media bla dcim total 55k drwxr xr root root 100andro drwxr xr root root rafting drwxr xr root root camera some file explorers support it via plugins directly nautilus gnome kde here are some ubuntu related obex questions
25625 its hsdpa which if im not mistaken is referring to 5g
25786 from your mentioning of titanium backup assume your device is rooted so my absolute recommendation here is autorun manager and yes you will need the pro second yes its worth it having that installed open the app use the advanced mode look for the app you want to modify in your case google maps expand it arm will show you all its listeners disable them thats it nothing is waking it up anymore unless you explicitly start it but before you start it you may need to enable those listeners again or you may experience strange side effects did on the other side at least this does not require reboot for technical details you might want to crosscheck with the question how can manage intent associations with apps or directly dive into the intents section of the aosp developer manuals
25845 google reader google reader is web based tool for gathering reading and sharing all the interesting blogs and websites you read on the web it was released by google on october and graduated from beta status on september is available on any modern web browser with javascript enabled for further information visit google support getting started with google reader wikipedia google reader google currents google currents is an app that delivers beautiful magazine like editions to your tablet and smartphone for high speed and offline reading it was released by google in december is currently available for android and ios devices for further information visit google currents webpage google play google currents page wikipedia google currents to answer your questions whats the difference between the two the major difference is that google currents is an app to be installed on your tablet or smartphone while the google reader is web based application is there any reason to use one over the other the major reason is that google current is currently available for tablet and smartphones while the google reader being web based application can be used on every device with an javascript ready web browser does currents replace reader havent found any indication that google currents came to replace google reader actually the opposite seems to be happening as the google currents can accept your feeds from your google reader account think of google currents as more flexible way of reading feeds without the need of web browser reader app vs currents app youve mentioned on the comment for this answer that theres currents app and reader app yes it does exists and didnt know about it just installed to compare the differences reader app continues to be plain old fashioned rss feed just with new face from differences between the mobile and standard web interface google support the mobile interface accesses the same subscriptions as the standard web interface and items read on your mobile device will be marked as read in the standard interface as well similarly items read on the web will be marked as read in the mobile interface the only difference is that you cant set up subscriptions from your mobile device currents app instead of adding direct rss feeds you can add featured sites from well over publishers that google has partnered with they include forbes techcrunch allthingsd the huffington post abc news al jazeera and the guardian you can choose sites from other featured topics including business design science tech sports and your rss feeds from your google reader account additionally you can be google producer and add your own content to google currents
25894 google reader is cloud based feed reader service on top of this service there are many apps as front end to user official google reader apps web android feedly firefox android etc google currents is front end digital magazine newspaper delivery app with cloud sync available to android and ios no web interface yet google currents can read feeds but it wasnt designed for that google has vision attached with it real digital magazine newspaper delivery which is beyond normal feed reading see the differences feed publishers dont have control of content display in end app but currents publishers do have they can divide their currents in sections sub sections they can decide the layout of this digital magazine etc its not just nice looking magazine interface its more than that feedly which sync with google reader also provides magazine interface but its not really magazine think about your real world magazine reading experience currents can be premium current publishers can charge you which is not possible with google reader while theres concept of premium feeds which is rare google reader can only subscribe it but google currents can be marketplace for that google currents cant replace google reader because its different thing if you dont have special interest in those hand created digital publications go for google reader you can use it on web windows mac ubuntu etc along with tablets and smartphones all in sync for read unread status starred items you can have thousands of interface choices thanks to google reader api and yes you can always mix feeds in google reader to create your own feed dj which is not possible with google currents
25903 opening adb on an unsecured connection is major security risk on an unrooted phone it gives access to your entire filesystem on rooted phone it gives access to your entire filesystem with write permissions the connection isnt encrypted and there is no password or key exchange to access adb its just bad idea beyond that your carrier may not even allow traffic over the standard adb port they may be proxying your traffic or there may be other complicating factors also setting up ssh shouldnt be difficult use sshdroid all the time can get secure shell from any wifi connection and it works great for wireless file transfer you could set up task to turn on sshdroid whenever the device connects to wifi and another to send you the ip technically you can even run it without wifi but generally wouldnt recommend it as its still open to vulnerabilities which would lead to problems similar to leaving adb open although somewhat less likely since ssh is designed to be secure finally there are number of apps that are built specifically for locating your phone motorola includes this feature with motoblur which can also wipe your phone remotely there are other free and paid alternatives that can do this as well if your phone is actually stolen these are going to be much better than any back door you open for yourself
25941 most likely because the ip address returned was only valid within the mobile network there is nat gateway even if you tried connecting from another device in the same network your carrier probably have some routing rules in place to prevent devices from communicating to each other directly it would be neat to have tasker profile or something where if my phone is ever stolen can text my phone making tasker enable adb listening and reply with whichever ip address my phone is connected to and perhaps turn off after seconds unsurprisingly that idea wasnt new there are many stolen lost phone app in the play market prey and plan lookout wheres my droid etc use those instead of trying to bend tasker for it
25986 please check our newly launched website called androiddrawer com its an android app apk repository basically if you dont like the app update you can revert to the previous version by downloading the previous one you can learn more about androiddrawer here you can view the site and download the apk on your mobile device
26002 at least in vanilla ics its in settings developer options stay awake correct me if its not there in gsiii if its not there you can try couple of apps that can do this at least on older galaxy series phones stayawake stay awake widget
26003 samsung removed stay awake from touchwiz back in the first ota for the galaxy s1 other roms like cyanogenmod still have it and other aosp based roms as well be very careful using any kind of stay awake options with these devices that have the super amoled screens used to use it when developing and testing the apps now have burn in the screen from the time and the top bar
26004 encountered the same issues sometimes and couldnt detect it without trying to make phone call then went into the parameters panel into the mobile network part there force the phone to select my operator and remove the auto detection option since this modification when im disconnected from gsm network have little warning sign grey triangle with white exclamation point inside in the notification toolbar to force reconnection go in the same menu and force the phone to search available networks select mine and it is almost every time reconnected
26013 edit new solution you can revert to your complete old behaviour it needs some hacking though and might be illegal decompile recompile google app background if you dont have root you cannot install the old version over the new one what you could do install an app with the functions of the old search app idea if the old app had different package name you could install it next to the new app how apktool solution proposal use apktool to decompile and change the whole namespace from com google android googlequicksearchbox to com google android googlequicksearchbox2 of working old apk see zip below mind the in the end then recompile and install the newly crafted package result old and new broken provider can be installed next to each other at the same time because they have different namespace searchbox2 instead of searchbox just find out which one is the old one and use that benefits no root required permanent cannot be taken away drawbacks you get 2x the same widget offering 1x from the old 1x from the new so you have to find out which works and which not my test so far apktool is an alias to java jar usr local bin apktool jar on my machine fyi apktool decompile googlequicksearchbox apk appdir append every occurrence of the namespace with find appdir type while read do sed suicksearchboxuicksearchbox2g done rename the directory to reflect that too mv appdir smali com google android googlequicksearchbox smali com google android googlequicksearchbox2 apktool build tmp bla apk appdir any sort of signing jarsigner signapk jar java jar tmp signapk jar tmp certificate pem tmp key pk8 tmp bla apk tmp gsearch2 apk adb install tmp gsearch2 apk edit old solution what would be nice to know does this only affect samsunng and googles us customers according to androidcentral samsung now deploys this update as stability fix globally its most probably this package that got updated com google android googlequicksearchbox located at system app googlequicksearchbox apk having root is definitely required to revert the situation id however decide to get rid of samsungs firmware altogether and install cyanogenmod for example this might even be easier than getting root in the first place on the orginal firmware you might want to reinstall the unaffected version from the last firmware or one of euro firmware if theyre not stripped for example this archive from the popular goo im hosting site will most probably have working older apk that has the functionality you miss its generic installation package for the popular cyanogenmod aftermarket firmware that holds all relevant proprietary packages from google they had to be stripped off cyanogenmod by googles request some time ago you can open it with any unzip program and extract the system app googlequicksearchbox apk package thats how would do it using the adb tool from the google sdk adb push googlequicksearchbox apk sdcard adb shell su mount remountrw system cp sdcard googlequicksearchbox apk system data mount remountro system reboot exit used application explorer to generate this listing and see where the apk is located app name google search package name com google android googlequicksearchbox source directory system app googlequicksearchbox apk you can get the version of google search by going to settings apps all google search which lists the current version mine the same as in the above mentioned zip is
26108 as of now the checking for ble support has to be done manually by studying specifications and searching on google as far as know see this question on stackoverflow bluetooth smart gatt support in android it states that android does not support bluetooth le out of the box up to android maybe with jelly bean onwards the nexus tab suggests that manufacturers have to add their own api to allow access to bt le this app is limited to motorola thats why your mileage may vary with different phones up to casios bluetooth le enabled watch is also an example of limited official compatibility not even the iphone 4s is mentioned by the way my best guess is that with more devices having the issue will solve by itself and you can find apps showing it here are lists by manufacturers motorola htc good listing not found yet google galaxy nexus not with nexus tab
26158 there used to be an app that did just this but its been pulled for some reason you could also download system info type app but these often come with ads and other bloatware the easiest way is to download terminal app such as android terminal emulator open it and run the command getprop ro product name and youll get the variant heres an example what the run looks like u0 a109 android export path data local bin path u0 a109 android getprop ro product name takju u0 a109 android and there you have it takju another way would be to open adb shell and running getprop ro product name from there this is more useful if you already have adb installed otherwise its faster to just download the app
26235 sounds like this is one of two things to me either faulty screen hardware or depending on the severity of this flicker it may be that the device has light sensor that is trying to change the screen brightness based on the ambient light surrounding the device you could rule out the second option by going to your screen brightness in the settings and make sure that it is set to static amount and that automatic brightness is turned off if after you do this you still notice the flickers would lean more towards faulty hardware have seen on some devices dont have nexus so never on that that the automatic brightness feature will sometimes cause the brightness of the screen to flicker somewhat wildly from all the way low to all the way high within few seconds
26397 recall seeing post on rootzwiki where someone was seeing very similar issue though on galaxy nexus specifically he had the following symptoms to my dismay found that get an error no matter what try to buy free apps seem to work fine the solution he ultimately ended up finding was got it found tweet from peter alfonso stating to uninstall the market updates and clear cache to do this go into settings apps swipe left to the all tab then select the play store it should be titled google play store so look in the area and press uninstall updates once thats finished hit clear cache or clear data if you want to wipe all of its data completely once youve done that relaunch the play store and try to purchase the app again
26398 in order of least to most destructive clear data on market app reboot remove your google account reboot add it again clear data from google framework services this is similar to above in that it will log you out but im not sure what else this clears reboot sign back in the 3rd one was what finally fixed it for me and havent had the issue again
26417 according to this thread on code google com from april it seems that one user solved similar issue after they were advised to turn off step auth to use google play im having same issue tech just advised have to turn off step verification to get into play so would disable step auth on the google account associated with the device and try again if that doesnt work wonder if its even worth trying factory reset with step auth turned off btw that thread is in the issues list for source code behind the google authenticator application the issue is not actually related to that application however after setting up step auth the user reportedly could not access google play so that is why they blamed that app alternatively still assuming step auth is part of the issue you could create an app specific password for google play as described in this answer quoting that answer create an app specific password for google play at https accounts google com issuedauthsubtokens name it android phone play store on the phone add 2nd google account all settings accounts sync launch googles play store go to menu accounts switch account then switch back when it asks for password enter the app specific password youve created
26457 the main difference that can see is the type of accounts that are supported the gmail app is limited to accounts from google username gmail com read and respond to your conversations online offline manage multiple accounts view and save attachments set up label notifications email app username your domain com the main feature is that it works with all email providers but its very basic app you can send and receive emails but no search capabilities present
26458 the gmail application speaks gmails own proprietary protocol back to the gmail server whereas the email application speaks open protocols such as pop3 or imap as well as supporting activesync the email application also has somewhat better support for multiple accounts if you are only using single gmail account then it is better to use the gmail application but if youre using multiple accounts or non gmail accounts youll want to use email personally use gmail for my gmail account which only use for google specific purposes and email for my imap
26506 there just was blog on land of droid covering this issue the author summed up few conditions under which this flicker occurs back light is dimmed under weak wifi signal the device is accessing the net according to that report these things are and connected the flicker occurs when all of the conditions are met hes also hoping for fix to come soon you might as well want to read the comments there some seem to indicate possible solutions including flashing new stock rom but so far none of them are yet confirmed
26546 do not have mapping between characters and images but was able to figure out where the images are stored and its contents the images are stored in system framework framework res apk having pulled this file from ics emulator extracted and found files for emoticons grouped based on dpi the following are the files and its preview for ldpi and the hdpi could not find the map between the string that we type and its corresponding image there are many google search results that will help to replace these image files and add some more stuff as well the added emoticons will make sense only if both sender and receiver has this modification else it will be seen just as text only know this does not answer your question but while trying to find out one stumbled on this information which could be useful for some one or some one knowledgeable enough can take it from here mapping roxan shows us that androids default keyboard has emotions when you long press the key lets see if we can figure out how the map to the symbols emo im happy emo im sad emo im laughing emo im cyring emo im undecided emo im embarrassed emo im angel emo im foot in mouth emo im money mouth emo im cool emo im kissing emo im yelling emo im suprised emo im toungue sticking out emo im winking emo im lips are sealed emo im wtf you can edit the answer if you found an error or new mapping
26556 this is feature in ics and above its goal is to make it easy to switch input methods it only appears if you have more than one ime enabled the sad thing is that if you use non stock keyboard this will always appear if you want to get rid of it simply go into settings apps all tab and find the default keyboards open the entry and choose disable
26615 you can solve this issue either from the android side or from the windows side from the android side tap your device menu button and select settings tap wireless networks tap wi fi settings tap your device menu to bring up extra options and select advanced tap use static ip fill in your local network static ip details and dns server details tap your device menu to bring up extra options and select save from the windows side open the dns management add new forward lookup zone for the google dns and set host record to your local ip
26699 this is really continuation of zuuls answer to cover the dns settings in android ics which is little harder to find imo afaik zuuls answer covers android settings from the android side android ics settings wifi click on word wifi not on off switch press and hold long tap your wireless network until dialog pops up select modify network check show advanced options checkbox at the bottom switch ip settings to static fill in your local network static ip details and dns server details tap save whoever made long taps standard interface feature is dummy
26736 have look at 3g watchdog you can add homescreen widget and even disable 3g once you get to predefined limit
26739 mentioned 3g watchdog probably is the best choice alternatively you might want to take look at netcounter traffic counter extended mobile counter net traffic counter which also cover your needs might be you like one of them more talking about more obviously missed traffic monitor traffic monitor same name other app this one goes as deep as on per app stats
26811 three methods available depending from where are you accessing google google play app usually uses the language defined on your device settings tap your device home tap settings locate language keyboard and tap under select language you can define the language for your device that is also used by the google play app as to present you the information on your language accessing from browser the google play store sets the language by your ip address you can update that definition by changing it at the footer it will persist for all google products from gmail you can access your account settings and set the language that you prefer for google products login to your gmail account on the top right corner click account on the left vertical menu click language
26889 first off talk to your exchange administrators see if they deliberately are setting the mobile device security settings so tightly would have discussion with them to see if they can loosen up the security settings if you only want email you could try from the app store it uses imap to get the mail from the server so your exchange server will have to have that turned on
26890 here it is the modified email apk this is for ice cream sandwich only this tool bypasses security restrictions the client claims it will enforce the hard reset policies but it wont in fact please use it with extreme caution there is specific reason why an administrator configures such policy and would recommend it to everyone if your phone gets stolen nobody will be able to read your companys email which is secret lots of industrial accidents occurred because employees lost their mobile devices laptops included with sensitive data not protected enough if you fear that misconfiguration will someday format your device backup is your best option
26907 co worker said he found work around with this app moxier mail im using the trial right now and like it lot really like that it lets me separate my work from the rest of my tablet it also doesnt fall under the security requirements it does require pin for the app itself and there are useful widgets all in all it seems even better than the built in mail app the full versions expensive but my co worker says its worth it

27130 here are some key points to this problem though not all of them applied in this case will still include all of them as in another case they might prove helpful good starting point to check is apps manage apps in androids system menu which lists all apps data and can be sorted by size to identify the biggest consumers while here you can delete too big caches per app some directories in the file system cannot be investigated without having root privileges so the preferred du sort to find the biggest files would skip directories below data still having terminal emulator available android terminal emulator would be good candidate at least df could show where free space goes toward zero see screenshot below in case the parameter human readable is not understood on your system you might try to replace it by megabytes kilobytes or omit it completely the article debugging android core dumps describes core dumps under android are called tombstones and stored globally as data tombstones tombstone nn with nn simply being counter as many crashes were reported this might be place filling up see below but only 5mb could be located here in this case according to android forensics by andrew hoog it might be worth diving into data local the data local directory is important as it allows shell the user account nonrooted phones run adbd as read write access when an app is installed it is first copied to data local which means even on non rooted devices one should be able to dig in here sd maid system cleaning tool might find some more orphans but without root access this apps capabilities are limited if the big egg cannot be found and removed one can either start to uninstall some apps cleaning big data from others see first step or as last resort there always remains the factory reset which should clean up everything but be aware all your downloaded apps and all your data on internal storage only of course sd card will not be affected will get removed as well when you do this if still unable to solve the issue last resort is factory reset but before doing that it would be good to be prepared for the next time so one last chance are few steps immediately before the factory reset backup as much data apps as you need and can switch to airplane mode the market must not know what we are doing now one by one uninstall your apps for system apps which cannot be uninstalled uninstall their updates clear cache and data after each uninstall check your free space for unexpected big jumps if such jump happens note the app uninstalled at this place it has to be the evil one continue if it still doesnt make up for the missing space when finished with the last one go to the point of no return pull the plug do the factory reset its over now after the reboot re configure your virgin device with your original market account data you remember them hopefully as we made sure the market stood uninformed of our actions from step on you should now be able to re sync your apps and some data the apps for sure the data only provided you synced them with the market before step keep an eye on the evil apps if you detected any at step you may want to remove these now or later the following screenshot shows the output of df on motorola droid as you can see there are mount points on internal storage which could be candidates for getting filled data the most likely and got the hit in this case plus cache the command was executed without root privileges tombstones the folders location is data tombstones permissions of the data directory are drwxrwxr the tombstones subdirectory has drwxr xr so they are accessible also on non rooted devices using terminal emulator see above you can cd data tombstones and do ls to see whether there are any tombstones and what size they occupy unfortunately all tombstones are owned by system and permissions are set to rwx so if thats your troublemaker you cannot remove them without root have good backup huh how without root and probably factory reset will be your last resort
27168 not with the regular playstore app afaik if you want to do so using an app you might want to take look at market comments reader from within the web browser androidpit allows to show comments of all languages at once without selecting each language separately update note that both the app and the androidpit site section are dead by now for work around you could use my userscript googleplayswitchlang in web browser like firefox via an addon like greasemonkey see the greasyfor main page for list of options for your favorite browser the script injects links to easily toggle between languages currently german and english but you easily can adjust it to any language combination you need

27233 cache partition is mostly for saving the downloads from google play store found in cache downloads it also can hold the recovery log found in cache recovery called last log as well this holds any errors and or diagnostics from the recovery binary cwm or stock which will get logged in the file to aid debugging and development of the recovery binary there is also another directory in there called lost found which holds any recovered files if any as result of file system corruption such as incorrectly removing the sdcard without un mounting it so really there is no loss of data from clearing it in fact upon android boot up the script will clear out the cache downloads to make way for any new downloads updates from google play store
27238 to give closer overview on filesystems used on android devices heres short table with selection of the more important ones mount point file system type what to find here proc proc metadata about the system such as file system statistics data data yaffs2 almost all app data data ext3 ext4 yaffs2 data from apps except those stored on data data plus system cache yaffs2 ext3 cache file system used by some apps and by the system mnt asec tmpfs unencrypted apk file the encrypted counterpart is stored in mnt sdcard android secure decrypted variant is needed for running systems to access execute app cache tmpfs temporary file system used by the stock browser on some htc devices mnt sdcard vfat fat32 file system on the sd card mnt emmc vfat fat32 file system on the embedded internal emmc on older systems entire data is just single partition file system on newer devices data can be further segemented you will not find all these file systems on all devices but if you find some of them this list should give you raw idea
27280 connector seems fl smt and probably is for an external additional antenna fl is miniature coaxial rf connector for high frequency signals up to ghz manufactured by hirose electric group in japan fl connectors are commonly used inside laptops and embedded systems to connect the wi fi antenna to mini pci card female fl connectors are not designed with reconnection in mind and they are only rated for few reconnects before replacement is needed the female fl connectors are generally not sold separately but rather as part of pigtail with high quality mm doubly shielded cable which allows for low loss connection from wikipedia
27348 as axeman said the connector is an ultra small surface mount coaxial connector quite mouthful and still could not get how it was abbreviated as fl which is kind of expansion port which could be used for any radio communication including gsm wifi gps and as lie ryan said the fourth terminal in the battery is for connecting the antennae in the battery to nfc circuitry on the motherboard few searches in google confirmed this and gives raise to following information those who have nfc in their phones may lose the nfc capabilities if they try to replace with cheap and duplicate batteries which may not have the nfc antennae as said here am summing up all the points to make this question as answered was unable to accept axemans answer as complete as it did not answer the nfc part and lie ryan had added as comment only kudos for them both update happen to get hold of lg p500s service manual which confirms the rf connector with the following image tagged as sw1001
27397 well drivers and the kernel are not exactly the same drivers are what control the cell antenna wifi bluetooth etc these are proprietary drivers because the manufacturer has to create way the drivers to talk to their hardware the kernel is an intermediary level between the os application and the actual drivers or cpu or memory or any other hardware it is what allows your os apps to interface with these hardware components all of the millions of kernels you see are really not that much different from each other typically programmer modder will take the existing kernel and tweak it to try and get difference performance out of it you can essentially say that they are only adjusting for the most part the configuration of the kernel in the android world these modders are primarily looking at over or underclocking the cpu clock important for either saving battery life or trying to run most process intensive applications such as video game emulators or video playback or they are looking at under volting to save battery life by running your cpu outside of its original set parameters which varies in effect person to person because no two cpus are made exactly the same
27402 kernels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer lot of those kernels come from the pure stock kernel line of sources found on caf what these manufacturers do is take those stock sources modify them to suit based on the board chipset used also implement their own drivers take good look around you theres variations of touchscreens variations of wifi chipsets not to mention accelerometer sensors batteries compass sound graphics taking one kernel source from for example htc will not work on samsung and vice versa the manufacturers are free to cherry pick or out source various bits that get incorporated into the circuit board there is no hard or fast rules involved hence the lot of hacking modifications to get the kernel to work properly you must not ever compare to desktop linux distribution kernels in which it has pci pci express sata vga svga usb ethernet as they are totally different ball park game the major differences with centos and with androids linux kernel is this all drivers are compiled either as modules or built in hence any linux distribution will simply work out of the box again with desktop linux distributions you have one architecture x86 hence one linux kernel from say dell pc can work out of the box on lenovo provided that the bog standard drivers are compiled dont forget in the android world theres variations of the kernel built for specific arm chipsets such as armv6 armv7 theres tegra theres exynos and they are binary incompatible with one another hence if kernel is compiled for tegra forget it it will not work on armv7 the reason some kernels on android appear to be broken is down to the manufacturer some zte is one very good example release butchered source that may compile from source but fails to boot due to missing driver that is not covered by the gplv2 or gplv3 licence thats the problem hence some hackers have to go scouring around github looking for some clues some manufacturers if not all do comply the current incarnation of ztes source is purportedly to be but in reality its actually source base with lot of modifications thus does not represent the true kernel source for this is where the manufacturers have to release their respective sources not just out of being compliant with gplv2 or later but rather for the community to be able to mod it such as adding overclocking capabilities hence theres hacking involved behind the scenes and lot of messing about with drivers trying to get it to work and its not easy to debug either some drivers may be cross licensed but cannot be distributed depending on the clause and conditions as negotiated thankfully thats all changed now with kernel line of sources as android drivers are now integrated into the mainstream sources but theres gotcha try porting kernel to an existing handset that is about months old not snowballs chance in hell would it work thats because of the differing factors the sources is vastly different to the source and would take lot of hacking to get it working should know have tried porting source for the zte blade and failed likewise the latest kernel release when working on the ics4blade project over on modaco have made numerous attempts to port it but thats down to the simple fact that zte made very bad mess of the source which rendered porting nigh on impossible
27421 the reason is because androids linux kernel are generally not compiled on android itself instead it had to be cross compiled from another computer this causes various issues because the device configuration are not available on compile time and it is not feasible to compile generic kernel with all drivers due to space limitation whereas most desktop distros simply had all drivers compiled into modules loaded from an initramfs therefore developers had to figure out which drivers to package for each particular device not only that each drivers generally have dozen or so of compile time options to toggle various driver features and manufacturers usually do not release their official configuration the worst offenders dont even open source their drivers or didnt keep upstreams copy of the drivers up to date because manufacturers dont release their configurations often the slightly different configuration that the developer uses will expose subtle bugs that doesnt exist with manufacturers configuration driver programming is much more difficult than application programming as there is no kernel that shield you from the fickle hardware that have specific real time timing requirements and the such and this means even having different performance characteristic may cause the driver to miss some hard real time events from the hardware these misses may surface as either bugs or performance issues another issue is binary incompatibility there are two cause of binary incompatibility first is cpu type which has been covered by t0mm13b well but the other issue which is more relevant to porting is the abi incompatibility application binary interface if manufacturers dont open source their drivers then developers had to use the compiled module from stock rom this raises various abi incompatibility issues since the driver modules itself have specific expectations about for example struct layout and function calling parameters and when the kernel is compiled it does not have the header file to describe the abi at the time the driver is compiled so developers had to reverse engineer the driver to create header file or the header files in the source tree might have been modified heavily since the driver is compiled and developers had to revert those modifications to make the kernel compatible again with the drivers abi unlike compiling from source compiling for binary driver will not trigger compilation error due to function parameter mismatch or struct incompatibility it will simply just crash your device while its running and debugging these issues are very difficult in the pc world were familiar with the mess that nvidia and ati left us due to their insistence on releasing binary only drivers imagine having that mess for all drivers imagine the fun it creates pc hardware are also generally better standardized than mobile hardware most pcs dont need drivers for vibrators accelerometer gyroscope 3g radio proximity sensor nfc etc even on devices that have 3g it usually connects to the hardware using standardized connections like pcmcia or pci
27449 the pc architecture is built around commodity parts because it started out as clones of specific product the ibm pc that were specifically designed to be compatible with it and therefore with each other generally speaking you could take program or peripheral device from one pc compatible and put it into another and expect it to work that ability is useful enough that people have continued to demand it even as the technology evolved you can put pci express card in any modern pc just like you could put an isa card in any pc clone back then smartphones have no such history theyre designed as monolithic products complete system consisting of hardware and software that just works as is theres no expectation that people will take parts out of one phone and put them into another so engineers dont have to take interoperability into account when they design their products even within the linux kernel source tree theres lot of fragmentation in the drivers for arm platforms since phones are usually designed behind closed doors engineering teams at different companies often end up doing duplicate work designing basically the same hardware as their competitors and then writing their own drivers for their own design once theyre done and the product is released they go straight to working on the next one its not worth their time to go back and refactor the drivers for past products or merge them with competitors drivers the result is plethora of one off drivers for devices that are similar but not quite the same in addition smartphones are usually based on socs that have specialized hardware integrated together with the processor for some of this it can be more than matter of whether to load or not load certain driver the kernel as whole may need to be built with special configuration options for running on one soc which are incompatible with the special options needed to run on another soc

27582 the generic perception is that networking via wi fi cause less drain on your devices battery than connecting with 3g during the data transfer if you use both connections to perform the same download you will find that wi fi is more efficient since it transfers stuff faster than 3g thus leading to less consumption of your battery rare exceptions may prove otherwise but 3g faster and with stronger signal than wi fi is grandpas fairytale one important thing to account for is the network coverage if you stay large amount of time within limit coverage area either for 3g or wifi disable the one whos suffering from low coverage your device will constantly be searching for available network and thats just energy wasted on fruitless searches being this usually the cause for complain on the battery life
27584 already posted this in another answer as it where different details that time more general what consumes most here some details from reference motorola droid data taken from german article named energiesparplan heise is very famous technology publisher in germany google translate version here standard upload download standby 3g mw mw mw 2g mw mw mw wifi mw mw mw guess this definitly answers the question though the values may vary between devices relations should roughly match
27693 of course not your wifi will go through your wifi chip to ap and to some other isp there is no connection with 3g just like you can use wifi even without sim but your carrier canthough highly unlikely use some tracking program to track you and find what you are doing even if they do the wifi usage wont be counted as 3g one advice id like to give you is sometimes you think youre on wifi but due to many reasons you might not be connected to wifi and you might be browsing over 3g so just keep an eye for that
27699 on android wi fi is always used in preference to mobile data when connected to wi fi network this was quite clear in gingerbread and older versions of android which removed the mobile data icon from the status bar when wi fi was in use from honeycomb onward the mobile data icon may remain on screen when wi fi is active if your carrier handset manufacturer hasnt customized the firmware too much then on ics and later the active data network will be blue while the inactive data network will be white dont have one handy but believe on the s2 they always appear in white which is confusing still wi fi overrides mobile data
27703 this has some reasons lets try to sum them up android has an open app market model theres the more or less curated play store but you can install apps from other locations 3rd party markets or self built downloaded android may also not need antivirus apps most problems come from pirated rogue apps with added value piggybacked ios has strictly curated app store and youre not allowed to bypass it unless you dont jailbreak your device but apple so far ignores the existence of jailbroken devices apple doesnt allow antivirus apps into their app store they dont grant the necessary privileges to 3rd party apps and ignore the existence of jailbroken devices antivirus vendors want to create market for mobile antivirus solutions apple denies existence possibility of malware for their platforms as long as its possible for pr reasons to sum it up android is more open than ios and lets antivirus vendors jump in while apple denies them access to their app store
27704 the entire philosophy of the two competing app markets are different the android market known as google play allows any submitted application apps arent really checked or pre screened theyre simply submitted and anyone can download them any kind of app can be submitted to the play store even one that hooks into the core operating system this is double edged sword as developer can write malicious app one that steals your data disables your phone and other nasty things usually only when enough people complain will google take notice and remove an app while google does take some measures to protect its users the protections applied are automated and apps sometimes do slip through see bouncer stats show that it has been somewhat successful apps submitted to the ios app store have to go through strict vetting process apple hires testing teams they will manually inspect your app to make sure it does what it says without bugs doesnt use private or secret functions on the ios device and so on apps are run in sand box and cannot make any major changes to the way the device works since all apps are pre screened before they are posted on the app store there is almost no chance of an application being malicious virus data stealing etc as for whether or not you actually need an anti virus app well this question may help answer that personally dont think viruses are massive threat yet and although they may be later dont think its worth the potential performance hit besides bouncer can help with most malware id be more worried about data stealing apps especially if the app holding sensitive data isnt sufficiently protected last year skype wasnt encrypting its contacts database and malicious apps were able to simply read the data this has since been patched
27747 that is very interesting question am not sure if this can be done to scramble the keypads number layout every time on unlock to force you to slow down youve pointed out the weakness in the security smudges on the touchscreen the only thing that can think of is this wipe down the screen each time now you may get funny looks from others akin to taking off the glasses each time and wiping it cleanly to see again if you get my drift would not be surprised if theres soft keyboard layout that appears at random intervals but suspect its never thought of as it would drive users batty especially when texting the lock screens pin mechanism is in built and to override that mechanism requires going down the unofficial programming interface that does not have the approval from googles android development aspect almost bordering on using malware techniques to achieve it the other thing can think of is to use screen protector in that way the smudges will show on it but not on the actual touchscreen despite saying that one could theoretically sprinkle bit of powder on the screen and gently brush it away to see where the fingerprint is on but thats going ott on the other hand that is if you watch too much ncis my suggestion in the case of pattern unlock do not allow use visible pattern or use tactile feedback under settings location security settings to minimize breach but however your question is worthy from me from security viewpoint edit just an afterthought after exchange on chat it is quite possible in theory to use custom keyboard that is tied specifically to password input the ones that shows an asterisk in place and just randomize the keyboard layout with letters numbers re positioned at random intervals but that could have an adverse side effect as in darn it now have to be extra careful to not to go too fast or darn it one thing to do uninstall it as tis annoying
27748 one line script should do this on root ed handset be aware that this is for linux and hard coded for 800x480 screen resolution and also if your androids linux kernel has framebuffer support compiled in bin sh adb pull dev graphics fb0 fb0 ffmpeg vframes vcodec rawvideo rawvideo pix fmt rgb565le 480x800 fb0 image2 vcodec png png mogrify flip flop png rm fb0 and save it as for example screenshotter sh with executable permissions and invoke it like this screenshotter sh my picture of android home screen end result is png file called my picture of android home screen png is saved caveat emptor this requires ffmpeg and imagemagick tools
27750 you have great point and valid question looks like this was raised as an enhancement request two years ago if that means anything found two apps that seek to address your concern whisper systems has different method of working around smudge issues by asking users to wipe over the smudges they just created number track lock advertises the exact functionality youre looking for this is paid app that has mediocre reviews so proceed at your own risk neither of these to me are perfect solution id love to see this built into android perhaps you can find rom with something like this baked in
27777 ahh schneier on security unvy gb gur xvat tl dr it may be possible no one can say for sure and since no one knows if its possible you cant block it because you dont know what and therefore how to block but first let use investigate the statement step by step note that the article is from said mobile providers can google is certainly able to do so if you are using google services enabled device usually the ones with by google on the back but basically every hardware software manufacturer whose parts are placed within smartphone or traditional mobile phone is able to install backdoors in his products which could by used third parties to manipulate the device either because they bought this access or because the manufacturer is forced to for example by secret government regulation remotely install piece of software on to any handset thats possible and every time you install an app over the play store web interface you use this technique without the owners knowledge usually you will see visual feedback about the installation process at least until its running but the notification about the new app stays in the notification bar but no one can rule out that there is silent install method too which will activate the microphone even when its owner is not making call android apps are able to activiate the microphone if they have the permission to to so but if the app came with silent install method who knows if the permission for the microphone was also silently given and now how can protect my privacy as soon as you buy piece of hardware software without having the ability to verify the hardware and software components for surveillance backdoors you are lost but there are alternatives there have been attempts to create open source hardware and software for smartphones therefore allowing you to review the components for unwanted modules see for example opoenmoko
27792 round about way is to create java app that utilizes android market api presently it can search app based on keywords or package name the search query can be built to search for the necessary permission that is being sought little homework required but seems useful after downloading androidmarketapi jar and protobuf java jar of course you should have jre already setup you can execute the following java jar androidmarketapi jar myemail mypassword myquery you have to replace with as that is the present version and replace credentials and query for building query you can visit this page
27795 to answer this question is this possible one android phones and is there way to block it recently as far back as the start of this year there was uproar over small piece of software which was hidden in certain handsets and was able to monitor everything the infamous carrier iq bit about the carrier iq as quoted from wikipedia it provides diagnostic analysis of smartphones to the wireless industry the company says that its software is deployed in over million devices worldwide thing is no one really know for certain if they actually did as the security world got excited about it and started to slam back on the manufacturers apple htc samsung sony to name but few and exposed the ruse behind it all of sudden that hype fed its way into the android world and guess what happened an app appeared on the google play store carrier iq detector what was emphasizing is how the paranoia made its way into the norms of human emotions yes lot of people were really mad and demanded to know was there breach of privacy by the way if you look on the main carrier iq site here theres ticker that states as of now handsets deployed ok am not really sure if they are trolling us with that ticker but questionable as it was stated on the wikipedia that is deployed in over 150million devices heck it aint even there yes it is quite possible that there are back doors available to do just that kind of thing and is commonly associated with stock roms straight from the factory zte had one and was reported while ago and its publicly available on pastebin for the sake of historical information ill quote it here in case it gets lost the zte score is an android gingerbread phone available in the united states on metropcs made by chinese telecom zte corporation there is setuid root application at system bin sync agent that serves no function besides providing root shell backdoor on the device just give the magic hard coded password to get root shell sync agent ztex1609523 id uid 0root gid 0root nice backdoor zte it does show one thing and one thing alone stock roms all too often people can be naive in thinking that just because its stock rom it does its job now not to induce fear or paranoia into anyone which certainly would not wish to do so it helps to have cool collected thoughts about this the dose of reality will hit home once you realize how custom roms have better advantage over stock roms they are compiled from source code and is publicly available such as cyanogenmod aosp caf aokp rest assured you will be equally better off with those roms in the long term why for the most part those custom roms would be rooted anyway which will enable you as user to have tight rein on the handset in the way you want it not some fancy schmancy stock skin on top of the rom such as htc sense samsung touchwiz sony timescape etc and if the developer of said rom is trusted to be good good community feedback then yes you would be pretty safe what you can do to re inforce the belief that custom rom is better than stock any day is this knowing that the rom is rooted you can use droidwall hi surfing or another type of firewall to block access to those sneaky apps like that that will put in level of assurance but having said that its not about justifying why having rooted rom in the first place rather its to empower yourself over the handset and use it in the way you want if you dont like an app uninstall it if an app requires root then so be it it does make you think and ponder for bit in why carriers would rather have you to be stuck with stock rom and locked bootloader rooting will void the warranty unlock the bootloader youre on your own but theres always two sides to the same coin if anyone can get their hands on handset and unlock the bootloader it will simply factory reset and wipe the data upon unlocking and reboot so you can see how from security viewpoint in whats going on and the decisions involved know when made rom for zte blade was trusting that the source does not have any malicious code well it was coming from aosp source on google and yes its rooted and users feedback is good theres lot of thought in what was said and yes that kind of thing can be blocked if you want to be really secure block the following under droidwall here download manager downloads drm protected content storage media storage google services framework network location google calendar sync google contacts sync and finally block the linux kernel as well with those criteria selected you will most certainly not be able to download remotely nor sync either also pay attention to the permissions that is asked for by the app on google play store be prudent and you will have nothing to fear
27809 background only android devices that are licensed by the open handset alliance contain the so called google apps usually people associate apps like google maps google play store etc with android but because of the open source nature of android manufactures can sell android devices without google apps and therefore avoid to pay the license fee custom roms at first cyanogenmod shipped its rom with pre installed google apps in september the founder of cyanogen received cease and desist letter from google demanding that the google apps not be included in the teams roms since the rom could be ported to devices which are not licensed to have the google apps in turn that would bypass the requirement for the devices to be licensed for few days development on the rom ceased there were outcries from android users all over the internet and many bloggers suspected google had just shot itself in the foot eventually an alternate method was found whereby google apps are not included in the rom proper but the google apps which came with device would be backed up by the devices custom recovery or another app and then re installed onto the device once the new rom was flashed this would therefore google ify ones rom source how to install google apps generally speaking first download the package corresponding to your version of android currently november there are several distributors of gapps available each typically offers set of packages per android version each package with more content the apps in the packages range from lite package with the basic apps 100mb to all of googles apps200 mb the applications themselves are untouched if you dont want to or cannot root your device flash the gapps google apps package zip package with custom recovery you may first need to flash custom recovery like cwm or twrp using pc tool such as fastboot or odin heimdall this flashing in turn may require an unlocked bootloader on the phone if root is not problem see if you can root the device some stock recoveries will let you update with adb just install adb then adb command to install is adb sideload gapps zip assuming the package is in the adb folder and is called gapps zip you may also install custom recovery like in the unrooted case root typically allows android apps to flash new recovery without pc or install rom with the google framework if it exists for your device though many rom developers have followed cyanogenmods example of separating distribution if you flash gapps rom it may be possible to re flash with another non gapps rom afterwards while retaining the gapps this assumes the android versions are compatible most users capable of flashing rom will be capable of flashing gapps separately further references how to install google apps gapps on your android device phone
27810 you have to remove all your accounts from your device and re add them or just re sync your google accounts from the accounts sync menu go the settings accounts sync click on your account then remove account removed all of my accounts that had at that time hopefully you havent forgotten your passwords for your account after had done this restarted the device when my device came back on clicked on my google play store from there was asked to sign in my account
27819 not without rooted device or uninstalling freezing the other apps if you have rooted device you can control each apps network access using firewall app like droidwall or even more complex security solution like lbe privacy guard both would allow you to say which apps may access the network via wifi and or mobile network so you could even let them all work while connected to the free wifi provided by the hotel if you are not rooted but your device runs at least android or higher you could alternatively temporarily freeze disable all apps which should not use the internet

27833 technically its possible you can visualize it with play store scene play store can silently install when you send signal from web interface and update apps without owners knowledge mobile providers can also do this as long as their trojan app comes pre installed with device they can push and install an app to listen your voices how to block it root your device and hunt down all apps from mobile providers which could do such nasty things google can help either remove them from system or block their access to internet using firewall therere many firewall apps in play store flash fresh new custom rom like cyanogenmod etc

27913 you should also be aware of the fact that for getting backed up by googles native backup to cloud an app must actively support that it must explicitely use the corresponding api or it will not be included with those backups while not all apps support this euphemism theres nothing excluded by titanium backup as described the latter backs up really everything while the former only backs up some data from some apps another good thing to do from time to time is full nandroid backup which is supported by most all custom recovery images modes clockworkmod aka cwm once booted into recovery you can create nandroid backup make sure to have enough free space on your sdcard and having done this you can move it from the card to your computer for safekeeping if youve got enough space on your card you could also keep the latest copy there with titanium backup you can even extract single elements such as special app and its data from nandroid backup or if your system for some reason gets really messed up you can restore it completely from this nandroid backup again via the custom recovery

28010 this problem has been plaguing me ever since upgraded my sony ericcson experia pro iyokan from cyanogenmod android to android until today when did some more detailed investigation its pretty clearly defect related to the dhcp client when it manifests the device fails to obtain an ip address from any access point even those with which it had previously had no trouble switching to static ip address works around the problem few minutes ago found that deleting the contents of data misc dhcp and then resetting the device cleared the problem im sure it will happen again but when it does ill know what to do about it hope this information helps someone and perhaps leads to fix cant report it is an official bug because im using nightly build cm nightly iyokan
28036 using the google music uploader tool you can also download all purchased only believe music from any given google play music account you could then switch accounts or better yet different computer and upload that music to different google music account it would be manual sync process as the uploader tool wont automatically download purchased songs
28070 you can also use an ssh server without frontend app starting it with command or through configuration file as described in howto connect to device with ssh according to that page cyanogenmod included an ssh server dropbear in some releases cyanogenmod rc2 no longer includes dropbear or you could probably put it into your system yourself it seems that by default it is assumed that the server is run by root youd need root acces to your system but it must be possible to set up it to work without root
28081 flashcards are great way to study can recommend anki and ankidroid google code project page for android its fun to use and really efficient there are even existing card decks from various topics that you can use to learn extend with information and then share again to the community
28082 for learning new language pimsleur and rosetta stone approaches are considered to be widely accepted cant avoid weasel words ive used both in computer and am glad to know that rosetta stone has an android app named totale for this purpose while pimsleurs approach involves listening to audio and referring pdfs this approach can work out on any device where as rosetta stones approach is little bit interactive and can be done only through an application
28083 could list up bunch of stuff here now but that would get quite long so lets better organize it by groups covering multiple topics first of course there are mentioned flashcard apps best rated here are probably learn easy and anymemo longer list can be found at my androidpit overview vokabeln flashcards google translate version here these are not only restricted to languages as mentioned anymemo shows1 being able to also use images you can use it for everything think of images of molecules electronic wiring examples and others languages second there are the big language guides again can refer to an overview at androidpit sprachf hrer and the google translate variant here though this latter mainly addresses german native speakers the end of the list has some generic hints while flashcards co focus on learning words the more complex language guides also cover grammar and complete phrases guess best is to use combination as for the flashcards any solution should do they are mostly not language specific other with the language guides where it lies in the nature of this type that it has to be specific at least to the target language you want to learn examples here include french class demo3 and italian in month free4 third category should not be forgotten to mention here get yourself good ebook reader and add some books to it which are written in the language you want to learn recommend moon reader5 here which already includes huge online library list for multiple languages which actually is sorted by languages even so the reader immediately has some ressources at hand having trouble with some words while reading simply long tap the word to open dictionary either online translation or an offline dictionary like fora or colordict6 which both can deal with stardict files saved on the sd card being able to mark and even annotate with moon reader see the picture5 one could also use this app for other subjects classes number four now should be obvious theres that youtube app one could check some language specific movie clip with or get some other movie player moboplayer probably being good choice plus some videos in the targeted language guess number right music there are plenty of music players around and songs to pick repeating them over and over is baking some phrases to ones brains beside this fact there are also some audio books and language learning audio files around science so far on language learning but your question was not restricted to that as just notice so lets go for some more possibilities pointed out in the ap overview formelsammlungen referenzen google translate formulas references there are tons of references for chemistry like the very famous merck pte hd periodic table7 mathematics calculation helpers and references like mathematics8 physics references electronics stuff for engineers so learning is clearly not restricted to languages school organizers learning for school or study multiple subjects to cover and courses to keep track of this also can be covered using your android smartphone or tablet the ap overview dealing with this would be stundenpl ne und schul organizer google translate school organizers from simple timetables like school schedule9 to just keep track of what subject is running when and where to apps also keeping track of related tasks and even silence the device during classes my class schedule note the tiny numbered boxes on the blue items in the screenshot10 which indicate connected tasks you can find many solutions summary to sum up theres lot of stuff you can pre load to your tablet and then use to learn on the go
28085 if youre running android just use google chrome both on pc and android and associate it with the same google account this allows you to sync your browsers so that you can see open tabs from both locations on all devices you can even have multiple pcs oss synced just use the same google account sign in to chrome to sync your open tabs bookmarks passwords and omnibox data from your computer to your phone or tablet pick up right where you left off
28089 dont know of way to do this recently bought new phone and to save myself the tedium of manually installing odd apps went to the google play store using desktop browser it will already have list of apps you have installed under my apps so you can quickly spin through the list and install them you dont need to wait for each app to install
28090 there is no bluetooth le support in all current android apis at the time of writing that is api level up to android phone manufactures have to use the stacks of the bluetooth chip manufactures the only phone that has build in le chip and actually makes use of it is the motorola razor there have been reports that after the ics update bluetooth le pairing wont work any more so no convenient way to query device for le support and make use of it until there is bluetooth le support in the official android api iirc the linux kernel has no stable bluetooth le api yet too
28097 assuming youve previously installed appbrain and synced your device you can do the following from google play market download and install appbrain and fast web installer apps open the fast web installer and sign in with your google account same one you are using on play store open the appbrain app and sign in with your appbrain account go to preferences and then use the enable fast web install option under menu go to more lists option select the previously synced list tap the add all apps button and tap the back button tap the execute button and after reviewing the permissions tap the install button this should download and install apps in batch without having to confirm each one separately you can also create lists of apps via appbrains site and these lists should show up in the app
28102 depending on what apps you have installed apps like facebook twitter google and others will download data in the background to keep current when you open the app with ics you can disable background data usage for specific apps click to enlarge this is visible in the system settings data usage you should then see list of apps that are using data it will also show the highest usage app clicking on the app brings you to details screen that allows you to disable data usage or background usage
28115 check with your local public library talk to your librarian many offer research apps or free access to language tools my library gives me free access to mango languages for example unless they are very small they will likely have ton of other resources educational and informative as well if you are in the us you might look up semi local libraries in the same state most libraries in the us will give cards to anyone in the same state if the library has useful apps available for free theyll likely also have good web presence that will tell you what you need to do to access the apps probably just have library card and what you need to do to get library card

28158 in android say new paragraph
28164 why currently this cant be done when developer performs the upload of his application to google play the application manifest file gets read to database from where the search for apps is performed to allow searching for applications based on their permissions one would have to access the database and collect data that concerns the application manifest node uses permission previously read from the androidmanifest xml file where the developer has declared his application permissions while this seems quite straightforward google api does not provide means to this end strictly google play does not filter based on uses permission elements from the filters on google play filtering based on manifest elements uses permission elaborating essentially google play store uses the application manifest file to automatically apply filters based on the users device hardware specifications country carrier etc all of this is done silently without the intervention of any search parameters user either from google play or third party search engines can limit the results after they get automatically filtered by google based on personal preferences like excluding paid apps limit the results to apps that are compatible with the user devices among others but theres no way to interfere with the filters applied by google even if some how we get to that part the api essentially isnt prepared designed to filter based on permissions as mentioned above
28198 find the evil app there are several detectors available airpush detector airblocker airpush blok addons detector trustgo ad detektor lookout ad network detector so what to do when the evil app is identified leave comment on the playstore rate very low and point out attention invasive ads airpush report to google as the playstore guidelines changed these apps should be banned speaking about banned even if pay version exists this app should be dead to you same applies for the dev of the app maybe add this to your comment in wouldnt use any of the devs apps anymore and say so loudly giving them bad rep for bad deed hopefully they learn from that uninstall the app of course how to protect you for future attacks you can scan apps in advance before installing them using appbrain ad detector this app can be combined with appbrain app market slim and fast replacement for the over loaded playstore especially on small devices do not fear it is simply another front end for the playstore you can search the market oops playstore with this app and have the other scan your findings before you install any other app so you know what to avoid before you get annoyed
28223 the only reason you need to root phones in the first place is that the manufacturer has tried to prevent software choice on the phone platform the pc design is pretty unique in that it has had choice of software platform for so long that its an ingrained feature although with secure boot on windows devices this is likely on the way out
28224 you cant mount them because there has to be some software to communicate between the phone and your computer with the phone the full software stack needs to be involved as it needs to take into account what happens when you mount the device when its running also there are often multiple partitions on the phones raw mount would show up all the raw system files in the computers file manager which would be bad and things like windows would probably try and format the linux partitions as it cant understand them on newer devices you cant even do normal usb storage mount but you have to use mtp as they use internal storage which still needs to be accessible while mounted technically it would be possible for them to make some kind of failsafe raw mount mode when its plugged in while powered off or started with some button held down but they havent they do provide other methods of recovery instead also the firmware generally needs to be installed somehow there are scripts and so on that run to set up things if you have totally bricked the phone then there isnt much you can do but having said that flashing modern android phones isnt too risky and actually bricking it is hard firstly there are actually several images that can be flashed boot loader hboot radio firmware recovery firmware rom firmware older devices did have some issue when flashing radio boot specifically if you flashed them in the incorrect order and had mismatched versions you could actually brick the phone but believe that is mostly problem with first second generation android phones havent seen it being an issue on newer phones also you probably shouldnt flash radio of different region as you might lose special features like the hd voice for australians now days in order to actually brick your device you would have to be totally unable to enter hboot recovery and the main rom if you can enter any of those it should be possible to flash firmware from them although in some cases they might have security enabled meaning you are limited to flash the official stock images but you can generally break out of them and flash whatever you want hboot allows for fastboot flashing recovery and the main rom both have the flashing binary in them finally if you did totally manage to brick it you can look at using jtag to reverse it that probably does require soldering cable onto the phones mobo though as well as cheap cable and some knowhow
28231 where an app is stored very much depends on several criteria system apps pre installed bloatware apps are stored in system app with privileged apps in system priv app which are mounted read only to prevent any changes you may also find system apps in custpack apps subdirectories normal apps in internal memory go to data app some apps encrypted on internal storage go to data app private apps stored on external memory go to an encrypted container in mnt sdcard android secure as at runtime android needs them to be decrypted it will decrypt them and store decrypted copy on tmpfs so its gone on reboot in mnt asec you cannot simply look into mnt sdcard android secure directly from the device but if you use card reader and attach the card to your pc you will see the files there have the extension asec instead of apk from which you will get the connection to the name mnt asec the apps data are stored below data data package name internal storage or on external storage if the developer sticks to the rules below mnt sdcard android data package name

28315 solution available for devices for devices there is solution called adb backup note this only works for apps that do not disallow backup apps that disallow backup are simply ignored when creating backup using this way this makes use of adb so you have to have the android software development kit sdk installed on your computer on some linux distributions just packages android tools adb and android tools adbd note this solution will not back up and restore contact sms or calendar information the options for the adb command are adb backup file apk noapk obb noobb shared noshared all system nosystem packages the path of the ab file that will be saved on your computer this file is compressed file that contains an archive of the data apks from your device apk noapk indicates if the apk files should be backed up default is noapk obb noobb enable disable backup of any installed apk expansion aka obb files associated with each application default is noobb shared noshared enable disable backup of the devices shared storage sd card contents default is noshared all indicates that you want the entire system backed up you can use the packages filter to just backup specific packages or use all for full system backup system nosystem indicates if all the system applications and data are included when backing up default is system packages this is where you can list specific packages to backup use these if you want to back up only specific applications if using all you do not need to specify packages how to backup your device first you need to enable usb debugging on you android device go to about device or about phone or about tablet section in settings tap times on build number row usually the last row after that developer options section will appear in settings go to developer options section in settings tap the usb debugging checkbox second on your pc from the command prompt you will need to be able to locate both the adb command and your backup file the easiest way to do this is to run the adb command from the directory where adb is located in windows explorer navigate to where you installed the android sdk and shift right click on the platform tools folder this will open command prompt your window will look different than mine in macs terminal you can type cd and then drag the folder platform tools folder from finder to the terminal window and the path will be inserted hit and you will be in the right place in linux hope you know how to locate and cd to the parent directory of the adb command you are using linux after all from here type the following command windows adb backup apk shared all nosystem backup08262012 ab linux mac adb backup apk shared all nosystem backup08262012 ab notice that all doesnt mean all see the big bold note at the top of this answer drop the in the command if you are using android tools adb package if you want to store the backup in different directory include path for the ab file as shown in the screenshot below you will then be prompted on your device for password this is used to encrypt the backup to restore it works almost the same way windows adb restore backup08262012 ab linux mac adb restore backup08262012 ab then you will be prompted for your password to restore on the device now for the shameless self promotion droid explorer v0 will be able to handle this for devices while droid explorer is currently optimized for rooted devices this functionality will work for non rooted devices as well droid explorer will do full backups of the device and save them in userprofile android backups within that folder is folder named for the device and inside that folder are the backups double clicking on the android backup file will allow you to restore your device from the backup file
28351 if you are using logcat viewer in eclipse you can click the scroll lock button to prevent it from automatically scrolling down it is the icon on the top right in the screenshot above
28377 windows its easier what you can do is this from the cmd window adb logcat my logcat txt and just let it run now you can pause resume the scrolling in that cmd window same keystrokes for linux terminal iirc now launch an editor and open the file my logcat txt and there the results will show had there not being pause resume in the cmd window the file will get updated such as using notepad2 notepad or similar the in built windowss version of notepad would do very little justice linux from linux terminal under gui such as kde gnome using the two utilities combined found on most distributions multitail which is like tail unix utility only more powerful adb logcat want to see the logcat on the screen using ctrl to suspend then ctrl to resume the display and simply mouse scroll the terminal to back track seeing the logcat output the other way is this adb logcat my logcat txt multitail my logcat txt the first line above creates background process by using the at the end of the command redirecting any errors to dev null hence as the process is forked into the background using multitail can perform scroll back on the logcat
28454 if you delete file from your mobile device the file remains on your online storage to have the file permanently deleted you need to delete it from your online dropbox account accessing it via their website ive just run this exercise to prove the theory take photos sync dropbox delete photos from my device access laptop photos were downloaded access dropbox website and login to your personal account delete photos photos were automatically removed from laptop and notification was presented asking if wanted to undo the operation
28455 dropbox doesnt work the same way on android as it does on dektop platforms it does not monitor directory for changes in fact you only can download selected files which will be saved on cache directory on your android device the dropbox app would not instantly notice if you delete the file only if you try do retrieve the file again from the cloud the dropbox app would search for the file in the local cache directroy first if it isnt here it will just download the file again but you can delete file from the cloud storage by selecting the delete option in the dropbox app same thing goes for upload you have to select file in order to upload it into the cloud
28465 learning language could be really fun if you could snap photo of word in your native language ive only tested to translate from english worked and from arabic didnt work and find translation quickly to another for that found google goggles convenient solution that also doubles as qr code reader requires internet access google goggles only makes out the words in the image taken and thus you would need to also install translator google translate to direct your images text to for translation presume it isnt narrowed down to only google translate of that however am unsure also organizing to do lists could be nicely done on tablets phones wunderlist is my current choice to managing to do lists since it has both chrome add on found here and mobile app heres the link to that on android it helps you categorize your to dos through separate lists prioritize to dos only priorities either important by clicking on star or normal priority and easily view add tasks for nearing times such as today tomorrow and next days you need internet connection for syncing of the most obvious features for tablet or phone is to have any needed reading material on the go and easily accessible if however youre reading from your computer it could be more convenient to have remote to help you navigate through your documents presentation slides reading easily without having to reach out for the keyboard although this might seem as lethargic behavior it could be used to the contrary of purposes for example using treadmill while flicking through presentation slides or perhaps rehearsing presentation where there would be someone assisting with the slide navigation without the need to reach out to the keyboard mouse such apps would need wireless connection wifi and or bluetooth think it varies havent tried out remote apps much the remote app ive recently came across is unified remote for which you should need to download server on your computer it also has portable version havent quite tried out this remote or others so cannot give review hope this helps happy learning
28469 or probably you can use inverted conditions to do an opposite task if you want to run task when wifi is connected or when the profile is inactive you can instead setup contexts for wifi is disconnected and profile is active both with inverted checkbox selected and setup task that does the opposite if that is possible this basically works because of or notnot and not

28601 technically you can create full nandroid backup without rooting the device you just need to flash cwm or any recovery which supports nandroid backup over usb for example you can use odin windows to flash cwm to samsung devices after going to download mode all without touching the android so theres no rooting or root access involved at all
28738 you can use default app manager https play google com store apps detailsid com appiator defaultappmanager it allows you to set default app for picture music web pages video etc
28749 there are many variables that affect the performance of each method youve mentioned additionally theres also the necessary configuration and requirements that each device must have in order to have solutions like this working as requested lets summarize and compare possible performances between usb wi fi and bluetooth usb usb performance can be extremely low or very high depending on the available usb version which in turn combined with the sdcard reading writing speed on each device allows us to accurately measure and ascertain the transfer speed theres also the physical limitation of the usb cable length that for some scenarios becomes limitation usb mbit low bandwidth and mbit full bandwidth usb mbit effective throughput up to mb usb gbit mb which is more than times as fast as usb wi fi wi fi loses limitations like cable length but then again we need to account for the protocol being used the signal strength and range to accurately measure results protocol data rate per stream mbit approximate range bandwidth of mhz indoor outdoor 11a 11b 11g 11n with bandwidth of mhz more about wi fi protocols from wikipedia wi fi direct wi fi direct initially called wi fi p2p is wi fi standard that enables devices to connect easily with each other without requiring wireless access point here the communication is performed at typical wi fi speeds for everything from file transfer to internet connectivity essentially wi fi direct falls under the same values presented at the wi fi table yet again keeping in mind that signal strength and range are the key factors for good performance more about wi fi direct from wikipedia bluetooth while we need to ascertain several influencing factors to determine if wi fi is faster than usb bluetooth is with no doubt in last place when we speak about transfer speed designed as proprietary open wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances the maximum speeds are below the two concurrent options version data rate maximum application throughput mbit mbit edr mbit mbit hs theoretical data transfer speeds of up to mbit more about bluetooth from wikipedia android beam being fairly recent technology android beam allows users to transfer data between devices with near field communication nfc capabilities nfc is even slower than bluetooth both short range communication technologies and is limited to about 20cm of range getting up to kbit on positive note nfc sets up more quickly than standard bluetooth and the connection between two nfc devices is automatically established technical comparison aspect nfc bluetooth bluetooth low energy network type point to point wpan wpan range 100m class1 bit rate kbit mbit mbit set up time only relevant aspects to this answer for full table see wikipedia summary based on the specifications for each method and their respective version my classification ordered by fastest to lowest would be usb assuming version since is way slow and outdated wi fi wi fi direct bluetooth android beam
28802 the sensor is like small dot usually located on the left of the htc logo above your devices screen also the location of the proximity sensor is fyi htc one models evo 4g lte are very much alike in physical conception this is covered at xda developers forum thread where is the one xs ambient light sensor by tiersten left of the htc logo above the screen it is also where the proximity sensor is by jaaystott if you call someone take look at the front of your phone you will see steady red glow from the top left of your screen this is where the proximity and ambient light sensor are housed additionally theres this white paper ambient light sensor als applications in portable electronics that shows their physical aspect
28803 its hard to see it in normal light you may need to take your phone under very bright light to be able to see it bulb light or straight sunlight it looks like darker and smaller front face camera if gsmarena has said that it has light sensors then in my experience its near correct btw if you cant bring light sensor to work there is free software called lux auto brightness which does the job very nice and has many options
28814 just so that can play little with gimp heres the photo with the light sensor marked
28854 no easy way youll need to install custom kernel like glados or trinity kernel and the relevant apps for each kernel from the play store to adjust settings one of which will be the vibration intensity check out the relevant threads at xda
28858 afaik the vibrator motor that are used in the phones are called coin motor as they are in shape of coin they are of permanent magnet type accepting two leads for positive and negative dc voltages the circuitry that operate this motor just can switch on the motor for specific period of time and can change its rotation direction all other parameters of vibration are set by motors design hence for your need the amplitude of the vibrator motor has to be increased to make you aware and unless the motor itself is replaced this cant be done in my opinion this is specification of such motor and you can see its details update after searching google stumbled on more info about these motors with that information it seems that there are two types of such motors one being fitted with an eccentric rotating mass and another being linear actuator working more like speaker the article about linear actuator says that this is the present trend and beautifully explains how the motor works if the nexus device that is in question is vibrating at its maximum amplitude then there is no way any software component to increase its amplitude other way if device is not vibrating at its maximum then by increasing the applied voltage there is possibility to increase the amplitude thanks to konrad rudolph who made me to know more about this motor
28886 clockworkmod stores its backups in sdcard clockworkmod backup replace sdcard with the path for your external card if youre looking for backups to external memory with versions prior to you can move off or delete the entire directory to clear space the entire backup is self contained if youre using or greater version of clockworkmod this is no longer the case the information about the backup is still in sdcard clockworkmod backup but the actual data is now stored in sdcard clockworkmod blobs and is deduplicated between backups the upside is that this should save some space between multiple backups the downside is you cant just move off or delete backup directory with you now have to delete that folder and then run the free space option initiating new backup will automatically free space
28895 yes it does cost you more power the transceiver circuit is engineered with power saving in mind and will reduce sending power as much as possible if the reception is good this also reduces the sar value which is measurement for exposure of the human body to radiation if the reception is bad sending signal strength has to be adjusted accordingly additionally the underlying protocols are also designed to retransmit packages in case of corrupted transmission this might have an extra impact on your battery too
28899 if your android devices have removable sd card slot the fastest way to transfer big files is to physically move the sd card from one device to another
28900 from developers point of view my point of view applications on android work specific way they all have their own life cycle the main ones we are talking about here is when the application is paused or stopped onpause onstop and when the application is destroyed ondestroy these two states are brought to light in different ways onpause is when the user can no longer see the application or screen this is when the user presses home or clicks something on the screen that takes them to another screen like pressing link for example there is still possibility of you needing this screen for example when you press the back button to get back to the screen you still want it in the same state so the application is still open and waiting for you to return the other state when the application is destroyed can happen three ways firstly the developer might of added something in to close the application automatically for example the endomondo application you can press menu exit this will close the application and it will no longer be in memory the next way is the user pressing back on it as in there is no way to get back to the exact screen for example you cant press forward to get to it so the application is no longer needed so it is closed the third way that an application is destroyed or closed is when android needs more memory when this happens it clears the applications that havent had interaction the longest android does this itself if it needs more memory it will get it so in all leaving applications open isnt bad happen however some applications can still use lot of cpu power and not memory when its in the background if you think this is going to happen you should close it yourself android should be able to pick up on this however have look here at the states of activity or screen edit pressing back on screen activity destroyed onpause onstop ondestroy swiping application away on recent apps activity destroyed onpause onstop ondestroy pressing home application kept in memory only if the developer hasnt added self close feature onpause onstop navigating away from app link etc application kept in memory as above onpause onstop
28906 cell signal to add to ce4s answer you can check that for yourself if you take look at your battery stats they are always at little different place in the system menu sometimes in the main menu other times under phone info it lists the apps which used most of your battery one of the highest consumers in there is most likely your display and close to it youll find an item cell standby sometimes called phone standby this describes how much battery was used to keep the signal check that in times of good reception versus those of bad reception and see how much it differs network stuff this can even be multiplied if you have many apps running services to poll information from the net permanently like email apps using imap idle or some social chat app keeping push connection it looks like the same is happening here it tries hard to keep the connection and thus pushes the cell radio further due to the bad reception the connection gets slow and those services keep longer wake locks keeping the cpu alive to complete their task which again eats battery how to find out if your reception was good the system does in fact provide this information at least from android gingerbread on in the very same battery statistics mentioned before on top of the first page you find small graph1 tap on it it brings up bigger one2 the screenshots are in german but you still can tell the details in the first1 you see the cell standby titled mobilfunk standby right next to the display as said before on top of that is mentioned mini graph that tapped brings you to the page where you find the second image2 at the bottom here take look at the first graph titled telefonsignal phone signal the greener the cleaner bright green means good reception the screenshot shows this at the begin and end that is here morning and evening so at home have good reception getting yellowish moderate reception this uses more energy compare it with the graph on top of it not in the screenshot but the same as in the first screenshot and you see the bar is almost flat where the cell signal is good but falls faster where its not see the little red spots no reception and phone will power up like crazy to find new cell tower how to find out where the dead spots are here we need to use 3rd party tools will mention two of them here no signal alert3 and opensignalmaps4 both can alert you when entering dead zone no signal alert lets you view log of cell state changes plus can show you map of where the dead zones were3 opensignalmaps has the plus of showing you all cell towers in reach4 pointing out which you are connected to it also offers you compass giving the direction to the strongest signal how to automatically deal with those dead zones there are some little helpers available which watch your signal if it drops or gets lost they simply switch the radio off so it cannot further power up searching non existing signal and periodically activate it again to check whether the situation has improved one of them is battery saver5 which also lets you define profiles so you can easily switch other things like wifi then there are more powerful automaters like greenpower free battery saver6 which even manage lot more and these two are not the only ones
28910 the answer is simple do not close apps when possible android takes care of app managemnt by leaving them stick around which is not necessary in memory when possibile allowing faster startup times and resumption where you left swiping out app of the recent app list is similar too closing it but not the same
28912 just install contact vibrate from the description set different vibration for each of your contacts and know who is it set different vibration for each of your contacts know who is calling or texting you just feeling it when you receive phone call or text message sms or mms contact vibrate will respond vibrating differently for every contact you have defined if this particular number or contact has no vibration set master vibration will be called by default

28958 if you are using version newer than id recommend you use the delete backup function in cwm its in backup and restore delete and delete from external sd doing this will ensure that you dont delete blob that is being used in another backup as all backups now share the same blob directory after deleting from either place use the function recover free space from that same men to delete the unused blobs

29077 li ion does not need to be fully charged as is the case with lead acid nor is it desirable to do so in fact it is better not to fully charge because high voltages stresses the battery choosing lower voltage threshold or eliminating the saturation charge altogether prolongs battery life but this reduces the runtime since the consumer market promotes maximum runtime these chargers go for maximum capacity rather than extended service life source http batteryuniversity com learn article charging lithium ion batteries
29078 that recommendation from the seller was true for old batteries and it seems they still keep saying that to customers nowadays batteries are often lithium ion or lithium polymer and such batteries as have read many times and based on my own experience would be stronger if you charge them often the first time charging and wait until full discharge before recharge and dont use when charging are not applicable to these modern batteries li ion and li polymer batteries if charged often after about month would reach to their maximum performance and you are recommended to charge them every time you find an outlet in stock help application of my sony android device in section about battery life it reads charge your phone often this will not affect the lifespan of the battery

29185 in few words rooting an android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer people may want that for different reasons but the main one is freedom having rooted phone means youve got all the control over your device the main reason people root phones is to install custom rom custom roms are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer roms like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots custom roms can also become system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers you can see review of popular roms as an example here rooting android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you dont use or dont want besides those that violates users privacy see carrieriq another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege lot of useful apps were shown on the previous answer but you may find lot more available on google play you can find list of good apps here
29195 android passwords used with the built in email application are stored in plain text inside sqlite database this is in contrast to the gmail application which uses auth tokens as described in sachin sekhars answer for jelly bean the database location is data system users accounts db the above location varies with the android version this location on non rooted device is secured and protected by the operating system on rooted devices users have already technically cracked their own security and even if it wasnt in plain text it would still be trivial to decrypt as the key has to exist somewhere on the device to do it member from the android development team posted an explanation that till today still applies now with respect to this particular concern the first thing to clarify is that the email app supports four protocols pop3 imap smtp and exchange activesync and with very few very limited exceptions all of these are older protocols which require that the client present the password to the server on every connection these protocols require us to retain the password for as long as you wish to use the account on the device newer protocols dont do this this is why some of the articles have been contrasting with gmail for example newer protocols allow the client to use the password one time to generate token save the token and discard the password urge you to review the article linked to in comment which is well written and quite informative it provides some very good background on the difference between obscuring passwords and making them truly secure simply obscuring your password base64 or encrypting it with key stored elsewhere will not make your password or your data more secure an attacker will still be able to retrieve it in particular some claims have been made about some of the other email clients not storing the password in cleartext even where this is true it does not indicate that the password is more secure simple test if you can boot up the device and it will begin receiving email on your configured accounts then the passwords are not truly secure they are either obfuscated or encrypted with another key stored somewhere else aditionally since this issue appears to disturb many android users you can also follow this discussion at slashdot android password data stored in plain text
29198 gmails official app doesnt store password in your device your password is safe if you use this app this is how it works the password is used by googles authentication servers for the first time only after first successful authentication an auth token is downloaded to device which is stored in accounts db file as plain text for all subsequent logins this auth token is used not your original password so if your device is stolen all anyone can get is auth token which becomes invalid once you change your password so youll be in ultimate command for ultimate security id recommend you to enable factor authentication create device specific password for your device after losing device all you need is to disable that device you dont even need to change main password note these all arent true if you use third party email apps for gmail viz stock email app mail etc imap or pop protocol needs original password to authenticate users everytime so plain password needs to be available to email app before sending it to server so most of email apps store passwords in plain text hashing encryption is useless because hashing encryption key needs to be stored locally in this case id recommend you to enable factor authentication create device specific password for your device after losing device all you need is to disable that device update technically its possible to store passwords locally in encrypted hashed form without keeping encryption key hashing key in plain text locally thanks to sebastian for pointing it out unfortunately such implementation for android isnt available yet starting ics android provides keychain api using which an app can store password locally in secure form apps using keychain api are rare but stock email app uses it thanks to wawa for this info so your password will be safe with stock email app as long as your screen is locked remember keychain isnt safe if device is rooted and its not available on pre ics devices
29257 no app can optimize or maintain the battery in any way as it cant get the necessary access to the hardware probably not even if it required root this app explicitly advertises that it does not anyway the manufacturers engineers surely have already implemented all the necessary optimizations there is no way that the apps developers knows anything useful about every phones charging circuitry and battery that the engineers dont in short there is no way this app does anything useful at all it might even be malware but dont get that impression in this case note the following is probably not true the only thing an app can do on rooted phone is to recalibrate the battery if the battery is miscalibrated the os might think that it is as good as empty and force shutdown although there is still useful amount of charge left one app that does this is the aptly named battery calibration
29306 you can use airdroid it has clipboard feature and works over wi fi
29419 the only way to do this is linking apps to sd card first rooting how do root my android device disclaimer im not responsible to any damage you do to your phone although it is very rare for someone to damage his phone while rooting or myth and rooting might void your warranty some warranty policies void if rooted and some other void when unlocking bootloader installing custom mod did both actually second partitioning sd card linking apps to sd card requires second partition on sd card xda developers partitioning sd card third activating link2sd or s2e you can use one of these apps to link apps to sd cardi prefer link2sd link2sd s2e if you use link2sd you must choose the type of your ext partition at the first open of the app then restart if you restart and the app tells you the same message see bonus section of my answer fourth linking apps to sd card this is using link2sd didnt experience with s2e after activating second partition of your sd card you should now link apps to sd card note an app must be on internal memory before it can be linked if you try to link an app while its on sd card it will be moved to internal then linked so make sure there is enough space to move it when you long press on an app context menu appears press create link to link the app bonus manually mounting second partition first you must install this app to mount it terminal emulator then open the terminal emulatorand make sure you give it root accessand type the following each line standalone su mount ext2 dev block mmcblk0p2 data sdext2 now open link2sd and menu more quick restart it will restart your android system not your phonehowever you must do these steps every time you restart the phone not via link2sd
29441 to detect rooting status of device an app issues su command if exit status is it means device is rooted otherwise not to prevent this you can simply deny the root access using superusers pop up provided its allowed from superuser settings pop up appears when an app issues su command after this the app will get non zero exit status it cant determine rooting status update some apps can use other ways to check root status like checking the su binary file existence id like to admit that none are perfect methods without false positive result but sometimes they are successful with luck the best universal method to prevent detection restrict the permission of apps daemon cant suggest exact permission limitations because dont know functions of the app it can mess up with apps functionalities in the last id like to say technically theres no way to prevent detection by success rate in case of permission limitations the app can still suspect that something is wrong

29546 own an og droid and droid bionic and both phones eventually had similar audio jack problems on one phone found the issue to be wad of dust crammed in the jack which had to fish out with enter your choice of small pointy tool it could be result of the internal contact points being pushed back from repeated tension this would weaken the contact with the audio cable in your particular case dont think this is true however other things you can try pull the audio cable in and out several times wiggling it and testing it ideally youd want to test it with something that plays audio continuously so you dont have to keep hitting play getting different and potentially better quality audio cable to test with you can also try resetting to factory default which may help if the problem is software related as long as you have google account synced with your phone all your apps will be automatically re downloaded if all else fails take it back to the phone manufacturer or your phone service provider they should be able to fix it for reasonable price there is the option of trying to fix it yourself but that isnt recommended if you are uncomfortable working with small delicate electronics not to mention voiding your warranty
29579 three things that springs to mind channel number of the wifis broadcast for the ssid the identifier of the wifi network try changing it to another channel wifi sleep policy go into settings wifi hit menu tap on advanced keep wifi on during sleep set that to never lease time on the dhcps ip address theres persistent bug in the wifi driver well it existed in gb if the lease time is set to which is standard de facto for unlimited the wifi mechanism within the rom has difficulty in understanding that negative number for the lease time which results in similar problems with connecting to the wifi try setting the lease time to positive range eg seconds or hours and see what happens
29603 an sd card class basically the minimum sequential write speed that the sd card supports testing the class of an sd is quite easy just copy gb file to an empty card and measure the time it took for the copy class sd card should support at minimum 6mb also check out the markings on the sd card there should logo like the following the number in the logo describes the speed class
29606 recalibrating your battery wont actually make it last longer what it might do is ensure that the battery level display is more accurate so that when it says its at zero its actually at zero personally used an app like battery calibration requires root and it seems to help to be fair though havent actually tested the actual levels myself so its qualitative judgement if youre having battery life issues its more likely that you apps running background or otherwise that are draining your battery either go to settings battery and check out which apps are draining your battery the most typically it will be your screen then cell wifi radios sadly the only true reset is to go out and buy yourself new battery sorry
29613 android shuts down your os before it actually becomes completely flat in order to ensure it has enough power to do so safely and completely which is why you can power it back up again but then it shuts itself off again over time your battery does need to be recalibrated as the system stats on battery usage get wonky and the battery itself wont store as much of charge as it could for most phones the proper procedure is let the phone run until it shuts itself off without turning the phone on plug it in and let it fully charge up unplug turn the phone on and let it run flat again battery and battery stats are now recalibrated deleting batterystats bin isnt generally necessary you should find your battery lasting much longer now know this works well on my samsung sk4g go from not being able to last the day to being able to last full day and night if memory serves one is supposed to recalibrate ones battery like this every days
29649 specification sheets lie packaging lies the mark stamped on the card itself lies have lost track of the number of class sd cards that only run at couple of mb or the number of 32gb cards that have an actual capacity of 2gb if you really want to know how fast card is and whether you have been duped with card which is smaller than it reports and will thus corrupt your data when it gets full would highly recommend testing every single sd card you buy even branded products can be faked ive bought what appear to be high end branded products in convincingly authentic looking packaging which were actually fakes and failed when put to the test testing under windows the best windows test tool is h2testw from heise this page is in german the google translate version is readable even though the formatting is poor this writes unique verifiable pattern to the drive completely filling it since the pattern is unique it can verify that the data read back is actually the same as was written and that the card isnt reporting that it has higher capacity than it actually has since the class is related to the minimum write speed and sd cards get slower as they get full this also ensures that you are testing speed under the worst case conditions loosing one complete rewrite of the drive is small price to pay for peace of mind hardware required in order to get an accurate reading on speed you will need card reader which supports the interfaces on the micro sd card my card reader of choice is kingston mobilelite g4 as its reliable cheap and fast the g4 can make full use of its usb3 interface and supports memory cards with up to uhs ii up to mb half duplex it will of course be limited to usb2 speeds around mb if used on usb2 port on your computer if you need to test uhs iii device up to 624mb you will need better card reader though testing under linux osx there is an open source project called f3 which is short for fight flash fraud or fight fake flash which is very similar to h2testw for linux and mac but dont have any personal experience of this it might however form the basis for an android port the source code is on github there are also some guis for f3 f3 qt is linux gui that uses qt f3 qt supports f3write f3read and f3probe author tianze f3 is os gui that uses cocoa f3 supports f3write and f3read author guilherme rambo testing under android ios if anyone knows of similarly robust and reliable android application to test the sd card in tablet phone directly would happily update my answer

29744 brick is much hyped word that gets bandied about without understanding what it is theres two types of brick hard and soft lets go through this to make the distinction clearer hard this is where the handset will absolutely refuse to boot at the press of the power button diagnostics dead screen no power that is the symptom of hard brick reason this can happen by inadvertently pulling the cable when flashing rom or even an update via the handsets supporting software such as samsung kies sonys pc companion suite etc that is the worst case that is why in this scenario always make sure that no cable gets pulled unless told so by the supporting software in question the other way is this flashing in that manner when the battery power is low hence for that reason it is recommended to have at least of battery power in place prior to doing the update in that fashion its known as hard brick and requires specialist cables and stripping the device down to the circuitry board to revive it via jtag cables soft this can happen through bad flashing of the rom in which yields the following diagnostics it has power when the power button is pressed and or the screen comes on reason it can be user error on this part for example failing to clear wipe the data cache can cause android to go into bootloop because of the mismatches with the androids virtual machine and the apps installed or more than likely corrupted dalvik cache the other is flashing rom that is not designated for the handset which can cause the kernel to go into bootloop this is generally easier to fix but hangs that is known as soft brick with those two separate forms of brick it is generally speaking scaremongering tactic the one pure simple reason why carriers do not recommend unlocking the boot loader is not just for the warranty its more down to the fact if the handset ever gets stolen then unlocking the bootloader will wipe everything and reinitialize the handset to factory state thereby all your contacts call logs messages and apps gets wiped cleanly also this is to reduce the amount of support in the carriers with people calling in or ringing up the technical support what happened with my handset did something and lost my contacts just to finish off this answer you can revert it back by relocking the bootloader at later stage if you wish that is in the event the hardware got damaged and hand it back in for repairs
29745 the term brick usually refers to the stone which means device can only be used as paper weight taken literally theres no way to unbrick however you also find terms like hard brick and soft brick used which makes the term brick less absolute soft brick is something you easily can recover from count it as temporary paper weight mostly by software based solutions re flash your phone while hard brick is rather meant in the way the original term points to still technically spoken even hard bricked device could be unbricked but mostly this is more expensive then getting new device as for the warranty declaration you quoted for normal user its almost impossible to hard brick his device even when flashing custom rom this can rarely happen as there are many security layers involved almost always you can boot your device into some fall back mode where it is at least recognized by some flashing software so you could simply flash another the original firmware back which means the risk you are taking is to soft brick your device1 hard brick is quite unlikely with normal operations like rooting or flashing custom roms see also wikipedia brick rootzwiki brick just learned unless youve got samsung device and used the software recommended by samsung so better dont use kies etc but rather odin just to give an example
29851 my solution which seems to be working so far is quite related to what was proposed by t0mm13b that proposal was to adjust the dhcp settings however my router is quite limited in functionality and its impossible to adjust wifi settings on it insane know so set my phone to use static ip address instead of using dhcp so far so good
29883 use ota rootkeeper which includes feature to backup su and temporarily unroot the phone once temporarily unrooted it can re root by restoring the su backup in addition it also attempts to preserve root when you apply an ota update from your wireless carrier which is really nice feature
29912 llama will let you do this and it is free tasker costs money it has many of the features as tasker and locale and it can even use locale plugins have grown fond of this app and have set up many automated events to do this in llama you create two events and two profiles profiles create new profile and name it something like no notifications uncheck all of the volume options except for change notification volume set the volume level to create second profile and name it normal again uncheck all volume options except for change notification volume this time set the volume level to whatever you want like events create new event under actions click add condition and select calendar event use the defaults next click add action select profile and choose your silent profile create second event this one will be the opposite of your first event so change the condition of the calendar to event finished not current event and set the action profile to your normal profile the developer of llama is still working on it and adding new features and you can get details here
29964 sms generally uses the bit gsm encoding standard however quick cursory glance with google fu yielded this answer posted on stackoverflow which seems to say that apple uses utf unicode encoding this would explain why you got rectangular box as the handset is not able to decipher the encoding you can find out more here as per the standards document
29965 iphone emoticons are not character combinations like but they are single utf character of emoticons called emoji which are not by default supported in android by using some third party sms apps such as go sms pro and installing its emoji plugin you would be able to send and receive such iphone emoticons to from your friend
30102 use this am start android intent action main package name full class name to control an app youll have to put correct values of package name and full class name in the command for example you can use com google gmail com google gmail check mail hypothetical names as last part of command obtaining package name of an app is easy but obtaining class name of action isnt there are two problems many app developers keep class info private not all developers do smart modular programming its good habit to divide an app in multiple classes which could be triggered by intents but not all developers are smart solution of 1st problem decompile the app using apktool and see all info there are also other ways but this one is always working method unless app is based on ndk instead of sdk solution of 2nd problem nothing dont worry most of popular apps follow best programming practice and they provide public api from which you can get class info

30147 who or how it was fixed as 190mb the manufacturers decided that they probably expected that that size would be sufficient during the expected time they will continue official support for the phone can the size of partition be increased if youre rooted and installed custom boot loader yes partitions can be resized although not in way that will satisfy everyone since it takes space away from internal memory and many people also have exhausted their internal space it involves lot of work to test and debug and since p500 has very little internal memory as well at some point developers had to decide that its just not worth the effort tried tool but did not help after all the process completed without any errors still see no change in the size are there any other ways to do it what did you try hephappy rom developer had commented in xda page as no space p500 has 190mb for system partition and hence he withdraws the plan of developing jb rom for p500 is it then hardware limitation pretty much all newer phones comes with much larger internal memory you should consider an upgrade if you really wanted jb
30149 this will not change the partition size of system but uses another approach limit the data placed on that partition so heres what did before flashing cm7 on my milestone download the file to flash this is usually zip file otherwise the following wont work open the zip with your favorite archive manager alternatively unpack to an empty folder look inside the system app folder of the zip and remove apps you can live without make sure not to remove any app thats really needed by the system like the launcher this could be the calculator livewallpapers googleplus etc copy those apk files to separate folder outside the zip if unpacked to an empty folder now zip it up again as you removed lot couple of apps from system flashing will require less space there and no essential parts should be missing any longer now if you still want to use googleplus you can install it via the playstore which should place it below data so no prob or if not found there use the copy created in step to install it manually for this make sure install from other sources is enabled in your settings if in doubt whether file is really needed by the system itself better leave it or at least ask first but im pretty sure you will find enough easy removables so you wont need to touch those before flashing you could unpack the zip to an empty folder and check the size of system best make before and an after check it should occupy less than 190mb better give it some additional safety margin say less than 180mb for your action to complete successfully
30158 am start android intent action main android intent category home more info about shell commands an archived version of the androidwiki page
30205 you should be able to do this natively android and below in your launcher press and hold on blank area and click shortcuts select drive shortcut then your document and it will create link for you android and above open your app drawer and jump to the widgets section swipe until you get to drive shortcut long press and drop on your desktop choose the account to use if necessary then select the document
30225 if you want sane information recommend sane commands no offense meant just kidding so the question should read how to obtain log information from an android device and now we are on the better side there are multiple approaches which can be used utilize apps to display color coded log information utilize adb part of the android sdk to remotely extract the very same information use ssh from remote or local terminal app to aquire the information directly from the device to fully handle this topic it takes more than this simple answer if interested you can find more detailed information on many web sites or in andrew hoogs book android forensics investigation analysis and mobile security for google android which had the honour to translate into german there are probably many other sources as well so will just give few examples here to get you started utilizing apps the probably best known app in this context is alogcat available for free in the playstore and the dev will happily accept your donation for the other variant of the same app youll find screenshot below1 the app allows you to filter the logs to start stop recording log messages and even to store the recorded snippets to your sd card of course in plain text as you requested another app in this section is log collector which simply tries to grab the entire available log and send it via the share menu2 the android debug bridge adb the android software development kit sdk includes the adb command for various tasks amongst many others it offers the adb shell to execute commands on the device using this you can gather your desired log information as well just prefix below commands with adb shell command prompt on the device using terminal app android terminal emulator or terminal ide you can access the logs directly at the command prompt locally on your device little more comfortable this can be done running ssh server droidsshd or dropbear ssh server on your device and access it from your computer this way you can work on big screen while investigating your logs commands to access your log information there are lot of powerful commands you can use to access your log information from the command line and will only give few examples here dmesg the dmesg command extracts the kernel log dmesg pm syncing filesystems done pm preparing system for mem sleep freezing user space processes elapsed seconds done freezing remaining freezable tasks elapsed seconds done pm entering mem sleep suspending consoles use no console suspend to debug vfp pm save context saving vfp state pm resume timer in secs ticks at ticks sec successfully put all powerdomains to target state wakeup wake lock wifi wake logcat with logcat you can access many logging information but most times this will require root it has some parameters to filter the information by selecting the log buffer to read with please read the information provided on the developers page on logcat for details to give you two examples logcat events would list up events or logcat radio information on your devices radio modul dumpsys and dumpstate the two commands dumpsys and dumpstate give you detailed system information dumpsys currently running services locationproxyservice surfaceflinger accessibility account activity snip dump of service account accounts account name xxxxxxx googlemail com type com google snip dump of service alarm dumpstate dumpstate build gingerbread gwk74 cyanogenmilestone2 bootloader 0x0000 radio unknown snip memory info proc meminfo memtotal kb memfree kb buffers kb cached kb snip bugreport and if you are too lazy to remember them all simply use the bugreport command which calls all above and bundles it for nice humm bug report to the developer of course you can redirect the output from all those commands to file to copy to your computer and in most cases you should do so as your screen buffer would be far too small to handle it all bugreport mnt sdcard bugreport txt would be one example for that part
30278 this is positioned high in google so im gonna paste my solution here own sonyericsson xperia arc and the personal dictionary list was empty the way to go was to go into the app listing all apps find the xperia keyboard service and clear data it resets every keyboard configuration but its how it works
30341 compass calibration works by detecting the magnetic field intensity of earth but sometimes due to strong interference from other electronic devices like transformers compass sensor may get wrong idea about the magnetic poles of earth and can point in wrong direction so to ensure that it asks users to recalibrate compass by rotating in figure direction so that it can judge the magnetic intensity in all directions from that data it deduces the actual poles of earth
30348 you can check this in the honeycomb user guide basically it sums up to the following android settings as wifi networks incl passwords user dictionary etc settings of many google apps as browser favorites apps downloaded from the playstore additionally app developers can use this api to have their apps data backupd along but only few do so furthermore wouldnt rely on this backup there are many reports that while the backup works the restore not always does it seems theres no way to manually trigger it and on initialization after factory reset or with new device it often fails also as far as know its an all or nothing thing you can have it let all your backed up data restore as described before or not
30365 google dashboard is service for accessing simple view of the data associated with google account with dashboard you can also get list of your android apps that store data in the google cloud the dates of their latest backups the amount of storage they use and some additional data such as the date you first registered the device to access this information visit google dashboard at https www google com dashboard enter your google username and password and log in scroll down to section android devices click the more data stored about this device link under your device namess entry
30371 now with your latest details raw approach as you are on stock rom switching gps might not work out of the box in case it doesnt work take look at the secure settings plugin which should be able to help out assume your raw concept is 8am to 5pm is work time and you want different settings during work hours and after leaving work considering eventual late work issues so this should preferably turn out as single profile at work do and after work switch to so heres what shoud basically work profile work condition time from 8am till 5pm task audio silent mode on exit task misc gps on might need to be replaced by secure settings see above now we enter second profile and you probably do not even need gps profile afterwork condition state tasker profile active work invert state phone cell near scan your work cells invert task audio silent mode off so you see you neither need gps nor the 15min wait loop at 8am the work profile gets active and switches your phone to silent mode as you do not really need gps you can define some dummy exit task here again switching silent mode on as otherwise tasker would automatically revert to the before mode the second profile does not even check conditions before work has completed as tasker remembers which profiles are active after that it starts monitoring the surrounding mobile cells which are either known by the phone as needed for telephony if none of the surrounding cells match any of the scanned cells the attached task is executed and silent mode turned off but why so complicated much easier done like this profile work condition cell near scan your work place mobile cells task audio silent mode on done no matter what time you are at work your phone will be silent and no matter whether you leave work early or late silent mode will be switched off

30585 although this question is already answered and accepted would like to add to it sounds like what you want is pure location based profiles tasker is very powerful but if you are willing to try an alternative there is llama it is roughly the same as tasker except that almost every action is location based it learns location you want to set up like home by scanning the antennae of the mobile network in the immediate area that is lot more energy efficient than using gps for the things you want to set up llama will be much simpler to configure let the phone learn the places you want to use in your conditions and add one or more actions leave home do enable bluetooth disable wifi you wont have to worry about timings as the profiles only change when you physically actually move to or from location give it try ps am not affiliated
30733 according to the google play business and program policies you may re install any app you have purchased unlimited also if the app has been updated since you bought it based on my experience it works like that indeed have updated and re installed paid apps without any issue please note that the re install update also works on any other android device that uses the same google account
30745 on the samsung galaxy pocket gt s53001 you can do it without any third party software follow these instructions go to the screen that youd like to capture press and hold the home button center then right after that quickly press the power button if you wait too much it wont work and youll just set the phone block if that is done successfully you should be able to hear the classic click and also see white border appear in your screen go check your gallery application its possible that this works on all android phones running gingerbread but didnt try personally
30748 when you download an app whether free or paid it is tied to your google account so you can get all updates for this app as long as the developer is maintaining it every app has package name this can be something like com touchtype swiftkey this is the package name for swiftkey if you buy it the app is tied to your google account you can download it any time on any number of devices that are linked to your google account and as said above all updates are free in case of swiftkey we already received two major updates and if the guys at touchtype decided that they wanted more money from us they couldnt make us pay for updates for this app there are however two options that they could take make new features available as in app purchases or release new app with different package name you should its awesome
31807 while it may not be possible to run an smb server without root or using port forwarding it is possible to run webdav server without root for similar effect setting up an android webdav server on my stock nexus installed webdav server opened it clicked on the start button and was immediately able to see my storage sdcard folder in my web browser at the url displayed by the application http note that with webdav you also have the option of selecting root or dcim as well as sdcard as the webdav root using the webdav server through windows explorer then mapped http as network drive in windows explorer and could the access the contents of my storage drive just as if was connected via mtp but through drive letter sadly this solution is incredibly slow every directory change takes between and seconds as does accessing most files once file is accessed though it transfers at reasonable speed copying single 42mb file in windows explorer took around seconds so 700kb thus webdav via windows explorer is ok for downloading few large files whose location you know but browsing or syncing whole device this way isnt quick synced 75gb of data in around files and directories and it took hours around 50kb or files dirs per minute on average using the webdav server through windows command line even from the command line each directory listing takes seconds as does any file access copying the same 42mb file from the command line took around seconds so around 1mb using the webdav server through web browser the fastest option for webdav is to use your web browser though directly through the url given changing directory rarely takes more than second and downloading the same 42mb file from the web browser took around seconds so around 6mb the downside of using the web browser is that it only shows the date no size or type and makes no distinction between files and directories so if file doesnt have an extension or directory does then it may not be obvious if clicking on link will take you to another web page for directory or start download for file caveats by default windows limits the size of webdav downloads to bytes 6mb though this can be changed through registry hack filesizelimitinbytes in hkey local machine system currentcontrolset services webclient parameters if you know what you are doing webdav access is not secure even if you set password on the webdav share the connection is still http not https so it is not encrypted only use webdav on secure wifi network and certainly dont enable the webdav server while you are in an internet cafe or other unsecured wifi

31910 you can remount your external storage to be executable by running mount remount rw mnt sdcard this will remove the noexec nosuid and nodev flags but it will still be vfat fs you can make links to this fs but not from within the remount does not survive reboot because the vold fstab file will be read and they will be remounted at reboot with the noexec flags if you reformat any of your external storage to anything other than vfat then they will not be remounted at reboot and any apps that you have moved to any external storage will not be usable if you dont intend to use external storage for apps then you can unmount your external storage and use busybox mke2fs device to make it ext2 use busybox newfs msdos device to return it to vfat and make it usable again note busybox mkfs vfat is broken you will get something like lseek value too large for defined data type so dont waste your time all of this assumes you are rooted and have working busybox binary
31942 there are four things in apple earpod speakers microphone play pause button volume up down buttons for speaker and microphone apple earpod supports universal head phone config should work with htc samsung lg most low brand phones some motorola and some sony audio players microphone and even speaker will work sometimes but not well with nokia most sony most motorola for play pause button this works for most headsets for volume up down buttons this is very very specific and youll have to do some research on sites like pinouts ru people on the apple store say volume button works well with htc wildfire but im not sure
32077 the other answers are correct but fail to point out couple differences permissions system apps are granted the ability to request certain system only permissions that are never available to user apps this is not the same as root sudo su permissions one example that know of and use daily is the ability to reset the missed call notification counter have go dialer which is replacement for the stock dialer and contact app how you make phone calls when miss call android lets me know that with notification however go dialer is not allowed to reset this counter even though it asks for that permission when you install the app android and earlier let user apps reset it but made this permission system only accessible permission for android by moving my go dialer app to the system partition it is allowed to reset this counter root is not required for the app except of course to actually move the app to the system partition another system permission is the ability to set the current gps location now android does have preference where you can allow mock locations so any gps spoofing app you install can declare gps location but if the app is in the system partition mock locations can be disabled while still letting the app spoof the gps location updates system apps can be updated just like user apps but the update is never integrated into the original rom that is system apps have the unique ability to roll back to the version that existed when the rom was first installed move to sd android lets users move user apps from internal memory to the sd card system apps cannot be moved and always take up some internal space most all devices though have internal user apps on different partition so uninstalling system app would not give you any more user app space other than the dalvik cache being removed you will recover some space if you uninstall any updates to system app as noted the updates are not integrated with the rom and are thus stored in user space the updates are not allowed to move to the sd card either but if removed user space is recovered how it affects you if you are casual android user you likely wont run into scenarios where system vs user app would make difference if you are an advanced user you likely have root and can thus change system app to user and vice versa if you ever run into one of these situations

32592 this was left as an edit to another post by an anonymous user but should be its own answer go to the google play app on your mobile phone and go to menu my apps then swipe across to all apps delete the app from there using the symbol button on the right and the app will also delete from the online play store list in order to delete several applications at time long press an application until blue top bar appears then short press some other applications and you will be able to delete all selected applications by pressing the deletion symbol in the upper right corner in the blue bar this is especially practical because you jump to the top of the list after deleting an application and the list is only sorted by date of first installation at least at this moment

32905 there are lot of alarm clocks around and one of them should solve your issue im using alarmdroid which in its advanced settings has an option saying rings max minutes set by default and just below checkmark for change to snooze mode afterwards also enabled by default so you could disable snooze mode which would solve your issue as the alarm would automatically turn off after minutes though id prefer to have snooze mode plus an option to say stop the alarm after xx if the user did not respond some other app may have that or it could be requested of the developer the argument of shomer shabbat may be convincing for him as pointing to group of interested customers which might chose his pro version for this feature edit while searching for something else just stumbled upon shabbos alarm the name alone seems to answer your question doesnt it it allows you to set multiple alarms choose which ringtones you want to ring and set how long the alarms will ring for it works perfectly whether you call it shabbos alarm shabbat alarm shabbis alarm or any other kind of alarm for that matter didnt try it out yet but thought you might be interested to hear about

33153 python php specific if you are asking specifically for python and php scripts sl4a probably is your best choice though there are other python supporting apps in the playstore like qpython lite and if you want to automate things you might want to take look at the sl4a script launcher in connection with taskbomb task scheduler as well shell scripts but talking about linux and scripts in general the first coming to my mind are shell scripts these can be run directly from the command line using any terminal emulator android terminal emulator terminal ide or if you prefer some graphical help using specific launcher apps like sh script runner scriptme or script manager

33325 yes all android devices will work without sim card and can be connected to wifi for an internet connection edit just so people know there is setting in the build prop file that determines whether or the not the device can be used without sim or not most of the time this is set to allow it however in rare cases it may be disallowed
33333 some android devices mostly older ones and cdma2000 devices will attempt to let you not use them without activation usually the provision application has secret code that can bypass the mandatory activation on the motorola droid global its upper left corner upper right corner lower right corner lower left corner the lower corners being above the software buttons not the absolute corner of the screen do that and you can use the phone unactivated for battery life considerations put the phone in airplane mode newer devices including the n4 should just let you skip the activation altogether lot of the google applications will continually beg for google credentials however if you dont log in

33707 for this question you might want to check with the wikipedia article on liio batteries quoting avoid deep discharge depletion and instead charge more often between uses the smaller the depth of discharge the longer the battery will last avoid storing the battery in full discharged state as the battery will self discharge over time its voltage will gradually lower and when it is depleted below the low voltage threshold to cell depending on chemistry it cannot be charged anymore because the protection circuit type of electronic fuse disables it the rate of degradation of lithium ion batteries is strongly temperature dependent they degrade much faster if stored or used at higher temperatures and may even be stored in refrigerator the first point already answers your question youd better avoid to deep discharge your battery best is to always keep it on or up but should already cry for charger theres no memory effect or the like so no need for that you might refer to the so called battery calibration which today is called myth by most as explained by google developer dianne hackborne if you think full charging cycle that is what you describe might be useful from time to time also see lie ryans answer for this make the interval between them as large as possible imho multiple times month is much too much once every month should be enough in that timeframe it might even accidentally happen you nearly run out of juice unwittingly so you can use that chance
33720 once or twice month full battery drain and then charge helps increase the battery life that is incorrect full discharge is never beneficial to lion battery capacity the battery life of lion battery is dependant mostly on temperature discharge rate and age in fact low charge state actually is harmful to lion battery capacity although modern batteries have circuits that tells the system to shutdown before it became really harmful to the battery it is best for lion battery to be plugged in as often as is convenient also gives more accurate battery readings as for calibrating battery meter by full discharge recharge that is partially true modern smart battery comes with microchip to keep track of the state of charge the following is quote from hp regarding smart battery system in their laptops repeated short discharges and recharges cause increasing inaccuracy between the state of charge of the battery and the power meter readings periodically the battery needs to be calibrated to relearn its usable capacity so it can synchronize its charge status with the power meter the user simply has to periodically discharge the battery until the capacity alarm is received the need to perform this procedure will vary with individual use in general li ion battery should be calibrated minimum of once every months battery that is seldom discharged completely should be calibrated about once month and the following is from battery university how often does battery need calibrating the answer depends on the application for practical purposes calibration should be done once every three months or after partial cycles if the portable device applies periodic deep discharge on its own no additional calibration will be needed the need for calibration comes from the mismatch between the batterys chemistry and the microchip that estimates the batterys state of charge this mismatch develops over numerous partial discharge although unlike the memory effect in nicad battery it does not affect the batterys actual chemical capacity and is reversible by letting the battery relearn its bottom and top charge state do not do calibration too often since deep discharge does permanently harm lions actual capacity

33831 im using combination of apps diskusage and link2sd and theyve helped me keep storage use at bay both on gingerbread and on ics the issues had with the built in storage management facility of android were it only shows the space used by the app installation doesnt count resource downloads common in games the size reported on the list of installed apps doesnt consider cache usage so you have to guess and go looking in the details of suspected apps diskusage is excellent at locating resources that may be taking up lots of space and may be even be left behind when the app that downloaded them is uninstalled but if you have lots of small to medium sized apps installed or if youre using many apps that stay online link2sd allows you to quickly locate any misbehaving one it shows you list of all installed apps and allows you to sort them by name install date install size apk dex lib option data size cache size or total install data cache size if you have many apps showing lot of cache usage link2sd can also clear all of them at once with the clear all app caches option also if youre using gingerbread be aware that apps moved to sd card keep part of themselves called dex on internal memory and the size of this dex varies from one app to another with link2sd you can sort by dex size and quickly find any apps that may be too big to keep installed on certain phones even if they allow moving to sd im looking at you google client or the other way around you can sort by apk or lib and move to sd all apps that show near the top and allow being moved

34000 the screen size is 151mm 94mm http forum xda developers com showthread phpt
34011 you can always use some mathematics to obtain screen size sqrt vr hr where sqrt square root screen width diagonal screen size for nexus vr vertical resolution hr horizontal resolution which for nexus we have vr hr so sqrt inches 94mm 6x inches 151mm so we have 151mm 94mm which peanut has linked to
34015 so you want to know the display area the non masked clear area of the front face simple metric ruler and asus nexus gives you answer 152mm 95mm or the area of active pixels on the ips lcd display display pitch dpi pixels per inch leading edge to leading edge pixel size of pitch guesstimate without engineering drawings pixel geometry square identical height width display size in pixels screen area mathematical height pitch pixel width by width pitch pixel width by by mm answer 4mm 0mm addendum actual diagonal width for asus nexus display area square root height squared width squared square root squared squared square root mm mm convert to inches answer 4mm or in
34062 theres no option to resume if you stop you can only manual download later if you didnt pressed stop you could just disable data transfer and when connected again download will continue if you stop the current sync state will be sent to the server and it will be without the apps that werent installed stored as the device final state after restore and by the way clear market data will not help tested times on reflash my desire
34155 there isnt system setting so the app smart rotator is probably the closest thing you can get but yes in the beginning you have to set everything up yourself
34166 alternatively my default recommendation for cases like this tasker use profile like this abstract condition app select youtube and optionally other apps you would like to have autorotate turned on task display display rotation set on this way whenever one of the selected apps runs in foreground autorotate is turned on and as soon as that condition is no longer met autorotate is turned to whatever it was set to before to make sure to have it turned off afterwards you can add so called exit task exit display display rotation set off hm looks like currently answer every 2nd question with tasker
34188 go to settings display daydream and select your desired daydream after this tap when to daydream and select when you want it to work now when you charge dock the device leave the screen on and after while the daydream will start for me this required me not to lock the screen manually by pressing the power button and disabling stay awake from developer options
34189 heres what need to do 1st step launch the settings app scroll to the bottom and tap about phone 2nd step in the middle of the screen is the listing for android version tap this item until you see jelly bean appear on your screen you can then tap and hold the giant jelly bean until your device vibrates you should then see interactive beans floating all over your screen and yes you can fling them go ahead try it 3rd step after doing this the beanflinger daydream will be unlocked you can find the daydream option by going to settings display daydream hope it will help to all of the users facing this same kind of problem
34238 edit to only sync the calendar you first have to switch off everything else go to settings accounts your google account and un check all the sync targets you dont want chrome gmail drive contacts edit then you can take care of when to have it sync generally this is left to 3rd party apps you can always pick your favourite 3rd party app to get that feature and there is ton of it some samples juicedefender free plus ultimate beta youll probably have to buy ultimate for the feature you want tasker llama not sure if it supports your use case or just search google play for profile sync schedule or similar the latter two examples are somewhat complicated to set up but are very powerful id try juicedefender
34240 too complicated there are lots of automation apps available on the market which you could use to toggle this stuff depending on the connection available my favorite again here tasker you could create profile and call it autosync condition state wifi wifi connected task auto sync turn on exit auto sync turn off once set up you can forget about it tasker takes care for it automatically afterword though tasker is my favorite it might not be the easiest solution for everybody takes some time to get used to it costs some euro but is really worth both no other tool gives you so many possibilities and flexibility if thats too heavy for you there are some alternatives available check the playstore for llama and also watch out for the other users also installed part of the pages oh if you insist on an optional widget for your homescreen thats what the desktop is usually called here tasker allows you to create them for its tasks as well
34303 adb push will copy any file to the phone whereas adb install will only accept an apk file and will install it onto the device
34306 more specifically adb push file path will take file from the pc and copy it to path on the android device adb install apkfile will copy apkfile from the pc into data app on the android device the main difference being that push will let you specify where you want the file to go on the device and install puts it in known location the location installed apps exist in
34363 its device internal codenames reasons device specifications is secret before release after release firmware not renamed to exclude misunderstanding for developers one device may have different firmware versions depends on target market and hardware configuration modem nfc wi fi settings
34364 you should be able to make phone calls easily in the command line assuming you have root the command is service call phone s16 this will automatically start calling that phone number however this is all done in the foreground if you had the phone you would see the normal call screens show up if you were trying to launch phone call behind the scenes without the user knowing im not sure how you would do that also this is only for sending calls not receiving and you cant pipe sound file to the call in lieu of using the actual microphone nor can you record the incoming sound more information android call dial from the adb shell command line
34366 for galaxy nexus these are different builds takju devices sold through the play store in the us contains the google wallet aplication yakju devices sold through google outside the us yakjuxw devices sold by samsung if you buy yakjuxw would recommend that you update to yakju with factory images provided by google this way you will get the updates in time wasnt aware that there are similar builds for the nexus
34393 no you do not need to fully charge any battery to the max until usage it does not matter if its new old phone or even remote it does not affect the battery unless that battery has been over used so what am saying is no you do not need to fully charge something new before usage
34455 its supposed to represent hearing aid and it means that hearing aid compatibility is enabled it should go away if you go into the call settings and disable the hearing aid option itll either be something like settings calls or pressing the menu button on the dialer to get into the call settings think it varies some supporting source second source
34466 user rds has given the correct answer about how to fix this problem but can tell you that this issue happens mainly after stopping google services framework this is practice that some people recommend in order to be able to get otas when delayed to be available for your phone had android but was trying to get recently released bug fixing update so just did this stop google services framework but after updating android and restarting my smartphone got that infamous rpc aec error when trying to get some updates for my apps first tried unsuccessfully what anthony says then did what rds says removing adding my google account and the problem has gone let me add this is not the first time get that error but it is until now that realize both the reason and the solution so im sharing this with you
34526 this could be caused by flashing an incompatible gapps package if thats not the case and you are sure you have the correct compatible gapps installed try the following open the google play app and press the home button to return go to settings applications manage applications select the all tab search for google play store and press it to open press clear cache press force stop return to settings applications manage applications press google services framework press clear data press force stop start google play store and it should give an error reboot once your device has restarted google play store should work wait minute or too if it doesnt this should help if corrupt cache is the cause of your problems corrupt cache might lead to strange error messages amongst others if it doesnt help you might try the same steps but include clear data for the playstore app
34646 for the galaxy s3 this indicates that the telecoil mode aka mode or electromagnetic coupling is active as eldarerathis mentions this is type of hearing aid comparability it involves using the speaker coil in specific manner to inductively couple with compatible hearing aid in this mode the hearing aid shuts off its microphone and receives audio only from the phone effectively eliminating background noise and giving better performance than just using the hearing aid to pick up and amplify the phones normal audio which is known as mode or acoustic coupling
34685 what will call workaround for the present as it is not simple solution as allowing offensive words in voice typing but it has the same final affect under settings choose language input choose personal dictionary click the plus button in the top right enter the offensive word under the phrase and shortcut spaces click the back button system or top left enjoy your custom swipable profanity
34688 the best are backup methods that backup and restore app data titanium backup is excellent for this and easy to do especially with the pro version it allows you to backup the apps including the relevant app data which holds the game progress the pro version lets you restore them seamlessly while the free version requires manual re install like astro you can also sync these backups to online storage spaces like dropbox or google drive if you have multiple devices have tablet and phone that like to sync progress on for example datasync is by far the best option it can sync to dropbox or strictly device to device but can sync all the app data with game progress to another device for subsequent use or resyncing back to the original device later let us know what you choose
34709 google presentation remote is great and really easy to use on your android phone it is dependent on the chrome extension google presentation remote
34715 another fool proof method no need to worry about having specific backup app is to grab the games data directly the data for all user installed apps can be found in data data package name this will be all settings saves and anything else just browse into there and copy the relevant directories to somewhere safe and put them back when youre done flashing and have reinstalled the app and run it at least once yet another way which will work without root is you do the same as above but using adb turn on usb debugging connect up to your computer and run adb pull data data package name where you want the files then once youre done with your rom flashing and have reinstalled the apps do adb push where you put the files data data package name or if you now have root with your custom rom just copy the directories you pulled to the sd card and put them back in data data on the device
34731 was annoyed by the exact same problem so have programmed an app that automatically saves your wallpapers and your live wallpapers too it makes it easy to revert to previous wallpaper it is called wallpaper saver by appdictive and its free in the play store it does not require root access
34758 android does not natively back up applications so you cant undo an app update best thing id say you can do is something like this howto it backs up your apks and their settings it uses titanium backup and requires root but rooting is not your problem
34760 unfortunately once the new version is installed there is no way for you to roll back the only way you can get back to the old one is if you already have copy of or can manage to find the apk file for the version that you want
34788 the theory is that you should not need to know when the developer publishes an app there is manifest xml file that describes the required capabilities these can be both hardware and firmware related you need minimum android version or you need specific hardware feature like gps google play then automatically filters which apps you can see and install based on these requirements the developer can also impose geographic requirements and potentially carrier requirements as well as disallowing specific devices if they want to in your case the obvious thing to do is to first check if the developer has website with any more information if thats of no help try emailing them the filtering can be tricky and catches developers out if the developer is at all responsive they should come back to you it is in their interest to have the app work on as many devices as possible normally so if there is no good reason for it to be incompatible with your device they should appreciate the opportunity to work out the issue if there is valid issue then your question may help prompt them to make the information available on website or in the description
34806 as the other answers already state requirements are stored in the apks manifest there are several tools available to help you analyze this file as is described at stackoverflows question how to view androidmanifest xml from apk file examples given in the answers include android apktool aapt as also explained by dianne hackborn then there also are manifest explorer axml2xml pl android xml parser and probably many more
34809 you most likely have hotspot timeout setting enabled you can disable it by going to your advanced hotspot settings and editing the timeout value to never note that in some versions of android in order to access the advanced hotspot settings you need to first access the wifi hotspot settings and then press the phones menu button
34970 in short this is very good question but am afraid it warrants more than just making the end user aware redesign the kernel to eliminate wake locks and use more thorough efficient way of managing the principle better thereby prolonging battery life unfortunately it has been accepted as de facto solution to enable power management despite it is not exactly efficient either there was an extensive discussion about wakelocks with gregh kroah hartman the linux guru for drivers development am googling for the exact linky other sites such as lwn net and another article explained on the same site here this was the article gregh kroah hartman referred to this blog in which he appears to agree with the alternative solution proposed by rafael wysocki have documented lot about the potential alternative am not sure if that is actually in place in the more modern kernel v3 badly designed apps can and often request wakelocks such as keeping the screen on but in fact in this scenario for keeping the screen on there is in fact more efficient way to do this getwindow addflagslayoutparams flag keep screen on whilst striving to keep this clear of jargon etc for the end user really the core of the issue boils down to the kernel code in how the wakelocks are managed here is brief summary on xda on what is wakelocks for the uninitiated by using betterbatterystats one could see exactly which process is draining the battery the wiki is hosted on github and is available on the market here
34972 how can tell im affected this is probably the first question to those not familiar with this topic with gingerbread android and above youve got service aboard helping you to figure out battery statistics though manufacturers tend to place it at different points its mostly found in settings about the phone battery or similar and shows list of the apps having used most of your battery on top of that is small graph tap that and it brings you to screen similar to this one screenshot of battery statistics on android chose screenshot from one of my devices which illustrates the issue looking at the lower two blue bars aktiv device was kept awake active bildschirm an screen on the right most blue bar on aktiv indicates wakelock device was kept busy despite the fact the screen was turned off so by this we can be pretty sure weve got wakelock but we cannot tell who caused it if your device does not offer this screen or the bars at the bottom just discovered the lg optimus 4x running android has cut these bars off you can find them using gsam battery monitor similar information from gsam battery monitor here the mentioned blue bars are yellow orange what caused the wakelock unfortunately this question cannot be answered using pre installed apps except for maybe some custom roms but there are tools available that can the best known candidate for this is betterbatterystats and shows us the cause in its partial wakelocks section screenshots from betterbatterystats in the first example2 taken from the apps playstore page the event causing most of the wakelocks was desired one we dont want the playback stopped while listening to music so the second example3 taken from real case on one of my devices might prove better the topmost events are caused by the very same app which needed the wakelock to keep the imap push service active for an alternative to betterbatterystats check out the wakelock detector app mentioned in uzumapps answer which seems easier to handle especially for non techies wakelock detector click image to enlarge source google play what can be done if the case is as clear as in the second example in the previous section the action is quite obvious at least in my case dont need to be informed immediately when mail arrives delay of 30min is absolutely acceptable so went into the mail app disabled imap push see also push email and instead switched to 30min poll interval wakelocks did not entirely disappear but dropped markably battery life improved noticably then theres the case mentioned in the question itself bad behaving app not releasing its wakelock confront the dev with your findings and ask for fix if he delivers problem solved if not theres almost always an alternative app available what if it is the android system itself yeah sometimes it looks like just that or more consumed by some android service oh if its in most cases the candidate is named locationmanagerservice bad guy spying at us not necessarily in this special case the listed bad guy is not even guilty at least not directly here it is another app requesting the current location too frequently theres an excellent article on setera org about this pinpointing android locationmanagerservice battery drain to give an abstract it uses androids dumpsys feature requires root to dump system state and lets you investigate the listeners established for the locationmanagerservice closer look at their configuration shows which are constantly hammering it for location info some do so permanently without break as the apps id is listed along and at another place in the dump even together with the apps technical name you can still identify it and take appropriate actions and what about ufos unfortunately there are such apps which registered wakelock and then exited without releasing it whats left are unused ing obsoletes wakelocks held for no use so no way to simply bring the app to foreground and re configure or making it release its wakelocks here the only solution known to me is reboot and would like to have better solution of course if you know the guilty app the steps concerning it are the same as above inform the dev get fix or replace the app but about getting rid of the current wakelock maybe somebody else can provide better alternative to the reboot are there some recommended further readings sure one for now may add more later guide wakelocks definition and how to prevent them xda developers march
35055 use the irig pre interface euro us dollars to connect any xlr mic to my htc wildfire in flightmode can make good 48khz mono wav recordings with the taperecorder app when switch flightmode off there sometimes are some ticks and clicks afterwards you cann edit your recording and convert it into mp3 files
35094 killing all running apps didnt solve the problem nor did disabling the automatic sync for google account items like videos photos which heard suggested for similar battery issue what did work was simply rebooting the device by holding the power button and picking shut down after rebooting mediaserver no longer appears to use much of my battery in the usage chart and my charge lasts like it always did so if you get the same issue just reboot
35214 you can search your contacts easily by typing letters the dialer instantly interprets the input phone number also as text input just like t9 does and shows contacts that match below the actual number for example if you want to dial smith you should dial no need to press three times to get

35344 yes regular set of headphones will work just fine in much the same way that single channel earphone works in stereo headphone jack the other bits are for the microphone and the controls but since your headphones wont have those it wont matter have had occasion to use 1st generation ipod earbuds as well as some generic earbuds in my galaxy nexus my daughter uses pair of headphones had lying around that are probably ten years old in her phone when shes at home listening to music at worst you may find channel doesnt work no sound in one ear but you dont need to worry about shorting out or damaging anything wikipedia has more information than you could possibly want to know about 5mm connectors
35345 the typical audio only jack has rings usually call tip ring sleeve trs these typically map to left right and ground phone manufactures wanted to make this jack work with existing headphone so they used connector with rings called tip ring ring sleeve trrs these map to left right and ground just like the ring but the final connector maps to microphone this makes it so that if you plug an audio only cable into it the microphone input gets connected to ground so nothing is hurt it also means that if headset with microphone is connected to an audio only device the microphone is connected to ground also hurting nothing sources what protocol does headphone jack use leads direct jack plugs sockets
35371 update try cleanup and reinstall of drivers as mentioned here seems to have worked for others this seems to be known issue and many have had success by using different cable connecting to usb port etc but clearly those wont work in your case not sure what your usual usage is but for file transfers you can use airdroid which connects through wifi
35414 there are many 2sd methods and they generally involve root access my personal favorite is link2sd it uses symlinks which take up practically no space the actual program data libraries etc are stored on second partition on your sd card this comes with the downside of actually having to create two partitions on your sd card meaning it will have to be formatted if you have root you likely have custom recovery installed that can automatically partition your sd card the upside of multiple partitions is that you can mount your sd card when plugged into computer without causing the apps to disappear from your device this is because only one partition is actually unmounted from android and mounted on the computer and the other partition holding your apps is never unmounted
35415 the easiest way to get around this is to root your device and use an app that forces apps to the sd card droidsail super app2sd limitations of this apps installed on the sd card wont have widgets they will be broken apps will not be loaded until the sd card is mounted some alternatives use the link2sd app to move apps to the second partition of your sd card pros can move libs and dalvik cache which take up loads of memory widgets still work apps mounted during boot cons also needs root needs second partition on your sd card
35503 there is nothing dangerous about it and this is done occasionally when the store isnt accessible in response to your second question apks are not unique and can be easily transferred to another device or the internet this is the base of android app piracy when you upload the apk to google play gplay does nothing to it it is up to the developer to obfuscate the code to prevent decompilation
35533 as liam already pointed out theres no danger involved for the developer if one wants to grab the apk for distribution thats easily possible using apps like appmonster which can back up the apk file to sd card no extra protection from googles side except users might feel more safe installing it from trusted source and they are right about that at least when it comes to unknown new devs as the google bouncer adds protection layer against malware see android and security in fact many developers hold their apps apk files available on their project site for good reasons one you already mentioned in your question playstore might have temporary problems moreover not all devices are able to access the playstore and thus could not use your app if it would be available only there another good reason would be to provide beta versions this way so as dev you can get early feedback without running the risk of negative feedback on the playstore to sum up at least for free apps id even recommend to keep direct download link to the apk available if possible
35581 check the exif data and see if theres timestamp there if there is photo date correction will allow you to overwrite the botched file timestamp with the exif one giving you back your proper sorting
35665 yes the google play store does self update itself as far as know there is no way to disable the auto self updating of the play store application as it is built into the application systems code you might could try freezing it with titanium backup requires root but dont know if that would work since the play store is also integrated into the os the only sure way would be to disable all internet connectivity is there specific reason that you want to disable this feature
35666 according to the section of the google play terms of service you consent to automatic updates updates you may need to install updates to google play or related google software that we introduce from time to time to use google play and to access or download products products originating from google may communicate with google servers from time to time to check for available updates to the products and to the functionality of google play such as bug fixes patches enhanced functions missing plug ins and new versions collectively updates by using the google play store and installing these products you agree to such automatically requested and received updates bolding added for emphasis
35667 this is due to things the file does not have execute permissions and the file cannot gain executable permissions as it is on the sd card the sd cards filesystem can accept file permissions however it is mounted with the noexec flag as stated in comment this stops files being executed solution copy the net snmp directory to the data local tmp directory as root set the configure file to be executable by running chmod data local tmp net snmp configure as root you should now be able to execute the configure script by typing data local tmp net snmp configure and pressing enter note this should all be done as the root user
35671 as explained by the comments and liams answer this is due to the noexec flag used by the system when mounting the sdcard if your configure file is shell script as it usually is you can still trick it to be executed cd to the directory as you described above and then execute sh configure sh is the shell interpreter and that binary should be located in system bin where files are executable passing your script as the first argument this will open new shell process which executes your configure script
35700 as pointed out by als comment above its not question of which browser does support it but rather of how to enable it and as sachins comment suggests available solutions depend on whether your device is rooted more and better possibilities or not non rooted devices as long as its for the browser only there are multiple easy solutions so does http proxy settings give you access to the hidden http proxy settings the android system itself has available for more than browsers asproxy might be choice but its not for free it even provides by pass for local networks so you can decide which addresses are routed via proxy and which can be accessed directly rooted devices first choice obviously is proxydroid highly rated it offers hell of features support http https socks4 socks5 proxy support basic ntlm ntlmv2 authentication methods individual proxy for only one or several apps multiple profiles support bind configuration to wifis ssid mobile network 2g 3g widgets for quickly switching on off proxy low battery and memory consumption written in and compiled as native binary bypass custom ip address dns proxy for guys behind the firewall that disallows to resolve external addresses pac file support only basic support thanks to rhino and another big plus this app is open source and free
35759 well there is menu available for handsets running android os to get the menu go to your stock phone app and type the following it is simply service there are many things you can do in this menu view service information check service settings carryout service tests reset customization settings some of these items may differ from handset to handset these are the typical menu items available this menu comes handy when checking the total call timer in service tests rooting status check in service info configuration etc
35761 go to your phone dialer and enter these codes they work in my samsung galaxy nexus jelly bean testing menu the same as info imei number additionaly check out the page secret codes for android full of codes some of them didnt work in my phone and screenshots note please be extremely careful with the options because theyre not intended to be messing with them
35766 as the how has already been explained you might want to have the what as well there are several lists on the internet just google for secret codes with many of those codes not all of them work on all phones some are device or manufacturer specific but many are common to all android devices and some times even to all smartphones wont list all of them here but few more important to be known include code description gsm infos battery infos puk new pin new pin for confirmation unlock pin test proximity sensor show imei firmware info show your phone number service menu service service menu checkin check for ota updates factory format phonenumber anonymous call ram test info system infos customize powerbutton factory reset use at your own risk some options might prove dangerous the factory format especially if you dont know what they are supposed to mean think twice or better avoid the option
35783 on the galaxy note you can also use the pen press and hold the button on the pen and press it against the screen for few seconds what happens next is screenshot will be taken then you will be able to adjust it before either accepting or discarding the screenshot
35848 there are several ways even in this stage ill try to sum up as many of them as remember find also dont keep it restricted to single device but try to cover as many as possible so it will be helpful to as many readers as possible as you kept the device tag from your question all of them should find it all devices if your credentials are not accepted though they are correct sometimes this part seems to be buggy so this page lists few work arounds amongst others these include try entering null as password together with your google username according to this page it should be the literal term null try entering your username without gmail com combine and try the normal recover password routine from gmail com and start over from all devices bypass screenlock using special app update the app mentioned in this solution is no longer available instead reset screen lock should do the same according to theunlockr the problem should be very easy to resolve go to the web version of google play login with the google account associated with your android device install screen lock bypass unfortunately paid app now reboot your device another source mentioning this is ultratechy com which contains few more explanations according to that the app will circumvent the too many attempts block so you can directly access your device again to make complete backup before resetting it as soon as this app is uninstalled the too many attempts will be in effect again immediately hence they add few more steps go to settings accounts sync under manage accounts remove all accounts except your google account this should enable your google username and password go to settings applications manage applications find screen lock bypass and uninstall the app this will trigger the too many pattern attempts screen immediately use your original google username and password to finally unlock your phone properly enter your new security pattern twice to finish all devices unlock via web if you still know your pattern and it only was your little brother who played with your device and have your google account login password ready ultratechy com offers another approach using your computer log into your google account go to this link directly https accounts google com issuedauthsubtokens or click your mail on the top right corner select account settings then hit visit the previous version of the google accounts screen towards the bottom click authorizing applications sites under your personal settings security under connected sites apps services revoke access of your google account with android you will see the screen showing you have successfully revoked access to full account access alternate for step if you have already signed up for step authorization previously and are able to generate new application specific password at the bottom go ahead and generate new password and use that password to unlock your device enter gmail login and password on your device it will now accept your login details and will show pattern screen enter the correct pattern and you can see the home screen all devices disable pattern lock via adb according to this source theres way to disable the pattern lock via adb few requirements for this though your device probably must be rooted not mentioned there but the database we need to update is owned by system system and nobody else has read or even write access to it also removing files from data system is unlikely to be permitted without usb debugging must be enabled on the device rooted users alternatively you can boot into recovery where usb debugging is not required but you might need to manually mount the data partition the android sdk must be installed on your computer device must be plugged in and connected via usb you need command line on the computer on the command line enter the following adb shell sqlite3 data data com android providers settings databases settings db sqlite update system set value where name lock pattern autolock sqlite exit exit according to comment from kay on android the sql statement should read update secure set value where name lock pattern autolock at least with cm7 on htc desire now disconnect and power off your phone and turn it back on and the pattern lock should be gone according to geeknizer there are few additional useful steps to follow after the reboot use your adb shell again and adb shell rm data system gesture key then reboot again when device reboots you will still see pattern lock screen but here the catch just try any random pattern and it may unlock then remove the pattern from settings hint if the settings app crashes when you try to set new pattern remove all key and locksettings db files from data system see more below some additional notes from this comment by krlmlr mounting data will be necessary this can be done using mount data via adb shell if the sqlite binary is not available on the device you can use adb pull to copy the database file to your computer edit it there using sqliteman and finally use adb push to replace it on the device on his android device the sql command had to be update secure set value where name lockscreen lockedoutpermanently all devices similar thing without adb for those not having usb debug activated on their device there might be work around using flashable zip as described here this procedure requires the zip file to be found at the linked page an editor busybox and root on the device plus the device needs to be rooted extensive procedure too long to be included here and as it is no help without the zip either you have to follow the link for this one phones use hole to disable your lock if it is phone if you can give it voice call you might be able to use security hole as described here call yourself from another phone answer hang up directly after hanging up start pressing your buttons like madman for seconds ending with your home button might take while to get the timing right go into settings and disable pattern lock however guess that might leave you without protection afterwards as you need to verify with the old method before being able to reset it to new but still didnt try it might as well be it ignores the failed attempts at this place phones use hole to create new account for phones theres bad work around according to this post call the device from another phone or have friend calling it answer the call do not hang up use the back key not the home key over and over this should eventually bring you to your home screen go to settings google accounts and add new google account sign in with this new account after it accepts the new account credentials and logs you in hang up the phone and go back to the lock screen now use the new google accounts data to bypass the lock screen via the forgot button samsung users with windows pc theres one click solution to be found at gsmhosting com which claims to be able to solve the issue according to the many thanks the poster received it seems to work you can download the windows executable there connect your phone to your computer and click forensics oh yeah those guys who work for courts police secret services corporate security theyve got ways as well example needed viaforensics viaextract can even decode pattern locks so dont think youre unbreakable though this is only mentioned here for completeness dont think you easily get your hands on that more there might be more alternatives to that if happen to stumble upon them hope remember to update my answer again and here we go if theres google account associated with your device you can use googles device manager to remotely put different lock of course this would need the device connected to the internet some more adb based methods are described here use twrps integrated file manager to delete all key and locksettings files from data system do the same via adb shell root required use any custom recovery to flash password disable zip link is download from xda

36221 if youve just plugged it in to the charger leave it while before you try to turn it on the boot sequence uses power faster than usb can provide it so you will need little juice in the battery in order for it to boot up all the way
36222 some devices dont know about the nexus but think it will be about the same only charge when they have still little charge left on their battery because believe it or not charging happens electronically so it can be that your device has absolutely no juice left to run an example of such device is the blackberry playbook not android where this trick works when your tablet doesnt want to boot but there is simple solution for that which can take some time try to keep your device awake for as long as possible even if that means you have to restart it couple of times of course you do this while your charger is connected after you have restarted it couple of times it should normally boot up expect it will take about or boots for the battery to be charged at minimum level again after that make sure you keep the device connected long enough so the battery is fully charged have look in your user manual how long it is recommended most tablets need about hours another option is that your device just needs little more juice to start in that case you should leave it plugged in for some time recommend at least an hour before booting tl dr two options you could try just keep restarting it after while it will start as normal recharge the battery for long time probably around hours leave it plugged in for long time before restarting

36294 in the realm of the arm chipsets which is the common factor the entire android stack from the near identical kernel based on linux are in fact 32bit cross compiled from usually either 32bit 64bit host environment the host environment is usually one of the distributions of linux recommended distribution by google for building and cross compiling android is ubuntu the android run time library media graphics filesystem to name but few are also 32bit but as we reach the layer of the dalvikvm then the number of bits becomes irrelevant as it is at this point the apks coming from the google play store are native bytecode by product of generated java code compiled into portable bytecode which targets the dalvikvm virtual machine which in turn interprets and translates the bytecode targetting the raw arm instruction set froyo was the last android that enabled compilation under 32bit hosted environment in which it was cross compiled targetting the arm chipset gingerbread was the first of future android back then circa three years ago that introduced requirement to use 64bit hosted environment in which it was built there was many hacks to get gingerbread to be built under 32bit hosted environment ics and jb and upwards now definitely requires 64bit environment to speed up compilation and to reduce turn around time in building so to sum up what you see on the play store has no bearing on whether 32bit or 64bit are used and thus irrelevant side note typical 16gb ram quad core 64bit linux distribution the time it takes to build ics from scratch takes 30minutes maximum had this being 32bit linux distribution it would have taken longer in fact may cause cpu meltdown as there is simply not enough processing power to churn and crank out cross compiled code which is very demanding and taxing process proof of this pull in any native arm binary found in system bin or system xbin for example system bin dalvikvm this is the dalvik vm binary that is responsible for the upper layers of java and apks now examine the binary by issuing this command file dalvikvm which gives summary of the type of file it is the expected output would be this dalvikvm elf bit lsb executable arm version sysv dynamically linked uses shared libs stripped notice the reference to bit elf and is cross compiled to arm and is binary executable right moving on lets inspect native shared library found in system lib for example system lib libandroid runtime so now issue file libandroid runtime so the expected output would be this libandroid runtime so elf bit lsb shared object arm version sysv dynamically linked stripped again notice its bit elf cross compiled to arm and is shared library the key to the hosts cross compilation can be found in the aosp source gingerbread build originally had requirement to be built on 64bit host system heres the newsgroup linky referring to how to patch the scripts to get it to build on 32bit host which has two patches found here for build core mk and build main mk combined on aosps gerrit review as subsequent result this patch had made its way to icss build scripts in which did have the privilege of compiling ics on 32bit platform which took days to build it was port of ics for the zte blade now the requirements are ramped up you do definitely need 64bit host to enable cross compilation of building aosp from ics upwards
36314 since android devices no longer need to have hardware soft buttons for menu back home etc they are now part of the screen provided by the os the menu button has now been replaced by dots in the top corner of the program if these dots on top of each other are not visible then the app hasnt been updated for ics and you will not be able to access the menu items unless you are rooted if you are rooted you can download the button savior app that will overlay buttons onto the screen you can set one to the menu button to then access the apps menu here is screenshot of the button you have to press to access the app menu see the thing in the yellow square
36331 if you can connect using adb usb debugging you can simply use the command reboot if youre rooted and have terminal emulator installed su reboot will do the same thing the reboot command will also accept arguments of recovery or bootloader which will reboot you into the recovery or bootloader respectively
36336 widgets apps which might help also with other phones take look at fast reboot the app claims to work on non rooted devices does not require root trouble is this doesnt perform full reboot but just kills all processes to simulate fast boot guess this includes the system server so it comes very close to reboot another app you could give try is simple reboot it doesnt mention root anywhere in its description but claims to be shortcut to the boot option not tested but it might do for you secret codes service menus almost all real boot solutions seem to require root so it will be hard to find anything suitable but it could be that one of the built in service menus offers an option to reboot the device you can invoke them via your dialer program entering magic number examples would include one of the service menus or info system information this one should work on all phones and for sure gives you useful system information cannot remember if it had reboot option as well but it cannot hurt to know this code miscellaneous service options related to the sim afair and coming from samsung galaxy list heh look at this restarts phone source galaxy secret codes there you go last option should be the easiest one no additional tools needed if it works not having any samsung device cannot test

36401 since the ops question was dated back in mid summer of things have changed bit with maps and has been updated since in agreement with other answerers who have pointed out you can download the maps for offline usage no calculation is needed if using maps what found actually surprised me the gps navigation still works even if off line and not using any 3g wifi either with the maps hit menu tap on make available offline then you can pan and zoom in on the location of the map to increase the size of the map for offline usage it may be required to zoom out if you want big area of maps coverage then the download will happen wifi needed preferably as depending on the size of the offline map it will take while not your conventional nippy download speed furthermore if browsing on desktop pc hit up on maps on the google site and select your starting point and ending point as destination if planning journey and save that as my places with the maps app it can sync up with my places and pull it down and be used with the off line map that surprised me the gps navigation will actually show where you are and the route to take caveat emptor be sure to have plenty of battery juice as the gps is working on it simply enable gps all data switched off and as its oft said lets hit the road jack and profit
36583 there is no documentation but you can find all the information you are looking for in the android source code service list gives you the package name so for the phone service it is com android internal telephony itelephony you will find all possible parameters for service call phone listed in com android internal telephony itelephony java for your android version
36745 you can visit this site from your phones web browser which will show you your screen resolution android version and device id
36768 use vector maps instead of pre downloading or caching rendered map tiles vector maps versus bitmap pre rendered tiled maps heres the difference caching google maps or any other pre rendered maps stores dozens to thousands tiles of bitmap images on your device even though these are compressed they take up gigabytes of storage especially if youre in to storing maps for full country also bitmap images are just that images mapping and especially navigation applications cannot interpret whats displayed on the image so they dont know about the nearest gas station bus stop what river youre on paddling etc vector map is in some special data format to be displayed it has to be rendered which means an image must be calculated out of the raw data first so the biggest drawback is that applications using those might be more cpu intensive however depending on the quality and contained features of the vector map and the quality and features of the application you can query the map for navigation by car by foot by boot by bike you can get info about nearest restaurants or the nearest letterbox another main advantage of vector maps is its much smaller size compared to bitmap data while pre rendered map tile image may contain some greenish and varying pixel data to represent wooded area which is linear proportional to the covered area the same vector map may just say wooded area and store the coordinates of the boundary another advantage thus is that the application decides how to render said wooded area and thus the user has some influence on how she likes maps to look like you might be able to tell your mapping application to switch to red blue black color scheme during the night without having to download second set of bitmap tiles its just recalculated on the fly upon changing some settings and does not take up any additional memory the amount of storage and the available feature set is restricted by the data contained in the vector map so depending on your needs and those of your applications some may want to have the full open street map data while some get by with just basic set also with vector maps and their small amount of storage and their ability to customize their rendering inside applications theres no need to use any additional application on your desktop to prepare the maps download files and off you go while in theory this works in practice the original data files of the openstreetmap project have to be converted into syntactically different format see below coming back to howtos and applications im still beginner on android heres what use today open street map is project to provide full featured vector maps for free like wikipedia the map data can be improved by users and this happens all the time mapsforge vector maps pre assembled vector maps of open street map can be found courtesy of the mapsforge project at http download mapsforge org maps using original open street map files the above mapsforge files can be used as is and are thus the most convenient solution however if youd like to start from the original open street map files you can follow this guide to convert the original files from the pbf format to the map format using osmosis typical command line example would be osmosis read pbf hungary osm pbf mapfile writer file hungary osm map locus as mapping application you can use locus free download and install download any of the vector maps file and store it on your phone in the folder mnt sdcard locus mapsvector themes personally download the maps on my desktop pc store them in folder which share via samba on linux or share on windows machine then use any android filemanager ghost commander with samba plugin es file explorer file manager on my phone to copy the files from the shared location to the android devices locus mapping folder oruxmaps you can also use the oruxmaps app unfortunately have not yet found way to use both applications without having to store the map data twice sd cards do not support symbolic links if youve got the data on internal memory you could use them and store the maps only once you can use again your preferred filemanager on android to copy the map files from the aforementioned locus folder to the folder where oruxmaps stores its map files by default this is mnt sdcard oruxmaps mapfiles switch to the new map click the upper right hand map icon click new map in the pop up menu click offline in the upper right hand side choose any of the map map files note that in oruxmaps you can navigate through subfolders so if you like you can use your filemanager to organize maps in subfolders hint you could fully copy the mapsforge data into your oruxmaps map folder and never worry anymore note also that if you have the oruxmaps app open while you are copying new map files into its data folder then you may have to click on reset map sources in the new map dialogue to ensure it rereads the map folder for new files heres howto on those two applications for theming your maps maps as mentioned before depending on the app you may influence the way the vector maps are rendered this includes color settings as well as which data is to be included in the display and which is not
36853 all arm chips are currently bit because of this android currently executes all code in bit environment bit processors set to launch in
37021 here are the standard vanilla codes that should work across all devices quick grep through the source code revealed these secret dial codes for android show debug info in apps settings start stop voice call debug logging or so in apps voicedialer debug email in apps email in apps protips debug calendar in providers calendarprovider did also check all available google apps from http goo im gapps versions android and google talk googleservicesframework android and jelly bean googleservicesframework googlepartnersetup note this functionality is realized via regular broadcast intents and filters any app that wants to can define their own code and subscribe to those broadcasts also note that the above code are only the visible open sourced part cyanogenmod here and google apps which did unpack and then scan if youre interested in doing it yourself unpack them with apktool and grep through their androidmanifest xml files for this way egrep include xml secret code android host it will find occurences in androidmanifest xml receiver android name checkin checkinservice secretcodereceiver intent filter action android name android provider telephony secret code data android scheme android secret code android host intent filter
37022 there is an app on google play that will inspect the androidmanifest xml files of all the apps installed on your phone for secret code broadcast receivers and then list the codes associated with them the app is called secret codes revealer and you can download it from google play note if you get blank entry in the list it is because the app hasnt hard coded the secret code and allows you to change it
37056 theres an awkward solution renaming the package name inside an apk as proposed by adobe to fix nasty limitation of their air framework xda has the same too all use apktool to reverse engineer an app unpack apk change package name in androidmanifest xml repack resign note this wont change locations on the sd card though if its used all instances would use the very same folder on the card still just fyi
37309 oh found it dropspace allows one to select folder on android and keep it fully synced with any but not the root dropbox folder
37312 to download you need to open the dropbox app and select the file you want to download to upload you need to open the dropbox app and select upload here from the dropbox menu the files you see on the dropbox app are not the actual files they are only links that are in the dropbox server which you must download the dropbox app for android does not work the same way as the dropbox app for the pc the pc version automatically downloads syncs the file on your pc
37368 dropspace has some limitations according to its description on the play store current limitation only files existing on the sdcard are synced that is its not full way sync ive been using dropsync it does sync in both directions and ive had no cause for complaint
37583 for the typical end user the easiest ways probably are if the rogue was installed from google play on computer open the play store website with your favorite web browser log in with your google account credentials hit the my android apps tab at the upper right of the page look for your rogue app hit the trashcan symbol next to it this will uninstall the selected app of course this only works for apps installed via google play if you side loaded the rogue installed it from another source if you side loaded the rogue youll need couple of more steps follow from above list then search for any other homescreen launcher app hit the install button on its page if youve got multiple devices attached to this google account select the one with the rogue app hit ok within the next few minutes the new launcher should be installed on your device until then you might want to periodically switch it on to ensure it stays awake and connected to the network which might speed up the process little once the installation has finished hit the home button as android noticed the new launcher app pop up will ask you to chose which launcher to start select any launcher you want just not the rogue one as you now have fully functional launcher running you can take the usual steps to remove the rogue app
37651 if for any reason it seems impossible to clear the default settings theres simple work around available simply install another app which offers the same service to clear the default launcher setting install another launcher the system will detect that another player is present and thus the user might want to chose again so next time that activity is requested in our example the home button is pressed the familiar pop up will appear again asking to select the app to launch besides an update of an existing app of the same group will trigger this as well in our example if one of the installed launchers is updated the popup will also be triggered next time you hit the home key
37687 there is an application called simple adb backup simple adb backup backs up your android phone from the desktop no root required most android backup tools require root or run from your phone and save your data to your sd card simple adb backup is different the app runs from and backs up your phones data to your desktop and does it all without root to use simple adb backup youll need usb debugging mode enabled on your android device go to settings developer enable developer options then enable usb debugging and the utility installed on your desktop thats about it just plug in your phone launch the app on your windows or linux system and choose backup option you have the option to back up your entire device just apps all data with or without system apps or even single app if you choose the app also lets you restore backed up data to your device before you back up youll be prompted to generate password youll also have to type into the app on your phone before the backup can begin but after that the process runs smoothly its extremely simple completely free and doesnt require you root first whilst titanium backup is more feature filled app if youre willing to root especially if you want bulletproof backup system for your android and mybackup pro is great if youre migrating to new phone and dont want desktop as middleman but simple adb backup is free and apparently so easy to use that even android beginners can easily and quickly back up their important data simple adb backup was released for free over at the xda developer forums hit the link below to download it there http forum xda developers com showthread phpp please note this is new application currently still in beta
37738 koushik dutta aka koush aka mr clockworkmod has published helium backup which should make the entire thing possible even without the need of computer and usb cable helium backup should be able to backup apps and data to sd card attached usb devices dropbox google drive or box this isnt full backup in so far as it comes to system settings but it does restore application settings and data it does not backup your internal storage the user files so youll have to backup those files separately if you find yourself unable to see your backups in the restore list some of the backup metadata may have gotten lost in translation the backup themselves can still be restored but youll need some extra leg work to get them edit for full fledged how to on the usage of helium please see how to backup apps and data without root using helium android app thanks for the hint simon and before complaining on anything make sure youve checked with the helium wiki thanks to golimar for pointing this out
37835 simple answer no this isnt possible long answer toasts are built into apps and are low level there is no way for 3rd party apps to catch toasts and there is no way to view them longer this could be possible if you made your own custom rom however
37879 short answer for security and warranty reasons detailed answer this is mostly precaution taken by most not all device manufacturers to save them from too many service requests from playing kiddies and the sort of people who want to try everything even if they are not understanding anything so those manufacturers took special actions to avoid custom roms or more precisely any roms not provided by themselves to be flashed as t0mm13b already pointed out in his comments above by default you do not get physical access to your devices file system simply by connecting it via usb depending on device android version and some more criteria you get only to see parts this might be the entire sd card physical in ums mode or even only logical access to parts of it via mtp some more privileged access can be gained via adb when enabling usb debug but with stock rom in none of these cases you gain full access now how are updates accomplished then one very common practice is the use of special zip file update zip this is placed on the sd card which is inserted into the device and the device is booted into special mode recovery where the update zip can be applied from but the device checks the integrity of that update zip it must be signed with the manufacturers key for obvious reasons that key is not freely available so no custom rom can be installed this way on such stock system all these things can be circumvented only with super user access to the device which means you must root it so thats for the why part while not handling the how part of rooting exactly as you asked for update for even more details as liam pointed out in his comment that using fastboot would be method to flash custom roms without the pre condition of having the device rooted did little more research to find out about this will continue looking into this but still already wanted to add my first results here up to certain point liam is right with this it seems not only valid to samsung devices as assumed first but some other devices not all also support this method without root being involved aside from the fact that most custom roms will ship rooted of course so you will have root available after installing them however there are devices which seem to require root even for fastboot flash see theunlockr concerning the iconia a100 quote you must have rooted your device before doing this procedure and yes they use fastboot flash recovery recovery img afterwards however even if fastboot works for your unrooted device there is one crucial point to consider to flash rom for your android device with fastboot you must have an unlocked bootloader or an engineering bootloader flashing guide android xda developers which means if your bootloader is locked you need to unlock it first which will wipe factory reset your device so all data will be gone for good this way while with root you could have done complete backup nandroid titanium backup before this step however starting with android this is no longer real problem as you can do full backup via adb see full backup of non rooted devices summary there are devices requiring to be rooted before you can flash custom rom if your device falls into this category the reasons for why is root access required to flash custom rom are those mentioned above however there are also devices which can be flashed using fastboot without being rooted before if your device falls into that category the question why is root access required to flash custom rom becomes invalid the answer not as ex falso quodlibet sequitur from false can follow anything you can draw any conclusion from wrong premise that is if rooting is required the above is why
37880 you generally dont need to root the phone to install the custom rom you have to root the phone to install mechanism to install the custom rom such as custom recovery image some phones have unlockable bootloaders you can flash boot and system img files via the bootloader without the need to root you can also flash custom recovery image using fastboot without being rooted you would need to install custom recovery as the stock recovery checks that the update zip is signed and most custom rom zips are not signed you might need to root to install custom recovery image if your device doesnt support fastboot but generally you dont need to it just comes with the image you install samsung devices have download mode no need to be rooted to use that you just need odin if connect the phone to pc then doesnt that give me access to the entire file system of the device if so then why cant just overwrite the relevant parts of the fs with whatever rom want no it doesnt it gives you read only access so you cant overwrite files in the system directory root can be used to make system read writeable
37924 how it currently can be done during my morning routine reading my rss feeds stumbled on review at droid discussing an app named apefs this app is developed by german students hence its description on the playstore is in german even if you set the language to english but for our non german readers short description here basically apefs is an alternative front end to the google playstore you browse the playstore as you do with the original app and search it the same but when on the results list1 an advanced filter2 comes into play as the second screenshot shows you can select what permissions your wanted app is permitted to have checkbox marked and what permission it should not have checkbox unchecked however while this can be used to filter out apps with unwanted permissions show only apps whitout the internet permission you can not restrict your results to the opposite show only apps with internet permission the app clearly targets at users concerned about their privacy security and according to the review just found it couple of minutes ago so could not test it yet it does very good job edit as its already year ago and the promise on the apefs homepage gtransed to english as their own english version doesnt have that statement in the first paragraph seems not to be fulfilled anytime soon the app is still offline please consider the web based solution from my other answer as an alternative meanwhile
37954 ive double checked other related posts but it looks like no one has mentioned these yet actually you can get the apk files real apk leecher afaik this is an amazing app ive figured out just week ago but the app is almost months old real apk leecher is java written program to fetch the apk files only the free apps from android market you can have an overview at this app on its authors page right away basically the main advantage of this app is it doesnt require any other programs to make it work anatomically it works similar to the chrome extension which other answers suggest when you open the program specifically the first start it asks for your gmail account info your username and password along with your own unique device id which you can manually get using device id app if you dont have it strictly speaking theres no adware malware associated with it googling for apk leecher throws lot of results providing the reviews for the program it just gets the info because it makes the android market believe that this program is phone trying to get free apps thereby violating the terms apk top figured out this site just days ago it is very good in providing apk files also it isnt black market for most of the free apps it gives the info review market link along with its own link and also qr code users can choose whatever they wish the link also provides resuming capability while downloading the files while in case of paid apps it displays the cost and the market link based on my day experience the site is very much useful for me the site developers post new apps atleast per day or newer versions of apps the main advantage here is unlike many other blogs this site uses its own link so that they wont expire whenever they wish
37971 vlc for android is reported to support opus format src
37993 ive found gonemad music player and neutron music player support playback of opus update if gapless playback is an important feature to you try xmms2 or rockbox both are still in the development stages as far as android is concerned but they are both worthy of mention xmms2 is music player server so you will also need to download controller to use it rockbox isnt available via the play store and it can be bit tricky to setup so you will have to do your own homework on this one
38133 whatsapp marks messages that have been delivered from the sender to the whatsapp servers with single tick and messages delivered from the whatsapp servers to the recipient with two ticks after the single tick has appeared the message is already on the server and cant be removed aborted if your data connection is slow unavailable you can cancel the message by deleting it before the tick appears
38152 from onwards its possible to do so in the system settings apps google play store uncheck the box that says show notifications that kills all notifications for the app
38247 apparently some custom roms do not come with any google services and to fix this you need to flash gapps using program such as clock work mod this page has link to download gapps
38277 if you are on android or up you can use the adb backup resp adb restore command even without rooting your device the syntax is adb backup file apk noapk shared noshared all system nosystem packages to do full backup this would mean adb backup apk shared all backup mybackup ab resp adb restore backup mybackup ab to restore the backup on the new device but keep in mind this would mean all or nothing you cannot restore single apps this way so you rather might want to include the package names of the apps to transfer to find those look up the apps on google play youll find the package names in the url id package name your backup command then would look like adb backup apk shared backup mybackup ab com foobar app1 org foobar app2 net foobar app3 restore stays the same as adb restore always restores everything from the backup file no selection of parts available here for list of available adb commands see here
38298 theres no built in functionality for this but there are handful of third party launchers that support locking the desktop off the top of my head know that both apex launcher and adw launcher do for apex simply double tap on an empty space on the home screen and then select lock desktop to prevent icons from being added or removed on adw launcher you should be find lock desktop option in the settings which you can access from the overflow menu in the top right of the app drawer apex also has settings menu there other launchers that have the lock desktop option holo launcher and holo launcher hd lightning launcher
38326 there may be better workaround for this problem but just tried this make sure you have all your contacts on safe place outside your phone create another than your current google account locale phonebook gmail com add it to your phone make it the one that it used for new contacts by default delete the account on google again if you hadnt had any contacts in your normal google account you are done just make sure that your syncing software uses the correct new account if you had contacts in your normal account youll have to transfer them from the normal google account to the special new account somehow used the software my phone explorer mpe to do it but it is tricky first you need to set the folder account used to sync the contacts in the mpe client on the phone to the one still containing the contacts then sync this will get the contacts over to the pc on the pc copy all the contacts to clipboard also make backup with mpe then delete all contacts on the pc select one then press ctrl to select all then delete then sync this will delete the contacts from the normal google account now change the folder account used to sync the contacts in the mpe client on the phone to the new one also change the folder account where new contacts go into to the new account on the pc paste all contacts again into the application then sync again this will create the contacts in the new account now your contacts are stored in google account which keeps your ics jelly bean phone happy but you are certain that the contacts cannot be accidentally synced with google which hopefully keeps you happy why do they make us do such things think whoever wants to keep his data private should be able to do so without using tricks is someone out there able to program new content provider for contacts using local store btw mpe is still able to store the contacts on the phone locally the way it worked before ics when you sync with your pc however the problem is that on the phone you cannot add new contact to this local store it is just not being displayed when you are asked where to store the new contact pitfall occasionally you will see message that there is login problem with the deleted account instead of being angry about that you can be happy because it shows you that you just have successfully prevented data leakage from your phone to google
38364 this isnt possible since viber needs to be running in order to receive calls which are routed via viber if you shut down the background process you cant be reached via viber the exit button just means it closes the ui but keeps listening for calls in the background

38728 capacitive touchscreens found in modern smartphones dont wear out physically because theyre solid state technology behind piece of glass practically the only way to destroy them is to build up goodly amount of static electricity and then touch the screen if youre deliberate about this it might zap the circuitry but its not specific to touchscreens and you can do that with all kinds of electronics resistive touchscreens found in older electronics can wear out because theyre basically made of movable things two layers of transparent conductive material with thin air gap in between them because the screen relies on physical pressure from your fingertip there cant be solid piece of glass in front of it even if the lcd screen behind the touch array probably is made of glass when your finger presses the layers together when you touch this screen you effectively create an electrical short that is used to signal which point on the screen was touched press hard enough and you can damage these layers so that they dont move away from each other again press often enough and youll simply wear out the outermost soft plastic material of the screen this is why its important to use clean stylus and or screen protector
38765 the setting you are looking for is most likely found in settings development might be called developer options know on some roms this option is initially hidden but if its hidden in your case it would be funny how that cpu overlay was activated scroll down bit there and you should find the monitoring section where you probably checked to show cpu load as the screenshots show the settings item is sometimes called development and on other roms here nexus developer options simply check for something similar not sure if some manufacturer decided for third term
38799 the minimum requirements should be something around mhz cpu and ram rom that should be for stock ics rom custom roms on the other side are developed for specific device so their minimum requirements may be different this can be achieved by enhancing the rom to be able to get almost the same features or more depending on the custom rom as the stock ics the downside of custom roms is that not all go as smooth as stock rom since many of them have several core items modified and under certain circumstances they might fail or dont response in good manner if your phone is rooted and you have custom recovery would suggest you do nandroid backup to save the state of the phone as it is right now and give it try to custom rom if you find the custom rom doesnt meet your expectations you can restore the nandroid backup and recover your previous phone rom for those who arent familiar with nandroid backup it creates an image of the entire phone like norton ghost or clonezilla so if you mess something up you can recover your phone from that image
38815 as peter mentioned the requirements given might apply to stock rom things may look different with special custom roms take the htc wildfire which comes with just 576mhz single core cpu and 384mb ram see gsm arena for full specs and thus wouldnt meet the minimum requirements but put paranoid rom on it which runs and its reported to run even smoother than before no big deal after kicking htc sense guess so it very much depends on multiple factors how close does the device come to the minimum requirements and how well was the custom rom optimized id say with your specs that close even slightly above to the mentioned htc wildfire buzz chances are good very good indeed head over to xda read the topic and grab your copy of paranoid android for the optimus one p500 android paranoidandroid v2 fully source compiled

39140 its not that jelly bean wont support flash adobe decided not to support flash for newer devices starting from jelly bean and onwards dont know the know the reason though maybe they got tired of testing and certifying several devices source you can still install flash on jelly bean there are workarounds for that
39141 adobe decided to stop support for its flash player on android mainly because of html5 doesnt need flash player to play videos unfortunately that didnt mean all web sites you visit would start using html5 instead of flash though it would have been nice if some of the web sites you want to look at are using flash the last version of adobe flash player that landed on the google play store will work with your jelly bean device however since its no longer available through the play store youll need to install it from side loaded apk theyve only stopped support doesnt mean that it wont work but if it doesnt on certain devices then they wont fix it or support it you can still install it from here
39232 as far as know theres nothing built into the os for that guess it depends completely on the developers of the app youre using ive seen some apps where once you start scrolling handle appears on the side of the screen that you can tap and drag to scroll faster ive even seen an app or two where you could touch the top of the screen to immediately scroll to the top of whatever multi screen thing youre looking at but its certainly not universal
39478 had same problem and endlessly researched and did everything except hard reset then when testing the usb cable on another phone realized that wasnt using the usb cable that came with my galaxy s3 i9300 once plugged in the stock usb cable my phone was instantly recognized why this is dont know as the cable had been using works on all other devices tested it even charged my galaxy s3 i9300 perhaps you could be using your wifes usb cable on your phone to avoid frustration and countless hours of testing resetting and reinstalling would recommend to everyone to first make sure you are using the usb cable that came with your phone instead of generic one or one from different model galaxy s3 hope it works for you good luck
39504 you might want to take look at mail myself selfmail which integrate into the share menu or email me email to self create homescreen shortcuts which use preselected email address and or label by long pressing on blank space on your homescreen then select shortcuts then email to self guess thats what youre looking for

39549 this does not necessarily mean your phone is dead your phone will flash the red led light briefly when the battery is completely drained when got this left the phone in the charger for while and eventually the white charging battery icon appeared again upon turning on the device it had battery it was in fact so drained that it died while on the charger at so left it to charge for longer after it regained of its battery took it to work and it seems to be draining charging and working normally im not sure why lots of sites claim this means your phone is dead lots of them just say what else would blinking red light mean but definitely leave your phone plugged in for while and attempt to turn it on again before you attempt to get your phone repaired also if normal microusb doesnt seem to be working try the original charger wall wart that came with your nexus my dad had this issue with the n4 and other chargers didnt seem to work not sure if the volt amp something just isnt enough from other cables or what but google recommended it and it seemed to work
39650 if you dont install the google apps package the first time you wont have access to anything that relies on googles services framework this means things like google play google talk google maps the gmail application etc wont function on your device because they will lack the libraries needed to run you do not need to re install the google apps package every time you update cyanogenmod it will essentially back up your current ones and then re install them during the flashing process simply flash the updated rom however you normally would
39887 say no and have two reasons for that always read the required permissions before installing any application and ensure that this application needs these permissions for its function and not just asks to do some crap on your phone do not allow any application to take permission to tamper with your phone information installing an anti virus app will slow down your phone so better scan for viruses from your pc

40066 another way is to simply go to settings about phone where you should see depending on your cyanogenmod version an item cyanogenmod updates and with all cm versions cyanogenmod version
40464 adb pull doesnt seem to provide flag to pull selected files as workaround you can do this use adb shell unix shell command to copy selected files to temporary location and then pull all files from that location update you can use cp source destination unix shell command to copy only modified files on subsequent run you can also use flag to use it on subdirectories recursive if its required
40886 this question and answer is basically duplicate of https stackoverflow com see the above link for an example program and more in depth discussion as far as know there are two ways to get the usb permission box popup request permission explicitly from your application using usbmanager requestpermission register an intent filter on your accessory and let the system ask for permission when the device is attached in the case of have found that the checkbox on the popup to remember the permission has no effect for me removed all code related to permissions from my software and simply put the intent filter in my manifest when the usb device is plugged in if it hasnt already been granted permission then the usb permission box will popup if the user clicks ok without checking the remember box then the box will popup again the next time the device is connected however if the user checks the box and presses ok then the box should never display again unless the software is uninstalled and then reinstalled im not sure if there is bug somewhere related to your device showing up as dev bus usb and then etc let me know if you are using the intent filter as without that the remember checkbox will do nothing do not know of any way that you can avoid the permission popup altogether suspect there is no way to do it without digging into the android code like you said

41090 further to my comment had look into the underlying android code have possible answer but with no less than four major caveats and obstacles havent tried it because dont have any suitable usb devices to hand you need new permission the permission requires that you are system app the code requires access to something not in the public api forget about this if deploying ordinary after market apps the first prerequisite is that you have the manage usb permission that is described here however in turn the prerequisites for that are that you sign with the system key and you install your app into system app anyway if youre ok with that heres some code ibinder servicemanager getserviceusb service iusbmanager service iusbmanager stub asinterfaceb service grantdevicepermissionmdevice uid mdevice is the device from before uid is your own apps uid and you can look that up an example of how to do that is the first answer here all good no servicemanager is android os servicemanager and thus isnt public api that in this example is your way to getting your hands on the iusbmanager service there may be other routes now getting around that is beyond the scope of my answer in the old days you could use reflection but dont know if you still can after all of those shenanigans it looks like you dont need to request permission any more and if you do it will return immediately with no dialog
41223 please clarify what is the intended goal and why android phones have their own boot loaders and cannot be overridden by other means it is not like pcs bios where you can switch the ordering of boot to boot from certain devices such as network pxe usb primary secondary edit after the comments below and in relation to the ops question is there any way to boot an android phone one with usb otg functionality via way of bus powered usb drive the generic boot loader which resides on the chip set has no knowledge of usb etc as the lk little kernel is more concerned about trapping keystrokes in order to chain load into recovery or to boot directly into android environment when holding vol down key in this instance in pseudo code this is from the context aspect of lk and also the memory addresses pertaining to how to read the partitions are hard coded into this lk so it will know how to process the logic the lk kernel is the de facto standard by qualcomm for msm chipsets snapdragon and adopted by manufacturers such as sony motorola lg samsung and can be found in the aosp source under bootable bootloader if is volume down key pressed then chain load kernel from recovery partition into particular address in memory and jump to it and start execution in bringing up the recovery environment else chain load kernel from system partition into particular address in memory and jump to it and start execution in bringing up the android environment end if as the kernel within lk is pretty limited considering that the binary image of the kernel is burned into the chip and therefore no way of modifying it and also should be mentioned that lk contains the fastboot protocol in preparation for flashing boot recovery system and data partitions there are two sequences to boot primary boot and secondary boot as it is primary boot lk depending on outcome of logic go into secondary boot boot or recovery side note samsung is fond of the pbl sbl which is primary boot loader and secondary boot loader respectively in their jargon when it comes to modding thing about samsung is that in some handsets pbl and sbl may be encrypted samsung wave gt s8500 is one such example where porting android to it was nearly impossible to do because of the drm within the boot loaders which was nightmare to deal with and made modding it extremely difficult nonetheless it is sort of working via an exploit in the fota code this is why there are no extra facilities such as otg functionality or anything else such as serial communications reading from sdcard graphics etc as it would make the lk kernel bigger than is intended in other words it is the smallest possible size of kernel that is designated to do just the above pseudo code happen also another way of looking at it is this and this is dependent on the android version the usb otg functionality is fully brought up within the android environment when the familiar home screen appears then otgs functionality is enabled unfortunately not the case when looking at it from lks perspective if youre curious heres the qualcomm entry on the above lk which is part of the tiny source that has arm assembly included and found in jellybeans aosp source in bootable bootloader legacy usbloader main int boot linux from flashvoid boot img hdr hdr void raw header unsigned ptentry unsigned offset const char cmdline ifp flash find ptn boot cprintf no boot partition return ifflash readp offset raw header cprintf cannot read boot image header return offset ifmemcmphdr magic boot magic boot magic size cprintf invalid boot image header return hdr kernel size flash page size flash page size ifflash readp offset void hdr kernel addr cprintf cannot read kernel image return offset hdr ramdisk size flash page size flash page size ifflash readp offset void hdr ramdisk addr cprintf cannot read ramdisk image return offset dprintf nkernel bytes hdr kernel addr hdr kernel size dprintf ramdisk bytes hdr ramdisk addr hdr ramdisk size ifhdr cmdline cmdline char hdr cmdline else cmdline board cmdline ifcmdline cmdline mem 50m console null cprintf cmdline cmdline cprintf nbooting linux create atagsaddr tags cmdline hdr ramdisk addr hdr ramdisk size boot linuxhdr kernel addr return

41617 you might also want to take look at owncloud it comes with its own android app quoting wikipedia owncloud is software suite that provides location independent storage area for data cloud storage the project was launched in january by kde developer frank karlitschek to create free software alternative to commercial cloud providers in contrast to commercial storage services owncloud can be installed on private server at no additional cost which means you can run it on your own hardware but there are also some providers offering this service or you could have your owncloud hosted with provider of your own choice owncloud is under permanent development so listing its features here would not be wise as things might change if all three links provided go dead the service will probably as well so as long as this is not the case please refer to those links for closer information
41795 here is the solution login into gmail locate account under the sign out name this takes you to my account where you click on security here you find section for application specific passwords at the end of the webpage the issue is explained that some applications that work outside browser arent yet compatible with step verification and cannot ask for verification codes for example email programs including outlook apple mail or thunderbird older android smartphones the root cause of this problem is that you probably turned on the steps verification without noticing this so all you have to do is to generate your application specific password and that is it
41894 as mentioned in comments also have nexus and it daydreams ok when charging usb to wall charger when set to sleep after seconds daydreaming is triggered when the device goes to sleep or when sleep mode would normally be triggered it would seem that if the stay awake option is checked in developer options then sleep mode is never triggered and the device never daydreams so the solution is to uncheck the stay awake option daydream is like conditional stay awake option the screen does not switch off and for this reason device can only be set to daydream when it is connected to power source

42082 there exist versions of osmand the market free version full featured the market plus version full featured used as way to donate to the developers as incentive to keep on improving the droid version source compiled free software version by fdroid with almost no changes to the normal version not so frequent app updates the maps are updated the same way as in the offical build do not under any circumstances install two versions at the same time it will seriously destroy both of the apps the map files on sd your sanity and your battery power
42133 each dalvikvm process runs under sand boxed environment owned by the user id uid of the application running it should be noted that upon installation of the application the uid is allocated and assigned to each installed application the net result is that each running application cannot trample anothers process due to the different uid assigned that grants the protection for the running apps another way of looking at it is this had there being one common uid for all applications then malicious application can really cause havoc be peering into ones settings override intercept another applications running code and do all sorts of bad thingstm to that application
42218 so the same thing happened with me today friend fiddled with my pattern lock too many attempts asked me to enter my google account and password but it didnt work even though remembered it correctly tried all permutations and combinations and possible passwords read multiple blogs to find solution and to avoid factory reset what finally worked was very bizarre keep clicking on the sign in button without entering anything then enter something random and keep clicking then enter your username without gmail and your password if you get lucky itll ask for new pattern and your phone will be normal however this happened after it got locked and after tried everything so presing buttons like madman is the only shot also download screen lock bypass pro for next time
42391 the mediaserver process scans your device for media files to add to your library however the perhaps some more gapps version is broken and gets stuck in an infinite loop on unfamiliar files on your phone this directly translates to battery drain and is bad for the lifetime of your battery and other phone components when running your phone for the first time or when starting media applications the mediaserver is invoked and will commence the horror how to fix reboot phone and do not start media application put nomedia file on your sd card root to prevent library search thus preventing mediaserver from getting stuck this means no media library wait for the glorious google to fix this anomaly downgrade your android firmware gapps to version which lacks this bug use an iphone windows phone modify the gapps mediaserver apk to support all kinds of files normally advanced time consuming
42475 in fact it is not necessary to install the entire sdk if one does not want to use it for development to be able to run basic adb commands in the context needed by an average user rudimentary installation is completely sufficient will try to explain how to do this and hopefully cover the most used computer systems requirements first you will need the basic binaries these can be found in the download area of my android site where try to keep up to date versions available for linux macos and windows windows users if your computer is running windows you will also need the special drivers for your device no generic solution here so you need to check this out yourself usually those drivers are offered for download on the manufacturers website linux and mac os users linux and mac os users might need to make their device known to their operating system for linux you find the necessary steps described in my answers here and here not being familiar with mac os can not speak for it installation linux for linux this is quite easy simply unpack the downloaded binaries into directory of your choice at the time im writing this this will only be two files adb and aapt the latter being used by qtadb and not necessarily needed to execute adb commands directly adjust their file permissions to make them executable from the command line chmod adb aapt finally its good idea to include the chosen directory with your path variable so you can call adb from wherever you are good place for that is at the end of your profile file to include an additional line like export path bin path if you extracted the binaries to bin windows the windows download holds couple more files also extract them into directory of your choice if you want them to be callable from wherever you are without preceding the complete path you need to add that path to your environment variables as well not being windows user must leave the how to do this to you what else you should be done at this point and can use the full powers of the adb command line alternatives on some linux distros you can install the packages android tools adb and android tools fastboot via the resp package manager this has the pro of being updated automatically on os you can use simmacs installer update google now offers direct links for the always latest platform tools which include adb and fastboot platform tools for linux platform tools for mac platform tools for windows further readings everything about adb reference for everyone at xda developers adb for dummies again available via xda developers if you miss the guides as did firstly the first article is consisting of links only colorful as they might look android adb quick guide our adb tag wiki also see alex answer for more alternative sources my sources are the official google downloads just stripped down
42484 do not really understand why anyone would prefer downloading an old version of unknown origin from malware ridden website to downloading the latest official version directly from google itself guess to each its own here are the links to the google repository the latest version of the platform tools contains just few binaries less than 10mb in size each windows linux mac for users of ubuntu and debian distributions personally use have put together small bash script which finds and installs the latest version of the platform tools installing android platform tools adb on ubuntu
42517 in android every application runs as separate user in the linux kernel each process is owned by single user therefore it is not possible to run multiple dalvik applications on single linux process the overhead of running multiple dalvik vm instance is lightweight because linux fork system call is copy on write write to shared cow page will cause page fault and that page will be copied so even though most of the vms memory region in the ram is shared there are no shared state between vms forking processes provides only state isolation but not privilege isolation dalvik vm should not be considered security boundary that is because the vm cannot enforce security boundary the vm is running on user mode the same mode as the program its executing which means bug in the vm might allow the application to modify vm state in way that is not intended the kernel however runs in privileged mode and can enforce security boundary

42584 there is no stock option to do this heres what do and it works pretty good but isnt perfect download reduce photo size from the play store when composing an email click add attachment choice of locations will pop up choose reduce photo size then choose either select image or take photo if you click select image then choose gallery once you have selected the photo you want to send click reduce now confusing window will pop up and this is where it gets little tricky you really have to know picture sizes as measured in pixels click custom the smallest photo size will be shown as default 320x240 or something usually use 640x480 for small 25kb pic but you could resize up to anything you want hit ok and then choose the three dots for the menu and choose done thats it

42629 the following is by far no answer to the question but might shed some light on some details some pieces extracted from the backup api though the api is mainly targeted at developers there are few facts we might be able to extract for our case in the following list italics mark quotes from the api documentation android automatically performs restore operation when your application is installed and there exists backup data associated with the user this can mean two things if an app supports the google backup api and the user has the google backup enabled available backup data will automatically be restored on installation good thing when you install an app used on single device to second device for the first time backups are only associated with the google account not with the device and there exists backup data associated with the user or the other fact was just ignored as irrelevant for this special case app is installed the backup transport is the client side component of androids backup framework which is customizable by the device manufacturer and service provider the backup transport may differ from device to device this might explain the unreliability when it comes to different devices or different android versions emphasis mine data backup is not guaranteed to be available on all android powered devices no comment google provides backup transport with android backup service for most android powered devices running android or greater here we have the minumum android version required for google backup being available at all froyo aka android to get your backup service key register for android backup service each app must have its own key theres no why described but good guess to isolate the backups so no app can read backups of another app wrong key as for backups of another user wrong account while developing your application you can initiate an immediate backup operation from the backup manager with the bmgr tool looks like theres way to manually trigger backups lets dig into that later when its time to restore your application data the backup manager calls your backup agents onrestore method this again underlines the first item of this list first the app must be installed then their own implementations are used to restore its data on second look if the app restore fails there wont be data restore for the failed apps until you manually install them via google play then as the first item showed data should automatically be restored via google backup under the explained conditions must have been backed up with it same account etc backing up other files forgive me not quoting from the technical contents of that chapter but in short only files from internal storage can be backed up according to it some pieces extracted from the bmgr api it provides commands to induce backup and restore operations looks like heres way how to trigger actions manually if the automatism fails these commands are accessed via the adb shell this does not need any explanation adb shell bmgr backup package ok so this action is bound to apps guess if you know the data providers package name this should work as well com android providers settings for the system settings or com android providers telephony for sms mms etc you can force all pending backup operations to run immediately by using the bmgr run command the first command just schedules backups having triggered all packages this can be used to immediately execute them adb shell bmgr restore package this looks to nice to be true right exactly because the backup manager will immediately instantiate the applications backup agent and invoke it for restore data only as the app already needs to be there as its routines are called so in short bmgr can be used to trigger backups for apps supporting google backup which you have installed and it can trigger data restore for the same it can not be used to trigger complete restore at least thats not documented here

42798 looks to be bad recognition by googles code happens on mine as well and no setting can change it google is surprisingly receptive to feedback on its apps bug fix reported made it into google musics update so two ways to get this fixed go to keeps page and click email developer and write this up or within keep menu send feedback
42932 this is question which really trouble me lot when come across with devices which only have mtp but not the mass storage mode also have concerns about it with exactly the same reasons with mahn after some testing have find temp solution which maybe able to preserve the timestamp it makes use of the excternal sdcard otg card reader and also the cp command with the timestamp will be able to preserve but the requirement is the phone need to be rooted first copy the data to sdcard read it with memory card slot otg card reader use adb shell and acquire root permission su cp the data from card to internal memory
42959 once bought always yours new device factory reset does not matter as long as your account stays the same paid apps are bound to the google account youve purchased them with to give some proof use several apps bought once on devices simultaneously never was asked to pay again when installing them on the next device provided used the same account of course
42968 before doing factory reset you can backup your phone settings to the cloud by going to settings backup reset and checking the box that says backup my data once done you can reset your phone and when you set it up again with your gmail id it was backed up with the settings and apps everything will be restored wifi aps as well
43150 the easiest way is using tool like os monitor which shows you amongst others also lot of network details os monitor showing network interface details source google play click image to enlarge as the screenshot shows this app reveals for each network interface interface name ipv4 ip address assigned if this interface is currently unused ipv6 address if available mac address packet statistics transfered data status interface names might be handled differently on different devices but in most cases you can tell from the ip where it belongs to furthermore rmnet is mostly used for gprs mobile data while wifi uses names like tiwlan or eth
43350 just saw it it was simple case of discharged to fix it use the power socket charger and not the usb charger from your laptop or desktop the red light first goes down then it will blink and then the white charging icon comes let it charge at least minutes after that before you switch it on otherwise it would shutdown again but wont go to red light mode in most cases the red light is not the light of death
43369 you dont need to sign into google but without access to the play store you do limit the apps you can install on your phone many apps are available in alternative stores like amazon but dont think they have all of them when you first start up the phone it should ask you for your existing google or to create new one there should be skip option there if you do still want the benefits of play store then you can sign into an account and limit things as you have plans to do what other information does android send to google by default android itself will send anonymous data such as android version device carrier and country to google for usage statistics am not positive if this is sent through play store usage or if there is some code in the phone that does this if it is the latter there is no way to disable it what actions should take to minimise data collection from google and other apps ill be using stock android on nexus limiting your use of google apps will certainly be the biggest way to minimize data going to google for other apps pay attention to the permissions that apps ask for when you install them if you arent happy with the permissions many times the developer will explain the reason for the permissions needed read phone state and identity is used to make sure the phone isnt in call get location may be used for localized ads in free apps if you still arent happy dont install the app and try to find an alternative also if you do decide to use google account for access to the play store keep in mind that certain apps services are already set to sync with google to disable syncing for those apps services go to settings google your username under this menu will show all apps and services that will sync with google uncheck any you dont want synced keep in mind any that are not synced will not be recoverable if your phone goes belly up without backup like your contacts so if you choose not to sync those would make regular backups of any important data google also features an account backup which can sync certain android settings like your wifi networks and bluetooth pairings and can restore those when phone is wiped this should be one of the settings when you do the initial setup of your device but if not or you want to check you can verify what it is set to at settings backup and reset back up my data automatic restore if you are rooted there are apps mods you can install that can allow you to limit specific permissions for each and every app permissions denied lbe privacy guard pdroid etc each app mod has its own requirements limitations check them out to find out which one will work best for you and what you are currently running on your phone while this can help alleviate concerns about what apps can access it can also cause unexpected issues with those apps if they do require permission that was revoked it can take some testing to get things where you want them is android still good choice if dont plan to use googles services while running without google does remove some of the benefits functionality of running an android device it doesnt remove all fo them you still get easily customized os that allows pretty much every default app to be replaced with an alternative 3rd party app dont like the dialer replace it dont like the text messaging app cool check out couple of the big 3rd party ones and see which one you like am definitely fan of android even without googles presence in the os although personally wouldnt want to run it without my google accounts linked but it is still certainly feasible am not familiar enough with the privacy practices of other oss but cant imagine they would be much better than googles privacy practices are probably quite similar between all the major mobile oss android may be bit more singled out due to the tie in with all of googles services but that ends up only becoming concern if you decide to use those services android does allow you to sideload apps install apps from outside the play store by enabling checkmark in the settings it will pop up the first time you try and do it and ask you to enable it know that can only be accomplished on ios after you jailbreak it not sure about other oss another thing to consider especially since you will be using nexus is to look into custom roms many roms will not include any of the proprietary google apps like play store and gmail and only allow you access to it after you flash gapps package google apps this removes everything google related from android except for maybe that anonymous usage statistics mentioned above run cyanogenmod on my nexus albeit with the gapps package and it runs great and adds additional features on top of what stock android includes see lot of people on the cm forums running cm without googles proprietary stuff included
43390 android is facc android might be many things but certainly not privacy first at least not if you want to use google playstore as ressource for your apps while at creation initialization of your google account on your android device you are asked do you want to store your data with google this only means backups of your apps and their data as far as they support it soon you will discover that your contacts and calendars are automatically synced with google servers without asking you unless you explicitly opted out of that so if there are any firsts its facc android comes free of charge is ad supported cloud based and highly customizable nobody will argue the first and last items are very appreciable while the cloud is fine with most and the ads are mostly accepted as long as they are not too agressive like airpush so what data do google services collect nick checked some sources namely googles privacy policy and reported in below comment google says it logs your phone number calling party number forwarding numbers time and date of calls duration of calls sms routing information and types of calls in their privacy policy it also logs your ip address but it doesnt say if this info is logged for android users specifically or if its only collected from other services such as google voice and it doesnt say whether it logs data even if youre logged out of android services sometimes whats missing speaks as well sometimes even louder than the facts mentioned so starting with the worst case scenario we wont be too much shocked later on having created google account or not as soon as network connection is available data can be uploaded to any servers system apps can access identifying data such as imei or imsi your phone number or even your locally stored contacts and calendars yepp paranoia mode enabled again and with an available network they could transfer all data they have available anywhere careful did not say they do so just they could we may collect device specific information such as your hardware model operating system version unique device identifiers and mobile network information including phone number google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your google account source google collection see below never forget while android itself is open source many apps are not but also keep in mind this is not just the case with android but with any other system as well if you want to read some more on googles privacy new google privacy policy explained google in the privacy hot seat again google collection what is collected an excerpt of the privacy policy the truth about android security theres one really scary part we may collect and store information including personal information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage including html and application data caches emphasis mine source google collection see above first steps for privacy at the very first you could check in advance how the device you want to buy comes configured in most cases there will be lot of bloatware pre installed which contributes to the data share while you cannot really be forced to use those apps it sometimes is not really possible to get rid of them without rooting so the less bloatware there is the better rooting is not always an option as in most countries this will void your warranty otherwise you could decide for more privacy friendly custom rom so when youve got your new device you will have to carefully check all options whether they might be intrusive to your privacy say no to above mentioned backup to google question otherwise next to the list of apps youve installed from google play which google knows anyway and data from several apps also sensitive information like your wifi passwords find their way into the cloud before you enter any contact or calendar data make sure to have the sync disabled for them see settings accounts sync you can still export your contact list easily direct from within the contacts app but if you are going to import anything again after factory reset or on new device make sure to check the sync options before that that was how google got my data when forgot that one time if you enable googles location service this will also send anonymized data about places youve been placed anonymized in quotation marks as study recently showed that de anonymization can be easily achieved so you might want to turn that off as well android without google wouldnt it be more consequent then to use android without google this question has been discussed more than once and yes it is certainly possible and before you say its contradiction in terms could split hairs and argue that android is not developed by google but by the aosp the android open source project you will have to sacrifice some things as big part of the apps on google play are hard to find outside google play for example but if thats price you are willing to pay to protect your privacy at max here are some readings for you can an android phone run without google guide how to use your android phone without google android without google discussion xda developers xda developers are also working on pendant to google apps the project is called nogapps privacy with android and google okay the above approach might be bit too exaggerated for the most but hey only because we are paranoid that doesnt mean nobodys after us right so whats the way in the middle mean aside the first steps mentioned above there are many things in first steps for privacy already described how to prepare fresh unbloated android that comes with the google apps now lets look what to care for next pre installed apps there might come some pre installed apps not belonging to the android core system and not really needed for the privacy concerned stuff like google or facebook starting with android we can simply go to settings apps manage apps and disable those we dont want to use this also might give boost to performance and improve battery life as it rids us of several background services those apps were running at startup even if we never started them installing new apps dont click on everything fancy well need to remember that for later part ads in apps of course look around what sounds useful or interesting to you but make sure to read through the comments at least scan through them for possible obstacles ignore those one word comments like great and shit and also those just declaring download problems and the like they do not speak about the app but check if there were any privacy concerns in the past or any other trouble for that sake then make sure to check the permissions the app requests do they make sense in the context of what the app is supposed to do critical combinations for privacy are access to personal data contacts calendars etc with internet or simply internet as they could send anything how hard you argue depends on the grade of paranoia you cultivate privacy helpers sometimes its not avoidable to risk some permissions of course web browser needs internet access as does sms app need access to your messages so how to control or restrict them there are several helpers around see this list at lisisoft will take you while to scan through it you can hide sensitive information using password stores locked galleries crypt containers see droid crypt all these things do not even require your device to be rooted but really forbidding apps to access things or control their access wont work without root examples have already be named in bassmadrigals answer lbe privacy guard controls access to your data call logs contacts etc to critical functions initiate calls access location data etc plus firewall your device control which apps might access the net via wifi mobile data careful when youre running jellybean or higher the playstore version of this app is known to cause boot loops there rather check xda developers they have fixed version pdroid comes in several variants pdroid privacy protection being the original one followed up by pdroid manager and openpdroid other than lbe these cannot be installed as an app but need additional preparations as they are deeply integrated into the system this not only adds another layer of protection but openpdroid is even opensource which adds another layer of trust as well see also how to fake my personal information want some shocking details visit your google dashboard log in with your google account here you can find out whom you contacted most frequently and what other data google collected from you what happens with all your data when you die or for any other reason become inactive ooops yes also something one should keep in mind in this context plan your digital afterlife the linked article introduces the new inactive account manager you can tell us what to do with your gmail messages and data from several other google services if your account becomes inactive for any reason for example you can choose to have your data deleted after three six nine or months of inactivity or you can select trusted contacts to receive data read more in the linked article protect your device now youve taken care no data is leaving your device even locked data away in data vaults and secured the back doors you should not leave the front door wide open go to settings security and set up screen lock multiple choices here the good old pin code not really secure at least not if you use king rolands pin for druidias planet shield or president screws for his briefcase in case you do not know spaceballs the pin was for both also not your birthdate or something like that pattern lock more secure as relation to data retrievable by social engineering is quite unlikely password can be highly secure if you use all characters available letters upper and lower case numbers special chars and make it long ti1 spnc3h how to remember that check this is uper secure password nobody can 3asily hack anti theft protection also lot of solutions on the playstore highly praised solutions include cerberus anti theft avast mobile security and more if your device gets lost with good anti theft protection you can check its position sound an alarm remotely back up retrieve stored data before you remote wipe the entire device including its sensitive data and optimally the anti theft app automatically informs you in case the thief changes the sim it hides itself stealth mode and with root available can even protect itself against factory reset by integrating into the system partition so the only chance thief has is to immediately switch off the device put it into faraday cage and flash new rom while its still in there anti virus you can left out if youve followed above steps yes there certainly is malware around but with all the protection levels taken and careful selection of sources as well as the apps themselves risk is absolutely minimal never had malware on any of my devices though ive tested lot of apps over the past years after all anti virus or rather anti malware as yet there was no virus sighted for android might give false sense of security what shall happen ive got that anti virus as they cannot really detect everything no heuristics but rather check against database of known malware mainly backup last but not least having turned off all google services or at least restricted them to minimum you will need an alternative backup to be honest even if youve decided to answer yes to the above question of do you want to backup your data with google you will need good backup as that google backup might be many things but for sure not complete apps must explicitly support it by implementing its api which is done by few apps for this if your device is rooted strongly recommend little investion do yourself and your device some good and buy titanium backup pro you wont regret it tibu is very powerful tool to backup and restore apps including their data restore parts of nandroid backups see nandroid tag wiki and backup tag wiki for details freeze unfreeze apps detach apps from the playstore and much more scheduled backups included stored to your sdcard or if you really want to to the cloud not being rooted but having device with android or higher take look at carbon app sync and backup so you can at least backup all your apps and their data plus some of the system data scheduled backups are planned here as well additionally you might want to take look at full backup of non rooted devices for more details on this topic conclusion as wrote there usually isnt simple answer you can use android without google cut down all network connections and so on but at latest when you also take out your sim its no longer smartphone android is designed to be network enabled from its very beginning you could say who cares and let it all go and complain when its too late usually you have to find way in the middle deciding how much of your privacy you are willing to sacrifice for how much comfort convenience just listed possibilities showed what is to be found where and what solutions exist to protect your privacy the one way or the other hopefully my elaborations will help you making your decisions
43402 just copied my apk file into the apps folder which is created by default in the libraries folder at the time of bluestacks installation then just double clicked on the apk file to install it to the app player now can see the application icon on the home screen of the app player and am able to run it from there
43414 to my knowledge twrp does nandroid backup as you can read in the tag wikis of the mentioned tags nandroid backup nandroid backup takes images of your partitions its not backup on the file level but on partition level so it includes everything stored on those partitions doing full nandroid backup of your system thus includes the entire system one file per partition there are only very few things not contained such as the radio firmware so to put it as short direct answer to your question yes full nandroid backup would include all your apps app data messages contacts though it might be complicated to extract them separately nandroid cant do that its always an all or nothing but titanium backup can read data from nandroid backups just in case youll need that
43448 os monitor lists network connections by app os monitor and connection tracker listing connections source google play click image to enlarge as you can see os monitor lists up all connections and lists the corresponding app owning this connection along this should enable you to see all servers your suspicious app connects to there are other apps available with the same feature as well as connection tracker shown in the second screenshot if you really need the full url the above wont bring you there both apps use methods similar to netstat which only reveals the hosts instead you might want to take look at tpacketcapture which sniffs your network traffic without requiring root and saves the protocol in so called pcap files these again can be read then by shark reader
43450 currently there is no way to share notes on keep in the same way that you can share document however if your goal is to share notes between fixed amount of persons family members you can always create new google account add it to all android phones that you need to share on and enable sync of keep only on that account
43464 there are likely two calendar apps on your system stock android includes an app and google provides one as well which might be preinstalled on your device or you may have downloaded it without realizing it they both look very similar which is probably why you thought they were the same when you held on them for the app info screen check in your app drawer the stock android calendar is green calendar icon and the google one is blue then disable notifications for one of them you can always click on the roll up notifications and when that app opens go into the settings and disable notifications then go to your app drawer and check both icons both are labeled calendar see which app has notifications disabled once you determine what app it is if it is the google calendar you could just uninstall it or if it is the built in one you can disable it via settings apps all calendar disable
43477 can confirm that this is normal behaviour for the default blue google calendar on the nexus just the app having tried few tests of my own the multiple roll up events appear to be events for which you have already received notification but have not explicitly acknowledged or dismissed it in which case the notification remains in the notification area and forms this group when the next notification occurs in the screenshot above notification has just occurred for test3 while notifications have already occurred for test1 and test2 but did not acknowledge dismiss them could for instance tap on the roll up and dismiss test2 it will then be removed from the notification area the only way to stop this roll up of events is to either dismiss the notification as it occurs dont set notification for these events
43518 that cannot be changed that is how android works all downloads from google play goes to the internal filesystem then from settings manage applications tap on said app check if button move to sdcard is enabled then you can do so if the button move to sdcard is disabled or greyed out its probably to prevent the app from functioning such as their own widgets on home screen also see this answer in the related side bar to the right of this page
43522 this article at howtogeek describes possible way utilizing the adb enable usb debugging connect your device to your computer execute the command adb shell pm setinstalllocation or new syntax adb shell pm set install location disconnect done this command will set the devices default installation target to your sdcard that doesnt necessarily mean everything gets installed there only apps supporting this will go there and devs can overrule this in their apps manifest if they think its needed from the linked api reference changes the default install location location values auto let system decide the best location internal install on internal device storage external install on external media note this is only intended for debugging using this can cause applications to break and other undesireable behavior for more details on adb and how you can get minimal version of it to your computer without the overkill of installing the entire sdk you can take look at the adb tag wiki update to avoid confusion with t0mm13bs answer some clearance on the installation process you find some app on google play store and decide to install it after youve clicked install and agreed on terms permissions the apk is downloaded to data local to your internal storage you cant change that when the download is completed the apk will be installed automatically where to depends on multiple things if the dev did not specify the android installlocation property in his apps manifest the app will be installed to internal story full stop no other choice see api reference if this android installlocation is set to preferexternal and external storage is available it will go there if its set to auto it again depends does the app contain widgets services wants to start at boot and several other things it goes to internal storage full stop no other choice it goes where the devices default install location points to
43539 the answer is yes there is an open source project available that does exactly that to quote it is software designed to help you by pass great firewall of china gfw different from similar softwares it is designed to run as router instead of running as client installed on some device being router means you can have one thing android mobile phone for example running fqrotuer then other devices can just connect the wireless network created by fqrouter blog fqrouter source fqrouter
43741 there is free as in freedom application send reduced available at the droid repository of free software install droid install send reduced select your photos press share button select send reduced and then select the sharing method your photos will be sent reduced in resolution and file size
43848 said newline really fast and it did it on jelly bean when said new line slower it filled in the words new line guess you just say it quick
43867 they are included in android the correct settings are determined by your sim mcc and mnc mobile country code and mobile network code if you want you can view the list of preset apns by looking at the source code for example at android source browsing the file name in this case is etc apns full conf xml but apparently it varies
43879 next to the pre configured settings from etc apns full conf xml as described in oniks answer some providers offer to send you so called service sms for an automated configuration opinions on those are quite confusing some say those do not work on android or ios devices and youd have to enter apn data manually simyo in germany while others even let you select your device in advance to send you tailored service sms mobile gernamy where selected an sgs3 and then was asked to enter my phone number to receive the sms or base germany which is the same provider network as simyo one might say thats due to the fact that simyo is discounter brand im with mentioned provider named base belonging to the plus group when got my new optimus 4x inserted the sim and started it immediately got service sms which were executed on my device unfortunately did not check the configuration before so cannot say what effect they had if any but at least ive got no error messages and everything was working fine edit comments from onik on his answer and compro01 here see below indicate whether those service sms do work or not might well depend on the device and rom used
43893 yes youll lose your updates along with any other installed app that didnt come with stock but you will be able to re update the apps via google play and you wont lose any purchases you made they are stored forever on the google cloud im not sure why youre concerned about it though can understand not wanting to lose your settings and data but the only downside to losing app updates is the time and bandwidth required to re update them afterwards edit you are probably asking about os updates your phone does not keep an original os image thus once you update your os either by ota updates or by installing custom rom you will not be able to revert to the older android version doing factory reset should just reset the phone to clean slate of the current android version
43896 performing factory reset on an android device does not remove os upgrades it simply removes all user data this includes the following apps downloaded from google play store or otherwise side loaded onto the device even if you moved them to external storage preferences and data for all apps downloaded or pre loaded on the device this includes call sms mms logs contacts save games etc personalized system settings saved wi fi networks and passwords etc any google accounts youve added along with saved credentials the factory restore does not touch the following contents of external storage micro sd card or for devices without it part of internal memory that is set aside for this purpose such as web downloads photos and videos youve taken with the device music youve copied over from your pc documents and other media exception is the apps that were moved to external storage core components such as system apps along with apps pre loaded by your carrier and or manufacturer into the system partition android kernel and bootloader these core components are what defines the operating system version network unlock status keep in mind that if youve updated any system apps via play store those updates will be lost and the apps will revert to the version that ships with the os
43974 at first thought this was most likely an instance of android cloud to device messaging but it cant be whatsapp doesnt declare the necessary permissions and it works in eclair android while cloud to device messaging and its replacement google cloud messaging require at least froyo android however it is most likely some sort of push notification service its impossible to say exactly how its implemented without access to whatsapps source code the part about it being able to receive messages when not in use is relatively easy to explain though the app almost certainly has service which runs in the background to check in with the server periodically or receive the server push or whatever it does when you receive message the service pops up notification as for the question as to how the server could do push heres possibility again cant verify without source code whatsapp starts and opens two sockets one to listen on and one to send message to the server whatsapps starts listening on the first socket whatsapp sends message containing your phone number and the port of the listening socket to the server and waits for an acknowledgement the server records the phone and port numbers in the message and the ip address that the message came from the server sends an acknowledgement to the app the app receives the acknowledgement and closes the message socket message with your phone number as the destination comes into the server the server uses the ip address and port number it has associated with your phone number and uses that information to push the message to your phone for this to work the app would need to monitor the state of the network connection and reset the listening socket resend the registration message when necessary if the ip address changes for example
43994 the settings you have to change are at wallet google com sign in with your account go to settings and change home address to your new address you might also have to change your phone number and your default billing and delivery address in the second tab note that this will not let you buy contents from country you dont live in since you need credit card and an ip from that country
44006 what turned out to actually do it in the end was to make an actual purchase in google wallet had updated all my information as well as added new card with my new address attached to it this in itself however didnt seem to be enough later though actually purchased something through play using the new card and after that could access things in play that previously could not due to regional restrictions there may be some form of prioritization between different cards so its possible that you need to remove your pre existing cards as well michael hoffman mentions that it may be enough to click to begin download until you reach the accept and buy screen and thus there is no need to complete the purchase otherwise getting refund after the purchase could save you the money for those moving countries it might be useful to check googles acceptable payment methods page dont know if its necessary but user ikon also adds this after adding new card went to the apps settings and wiped plays data rebooted phone accepted terms again for play and now can install
44038 it prevents that your ear is doing input actions on the touchscreen when you are making call most proximity sensors are simply light sensors that will detect proximity when they are covered
44039 the proximity sensor on most smart phones with touchscreen exists to disable accidental touch events the most common scenario is the ear coming in contact with the screen and generating touch events while on call
44150 in terminal emulator become root su list users to get their id its the first number listed usually for the first user is owner ie user owner pm list users stop the users execution instance logoff am stop user id usually am stop user you cant logoff the device owner id
44180 developers can get access to the sensor and use it for other things at users suggestion use it in my biking app ipbike to wake up the screen the user just has to wave there hand over the sensor and the screen switches back on very handy when cycling with gloves on
44200 to make one of eldarerathis cons less critical one could use tasker or locale together with the secure settings plugin to automatically toggle usb debugging on for safe locations based on cell towers network gps location wifi networks connected or in reach and toggle it off exit task with tasker when leaving such with nfc tag and the locale nfc plugin it could also be switched it on off on demand all that even without touching the screen so it would work even if the screen is broken and that unscrupulous individual then would have to be in your safe location or have your tag and must know those circumstances which is much less risky if your device does not belong to that small group having trouble mounting their storage with usb debugging turned on this would leave almost no con then
44276 if there are lot of them it might be easier to just clear all default applications you can do this without installing an app or having to look through list go to settings then apps in the devices section from the overflow menu pick reset app preferences the next time you have more than one app for something youll get the app chooser any apps that you really did want as default you can set again in the same way you did before
44295 in short github is using the internal account system manager to store your github credentials this works the exact same was as adding google account or an exchange account essentially you are logging in with your credentials and they are stored in the account manager which prevents you from having to re enter these credentials again in the future this is most useful when the credentials are used across multiple applications as you only have to login once for example google chrome will access your account via the account manager instead of forcing you to login again the yellow dialog that pops up at the bottom asking if you want to sign in with your locally held account on your phone when visiting gmail or another google website on your phones google chrome browser what does it mean they can create accounts they can created local accounts on your phone for their application and only their application heres an example of list on my phone screenshot click image for larger variant why would amazon kindle app github even need this it simplifies credentials in android its the recommended method to do this are there any risks there shouldnt be if an app uses the accountmanager and say wants to use your google account then it will have to explicitly ask you for permission as it needs an auth token to use that account see more info on the sdk documentation
44528 im budius the developer of the wifi shoot and must say that j4velins explanation is really spot on and pretty sad started developing it just because saw this cool technology and no one was using it but it only proved to be big headache even during development was using transformer tf300 and galaxy nexus it took me much more time than it should had and had lots and lots of problems simply because the technology is broken on the driver level example of that is that asus removed support for wifi direct on their jelly bean built of the transformer and that was reason for one of my star rating it stopped work on the user transformer if my app was completely free probably was going to the same approach of j4velin and simply pull the plug on it but now feel cant just cancel it for the users that paid for it started checking some options to allow it to operate over normal wifi too and only use wifi direct if the user specifically request for it but its personal project and simply dont have free time now really hope the manufacturers get their act together but wouldnt put my hopes up anyone who always uses bluetooth everyday technology that was originally developed in know that sometimes you have to reboot your mobile just to have it connect to headset
44593 updated my rom to cm variant slimbean to be specific and found this in the settings this worked for me thanks to bassmadrigals comment
44595 the facebook home app doesnt really do much itself it gets all its data from the main facebook app so it doesnt need to access the internet doing any action from the launcher uses an intent to launch the main facebook app so it doesnt need to say access your location or take photos to make posts only the main facebook app does to take another example say you use facebook home to like something facebook home doesnt go to facebooks servers it tells the main facebook app on your phone so not using the internet to like the thing then the main facebook app which does have the internet permission uses the internet to tell facebooks servers about the like the same goes for the size all the facebook functionality sync code custom button graphics libraries and so on are in the main facebook app so why would they duplicate them in facebook home facebook home probably just has little code for laying out the home screen few icons and the information android needs to understand that the app is launcher the apps can use each other this way because theyre both by the same developer actually theres little more to it than that but thats the first requirement android verifies this by looking at the signatures on each app to check they were both signed with the same private key in this case key that facebook the company has without this private key another developer cant create another app or modify this app that can use the facebook app like this its also possible for an app to create new type of permission so as an example the main facebook app could create read my facebook timeline permission and then could write an app dans bookface which would be able to request that permission in order to read the timeline directly from the facebook app without needing the internet permission when you install dans bookface youd see read my facebook timeline in the list of permissions just like you do with the permissions built into the system

44743 do research on li ion batteries why batteries fade over time is still an issue that is unknown at the fundamental level what can tell you is that there is solid electrolyte interphase sei which forms upon the first charging cycle this sei protects the negative electrode but it is suggested that the sei leads to fading over time if you fail to charge the battery fully the first cycle the sei will not fully form and may lead to fading over time have experienced this and really dont think it is myth there is so much info out there if this is myth or not nobody will ever know will tell you this for sure read that battery university page its total you should read some current scientific papers on the issue

45955 touchscreen tablet is not like wacom tablet drawing tablets use stylus with one or two pressure sensitive tips and several buttons the stylus is also sensitive to the angle you hold it at and the tablet can detect when the stylus is hovering above the tablet even with no contact drawing tablet has resolution of fraction of millimetre you can wield the stylus like calligraphy pen an airbrush or anything in between capacitive touchscreen such as you get on nexus is designed to detect fat blobs like finger tips it cant react to you hovering over it to the natural pressure changes you get over the course of stroke or to the angle samsungs note series has pretty advanced stylus and it makes nice drawing tool but it still lacks the advanced features like angle sensitivity sure you can use touchscreen to draw and to create artwork but asking it to replace wacom tablet is like asking finger painting to replace the whole range of artists paintbrushes youll never be satisfied with the results
45966 therere also apps like internet booster promising to clear dns cache amongst other things didnt try it out myself and furthermore there seems no way to do only that just one optimize button which applies improvements also its effects might differ between devices says the apps description but it might be better than reboot btw while not mentioning root as requirement it might still be needed there are several similar apps listed on google play but be aware that most of them include airpush ads and or want excessive permissions which is why didnt name them here another possible solution not tested by myself found at madpc seemingly quoting user8522s answer before stating the last option but most intensive on the user themselves unless they want to just wait the update out have your users go into settings applications network location clear data another short howto mentions different easy way to flush dns again didnt test this myself simply switch to airplane mode oops no network and back ah there it is should do the trick might sound stupid but could imagine when entering airplane mode android does something similar to etc init networking stop which has dns flush as side effect very easy solution was supplied by dtumaykin in the comments below simply switching to airplane mode and back might already do it of course with the side effect of the network going down for couple of seconds though it might not work on some devices its worth try no extra installs and easily performed even by n00bs if anybody tried one of those solutions confirmation or the opposite is surely welcome

46202 this looks like the acer gps log leak we had on an acer iconia a200 the bottom line is that when the gps is used the gps driver for ics on the acer series tablets apparently writes numerous gl yyyy mm dd hhmmss txt files into the data gps directory the files are apparently not automatically deleted and so over time will consume most of the internal storage space users can not delete these files without root access however there is patch to clear the gps log data no root access needed so no warranty voided download the patch from the acer drivers site to your desktop unzip and copy the contained update zip from it to an empty fat32 formatted microsd card we uploaded it to an already present card in the connected tablet which wasnt empty but it still worked restart the tablet with the microsd card in it while holding the volume down key until message appears in the upper left corner of the screen something like erasing cache before sd update interpret this message as erase and update so it should cure the symptom and the cause the tablet will continue to start up afterwards less than minute and you will be good to go there is nice pdf in the download describing the above steps in detail with screenshots it also talks about an accompanying user cleangpslog text file but we didnt have it and did not seem to need it
46215 lies damned lies and equipment specs can print up lovely sticker that says itll output 1000a doesnt mean itll output that its significantly cheaper to make low power supply than it is to make high power power supply making the latter means you need bigger transformer with heavier windings larger capacitors larger inductors and higher current rectifiers all of which add up to more money if youre trying to make stuff on the cheap and arent worried about pesky things like ethics youll go with the lower end components and massage the specs by testing at low temperatures etc this is especially common with computer power supplies which specify output at 25c even though they would actually operate at 40c unless youre using them inside refrigerator use theoretical values rather than actually testing the product saving money on qa or just outright lie about the specs the latter of which is probably the case with this charger for reasons below one big red warning light that your charger is substandard is that the ce mark which is used to indicate conformance to eu standards is fake the shape of the letters and their spacing is wrong real ce mark should have the letters each forming half and bit circle and should link up if you continue the arc as shown below cursory glance at the mark on your charger shows it looks nothing like this the ccc mark indicating compliance to chinese standards is also fake other warnings signs include having no manufacturer listed and improper capitalization should be ma not ma unless theyre claiming is can supply billion amps in essence to determine if charger is likely to be substandard apply the same thoughts as you would for determining whether product is counterfeit the only real difference between substandard product and most counterfeits is whether manufacturers label is forged or not
46250 aside from the actual power provided theres another variable whether the device recognizes that the charger is capable of putting out the rated amps devices have some different strategies for recognizing what rating charger has now when connected to computer its easy the numbers come across during usb enumeration but when connecting to dumb charger its harder and you dont want to try to draw too much as that will cause the chargers over current protection to kick in and cut it off know that apple uses specific set of resistors in their charges to produce specific voltages on the usb data lines their devices then look for those voltages and take them to mean that they can draw some larger amount of current the problem with this is that there dont seem to be lot of standards on this detection different devices seem to do different things id guess that your cheapo charger doesnt do whatever the galaxy nexus requires to recognize that the charger is capable of amp so it doesnt try to charge at the higher rate
46321 this is apparently known bug in android which is not even acknowledged by google since oct bug depending on the method of creating files on the android device these files may remain invisible when accessing the device using mtp until the device is rebooted known workarounds include use usb storage mode instead of mtp if it is supported by the phone this is apparently not an option for lg optimus l5 e610 because this phone has unified internal storage file storage is in data media on the same ext4 filesystem as data which cannot be exported as an usb storage device clear data of the media storage app then use the sdrescan app to rebuild the media database discussed here share files over the network using third party apps such as airdroid or one of samba server apps in the latter case you will need to have root to make the server reachable from most clients including windows
46341 update my preferred way to get userscripts on android would now be to use the firefox browser which has working well maintained add ons available for both greasemonkey and tampermonkey search for them through the add ons menu in the firefox app pasting the javascript into the address bar still works at least on chrome but note that chrome now strips out the javascript prefix when you paste in the code if you dont retype it it will just do web search the mobile versions of chrome and opera also now based on chromium dont support userscript add ons but the tampermonkey standalone app is still available from the play store it hasnt been updated since but still just about works however given its age it wont support many of the features of the current greasemonkey tampermonkey api or modern websites in general as result many userscripts wont work without modification its also tricky to figure out how to install them in the first player use the textarea utility hidden under the advanced settings there are also tampermonkey extensions for the dolphin and uc browsers available in the play store havent tried them but they havent been updated since original answer solution use tampermonkey tampermonkey is more popular as an extension for chrome but it is also available as standalone android app it functions as lightweight browser and allows you to manage and automatically run user scripts unfortunately it doesnt have many of the features found on other popular browsers but it does support the greasemonkey api solution use opera mobile which has built in support for userscripts but no script management features and doesnt support the greasemonkey api navigate to the user prefs section of opera config then tick always load user javascript and user javascript enter the path to folder not file in the user javascript file field use sdcard userscripts then store the settings save your userscript in that folder with user js extension nb this works in om12 but the om14 beta doesnt seem to support userscripts at present solution launch your userscript manually via bookmarklet or pasting this javascript directly into the browser address bar javascript function var document createelement script src http path to myscript user js document head appendchilda this technique is tedious but the principle should work in most browsers you dont get greasemonkey api support though the code above should work without modification in the stock android browser and can be saved as bookmarklet in chrome mobile the space in the var needs escaping var 20a and bookmarklets dont seem to work so you have to paste manually every time
46495 actually had my sdcard on ext4 and got it mounted permanent at boot time have root on my phone the biggest problem was that the apps don expect permission checking on sdcard but extx enforces this no mount option around this so if one app stores some audio there and calls another subcomponent to play it it fails the same is true for photos camera shots them some previewer might want to access them you can manually fix this but you have to run after every new file created there would be an nice real solution to this but it requires system modification let the apps run with umask002 instead of android is upg user private groups so there is no big harm in doing so now the apps could choose if they want to expose files to others by setting the group to sdcard or not this would also add to an enforced separation where the apps want it
46523 the real problem with service call is that transaction codes are not only undocumented but also not guaranteed to be stable they can be silently changed between android versions because of this service call commands should never be used except for private debugging when you know what android version is used example itelephony transaction codes for android itelephony transaction codes for android here first call transaction so the actual transaction code which should be used in the service call phone command is the number seen in the source plus note that in the new version transaction supplypuk was inserted in the middle and all following codes are now shifted by anything that used service call phone to perform those transaction will horribly break when used on android the same codes will result in calling completely different methods possibly with disastrous results

47117 as it turns out there is no magic file or directory that contains all settings they are stored in various places and depends greatly on how the manufacturer decides to set things up primarily work with samsung phones so the information here will mostly be samsung oriented also note that all of the below requires root access if anyone has anything to add rectify feel free to comment first off have found that copying settings is not always the best way to go you can do nandroid backups and restores which pretty much clones one phone to another if youre technical enough and youre using samsung then creating your own odin image might be an even better option as it doesnt rely on you or someone else having created nandroid recovery support the settings general settings settings are mostly stored in the data subdirectory if youre looking for something specific start there built in apps built in apps tend to keep their settings in data data com android and data data com google android for example contacts data data com android contacts email accounts data data com android email mms data data com android mms wifi wifi settings location depends on the manufacturer but is generally predictable samsung galaxy pocket s2 s3 data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf samsung tab data wifi bcm supp conf htc desire data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf dell streak data misc wifi wpa conf oneplus data misc wifi networkhistory txt keyboard configs have had to disable hardware keys reconfigure layouts or alter general keyboard behaviour before the exact file name tends to be different on every phone but ive found the config files to always be in system usr keylayout be careful as breaking those could render your phone unusable misc most miscellaneous settings like product information boot sounds and enabling disabling the on screen nav bar are stored in system build prop breaking this config file could bootloop your device if find more information ill add later
47434 theres only times youll want need to install gapps on the initial install of cyanogenmod rom or pretty much any custom rom that doesnt have gapps integrated since cm nightlies are the rom only you only need to install it once every subsequent install of nightly only overwrites the rom contents and doesnt touch gapps when you know theres an updated gapps package the gapps package itself is updated from time to time and youll usually want the most recent version installed to be clear all official cyanogenmod roms are the rom only with all google apps stripped out hence having to install gapps seperately this was due to cease and desist order from google to cyanogen back in to remove google apps from its roms cm roms have been sans gapps since

47925 the answer to your question you are asking is too big can however give you basic answer which covers the basics there are two kinds of apps root and non root root apps can basically store modify files wherever they want non root apps can only store modify files here sdcard and every folder what comes after mostly the installed apps store themselves at sdcard android data or sdcard android obb some apps store their save games configuration data files on sdcard appname or just on the sdcard to be able to use root apps youll need to have rooted your android device and have given permission from one of the superuser apps
47951 all apps root or not have default data directory which is data data package name by default the apps databases settings and all other data go here if an app expects huge amounts of data to be stored or for other reasons wants to be nice to internal storage theres corresponding directory on the sdcard android data package name apart from that all apps can store data anywhere on the sdcard as there are no restrictions and many apps do so they can use directory names freely and they again do which is what often makes it hard to decide what all that junk on the card is intended for and what of it can be deleted though as tom pointed out root apps could store their data almost everywhere on your device they usually follow the same rules as other apps you can find general explanation of the android directory hierarchy in my answer here for your specific question might add some more details on the data data package name and corresponding sd part databases here go the apps databases lib libraries and helpers for the app files other related files shared prefs preferences and settings cache well caches there might be several more directories in this place or fewer it all depends on the app in its own home directory and thats what it basically is spoken linux wise they can place files where they want usually these files and directories are only accessible by the app itself and root of course other than those stored on the sdcard which are accessible by all apps

48408 how they detect that someone is tethering device isnt something that network providers often want to talk about for the obvious reason that the more consumers know about how this is being detected the easier it is for them to find ways to hide the fact that theyre doing it and avoid the associated extra charges however there are certain known techniques that will give away the fact that youre currently tethering if your service provider happens to be running the right tool to check for these indicators your phone asks your network if tethering is allowed the first and easiest method is that some phones will query the network to check whether the current contract allows tethering and then totally disable the tethering options on the device in software if not this generally only happens if you are running an os version that has been customized by your provider example example your phone tells your network that you are tethering its also rumoured that some phones have second set of apn details saved in them by the phone network when you enable tethering they switch over to using this second apn for all tethered traffic while using the normal apn for traffic originating on the phone however havent found any concrete evidence of this other than people finding odd apns and wondering what theyre for bear in mind that an unlocked phone bought off contract may have hundreds or thousands of apns stored on it ready for use on whichever network in whichever country the eventual owner decides to use it inspecting the network packets for their ttl time to live every network packet travelling across tcp ip network like the internet has built in time to live ttl set on it so that in case there is problem with that packet reaching its destination this will stop it travelling around the network forever clogging everything up the way this works is that the packet starts with ttl number say set on it when it leaves the sending device your phone or laptop and then every time that packet travels through router of any kind like your home broadband router or router at your isp or phone company that router subtracts one from the ttl which would decrement the ttl to in this example the next router it travels through will in turn decrement the ttl again and so on if the ttl ever reaches zero then the router its at discards the packet and doesnt transmit it again when your phone is tethering it acts like router so as the packet passes from your tethered laptop through your phone and onto the phone network your phone will subtract from the ttl to show that the packet has passed through its first router the phone networks know what the expected ttls from common devices are for instance packets from an iphone always start at ttl of and so they can spot when theyre one less or totally different than theyre expecting mac address inspection devices on tcp ip network like the internet all have unique mac id set on their network interfaces this is made up of two halves one half identifying the manufacturer of the interface and the other half being unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer like serial number every network packet that is sent out will have been stamped with the mac address of the originating devices network port the mac address of your laptops wifi card will have very different manufacturer and serial code than the mac address of your phones 3g interface tcp ip stack fingerprinting different computer operating systems eg android ios windows mac osx linux etc set up their tcp ip stacks with different default values and settings eg the initial packet size initial ttl window size the combination of these values can give fingerprint that can be used to identify what operating system is running on the originating device side effect of this may mean that if youre using an uncommon os or an os thats similar to your phones on your other device your tethering may not be spotted looking at the destination ip url you can learn lot by what device regularly communicates with for instance many oss these days do captive portal detection when they first connect to wifi network such as your wifi tether connection they do this by trying to connect to known web server across the internet and checking to see if they get the response that theyre expecting if the expected response is not received then its likely that the wifi connection youre on is captive portal and may need you to log in or pay to connect to it as microsoft oss like windows vista and windows check with microsoft server by default and other oss like android macos and so on all connect to their parent companys servers to do these checks it can be used as good indication of the operating system just after the initial connection is made additionally if device regularly contacts the windows update servers then its very likely that device is windows pc or laptop whereas if it regularly checks with googles android update servers then its probably phone or if they can see that youre connecting to the apple app store but the imei of the device that your sim card is in indicates that its not an apple device maybe youre tethering an ipad to an android phone more sophisticated systems can look at whole range of data seeing who youre communicating with eg are you connecting to the facebook apps api servers which is more likely from phone or to facebooks web servers which is more likely from pc and add whole load of these indicators together to create fingerprint that indicates what sort of device youre likely to be using some of these fingerprints can be caught out when new device types and services come out for instance there are reports that just after tablets with built in 3g came out some owners of these on the at network received mails warning them that theyd been tethering when they hadnt as the fingerprint from this new style of device didnt look like typical phone obviously before trying any methods to by pass tethering detection please remember to check your phone contract and your phone companys policies on tethering they may have penalty clauses buried in their contract fair use policy or acceptable use policy for people who try to bypass their restrictions and limits

48902 update apparently there was enough of hue and cry about it that theyve added button although ok maps will still work not the same as the old offline maps but better than nothing suppose having come under fire for mostly removing the option to save offline maps in its new android app google has pushed new update that makes it easier for users to save local areas to their device in post on google the company notes that its engineering team has been working around the clock to add make this map area available offline card inside the app mimicking the functionality of the ok maps command source the verge at least im not the only one who regrets the removal of this feature the other problem with the redesign is that google mostly removed the option to save offline maps feature that was only year old to begin with power users still have way to cache maps locally however daniel graf director for google maps tells us that the companys engineers were just as unhappy with the loss of the feature as we were so they built an easter egg when you type in ok maps or okay maps into the search box it will save cached version of the visible map area locally its not as convenient or manageable as proper offline maps but at least its an option assuming you remember its there source the verge
48943 be patient it can take while for your device to show on there
48962 open google maps and search for the area you want to cache or just zoom in on it tap the search bar type okay maps some people report success with just ok maps in the search bar tap the search icon youll be dropped back at the maps view and youll see notification that the area was copied to your clipboard or otherwise cached now even offline youll still be able to zoom down to the same level you were at on that map area
48969 this also annoyed me my language is hungarian hard to translate language for example google translated the loop device to hungarian as rotating device which is different thing think it is really bad idea the app which does not have the users native language built in and the user doesnt speak any language of that app then that user will not be able to understand and use that app normally also of translations arent understandable so after that beginning solved my problem installed xposed and that appinfo module than changed the language setting in the appinfo for google play lastly cleared the cache of google play and voil all in english and can understand everything
49069 the best way to use two different languages either on smartphone or on tablet is from device standard settings with device keyboard and also with external usb and bluetooth keyboard to use more than one language follow the images cant post images yet general settings language and input option of samsung keyboard input languages here you can chose between many languages so you have setted correctly now to use one or the other language when you write is very easy you have to slide with finger on the spacebar of the device keyboard
49070 alas the usbstorageactivity doesnt use an intent to enable and disable usb mass storage so theres no way to achieve this using am it instead calls the functions storagemanager enableusbmassstorage and storagemanager disableusbmassstorage to do its work as these functions are hidden in the framework its not possible to write an app to do this either as far as know theres no existing command to do this it might be possible to write an app that offers command line interface and uses the bound system service mountservice to call its setusbmassstorageenabled function but that would be way off topic for this site

49425 lets talk about sets baby androids backup service has concept called set the set of all data backed up from one device on one transport but thats detail each set is identified by unique string such as the imei on the device when an app or the list of installed apps is backed up its backup data go into the set associated with the device its being backed up from all the sets are still specific to the users google account if you wipe your device and sell it to someone else he wont be able to access that devices set unless he can log into your google account default behaviour when an app is installed or device has its list of apps restored the backup system first looks in that devices set for backup data for that package if it doesnt find any either because its completely new device with no backed up data or because that package has never been installed on that device itll expand the search to other sets if theres choice itll use the last set that was used for full device restore thus when you set up new device itll restore the list of apps from an old devices backup and restore each app from the old devices backup if you had an app installed on one device and you install it on another device the app will be restored with its data from the old device in either case the data are now backed up into the new devices set which means that the backup data from the two devices are separate from now on after you factory reset device itll restore from that devices last backup if there is one and failing that from some other devices backup if there is one but it will start to create its own set from then on thats why nalums two devices dont see each others backed up apps theyre each restoring from their own last backups source this mechanism doesnt have any user facing documentation since its supposed to automatically do the right thing but the code is available bmgr basic use as izzy found the bmgr tool gives you some control over this process its intended as an aid for programmers to help test and debug the backup integration in their apps you can use this tool in an adb shell to trigger backups and restores of chosen packages wipe packages backed up data and even whole device restore dont try to use it in an on device shell except as root you need the system level android permission backup to do anything interesting with it you can make an app update its backed up data immediately bmgr backup com shadowburst showr bmgr run or whatever the apps package name is theres not normally any need to do this as apps request their own backups whenever their data changes but this lets you work around badly written app to restore one package from the backed up data it would choose by default bmgr restore com shadowburst showr but again this will only do what the device would do on its own so you shouldnt need to use it note also that the device already needs to be installed to make this work more control now for the stuff that the backup system wont do on its on to see what sets of backed up data are available bmgr list sets and youll get some output like this 3ff7800e963f25c5 manta 3f0e5c90a412cca7 manta 3dd65924a70e14c8 tf101 3baa67e9ce029355 m0 the bit hex number on the left is token youll need this in minute the thing on the right is relatively friendly name for the device that owns the set for example manta is the code name for the nexus tf refers to the original asus eee pad transformer once youve figured out which set you want you can restore an app from that set using its token bmgr restore 3ff7800e963f25c5 com shadowburst showr you can add more package names to the end of the command to restore several packages at once or you can specify no package name just the token to restore every app with data in that set that is it does full system restore finally you can wipe an apps data from the current set bmgr wipe com shadowburst showr this will make its next backup operation start from scratch this might be useful after uninstalling an app if an error in the app corrupted its backup data and you dont want it restored you cant make device start writing into different set nor can you wipe whole set
49802 found how pm disable works if you run cat system bin pm it gives script to start pm on the device which has very rudimentary shell base system export classpath base framework pm jar exec app process base bin com android commands pm pm so apparently it is the same as the packagemanager we use from java it is calling it just in root context that no user app can directly access you can check if something is frozen using getpackagemanager getapplicationenabledsetting the package name getpackagemanager component enabled state disabled
49901 am certainly sure that whatsapp does not open any listening ports most isps block incoming requests that would not work whatsapp has service basically that means that technically you never quit whatsapp so the way you receive messages while youre not running whatsapp is the exact same way you receive them when youre running it the client in this case whatsapp connects to the server the client maintains that connection when the server has something new to say it sends it to the client via that connection and thats all your first guess is correct whatsapp has no true log out mechanism see this whatsapp does not have logout mechanism the application is designed to always be connected so that you receive your messages quickly even when you are not actively using your phone this is similar to how sms works and allows whatsapp messages to be delivered almost instantly
50222 you cant drag in route points of given google maps for android route you can instead drag departure and arrival spots spots drag in route points is indeed very interesting feature but not available in google maps for android yet you can drag the markers by doing click images for larger variant when needed open google maps and tap direction icon select either my location or point in the map in the example selected point in the map same step with destination you touch wherever you want the point in the map tap the button to get the route when you see the departure arrival green markers in the screen you can just tap and hold to drag them to other locations the route will get auto updated to new locations
50298 also had the same issue incase you are on vodafone network try and select vodafone gprs as ur default settings it worked for me the same way hope this suggestion helps
50483 as of this moment it is not possible to convert user into profile however you could create profile based on the existing user downside since profile doesnt have google account tied to it they cant have gmail app and as you have already mentioned they would also lose those user specific data update from android com it says that restricted profile is subset of users account its using the same user account albeit restricted so the profile is quite different from user where its tied to different google account each restricted profile offers an isolated and secure space with its own local storage home screens widgets and settings unlike with users profiles are created from the tablet owner environment based on the owner installed apps and system accounts the owner controls which installed apps are enabled in the new profile and access to the owner accounts is disabled by default
50498 when referring to aosp you are referring to the original source android open source project direct from google that is the base stock rom that manufacturers and rom modders use as base many rom makers fork the aosp source for their version to name but few lineageos cyanogenmod cafogen replicant codeaurora aokp touchwiz having an aosp stock rom is not an easy feat to achieve for devices outside of googles supporting devices such as nexus motorola it is simple and clean rom with no extras in it such as power widgets in the notification bar thing is lot of people seem to imply that any version of rom is based on stock rom truth be told it is not it has enhancements and extras that stock rom does not have the term stock rom is bandied about lot to an extent it can be misleading stock rom is aosp full stop manufacturers love to imply that their rom is stock when it clearly is not touchwiz from samsung is one culprit and people who use samsung devices refer to that as stock aokp as per the ops question is similar to cyanogenmod with extras that may not be found in cyanogenmod android open kang project kang being the keyword meaning copy of or unofficial when rom modder says this project is kanged from cm meaning its built unofficially for the device in question even if the device is supported for the case of cyanogenmod some modders replicate the source to their machine build it and distribute it for the supporting device out of perhaps due to impatience that distribution is called kang in the view point of cyanogenmod if it was built officially by the build bots employed by cm its labelled official
50608 aosp android open source project is the project with the open source parts of android its used as base by anyone who wants to build or customize an android rom although new android features are developed in secret inside google when new android version is released all the code changes to the open source parts get merged into aosp soon afterwards soon is relative term sometimes its not very soon at all conversely google receives and incorporates changes submitted to aosp such as to fix bugs from outside but sometimes with delay because they have to create release branch of the source long before the next release aosp doesnt include the closed source components mainly thats hardware drivers and googles special apps that only ship with certified devices google play google now etc aokp is one particular custom rom project like other custom roms its based on aosp but adds extra features the maintainers also need to find possibly closed source drivers for all the hardware on device in order to support that device generally most people use the term stock rom to mean the manufacturers rom that came with their device possibly including any ota updates as t0mm13b points out this rom almost certainly wasnt built from aosp the source will be based on aosp or googles internal sources if the manufacturer is big enough to have access to them but it will include any drivers for that device as well as the manufacturers customizations such as samsungs touchwiz or htcs sense if youre interested in the discussion of what exactly constitutes stock rom you might like to read the comments on this answer from last year tl dr authors of custom roms dont all use the term to mean the same thing

51031 if you wish to stop whatapp message from being delivered to recipient have found that after you have sent this and before this is delivered you add the person temporarily to your block list until they come on line next as you can still see there date stamp the message then doesnt get delivered you can then reinstate them and the message will never get delivered and stays in the status of hope that helps
51045 yes android keeps one active connection to googles servers but it doesnt use much power or data because no traffic is sent along it until something sends gcm message to an app on your phone theres only one connection on the phone used by all apps installing new app that uses gcm doesnt add any extra load the first step in gcm is that third party server such as an email server sends request to googles gcm server this server then sends the message to your device through that open connection the android system looks at the message to determine which app its for and starts that app the app must have registered with android to use gcm and it must have the relevant permission when the app starts it might create notification straight away with the data from the message gcm messages are very limited in size so the app might instead open normal connection to the third party server to get more information for example downloading the headers of new emails the advantage of using push notifications is that apps dont have to run at regular intervals to check for new data saving both power and data the advantage of having centralized mechanism like gcm is that the device only needs one open network connection and the android gcm system is the only thing that needs to keep running rather than each app having to stay running in the background to keep its own network connection to its own server
51066 this is because the command you used to invoke heimdall was heimdall flash recovery and heimdall is caps sensitive try this instead heimdall flash recovery clockworkmod jfltespr img no reboot
51175 the samsung app store is installed on every samsung mobile device which is lot they are ultra helpful unlike every other app store have submitted to it can take over week to get new app past their quality control but its worth the wait they are so good at reviewing apps that now submit to samsung before google play it can be little confusing at first to understand what they call their seller office is all about but hey we are developers so are used to learning curves among other things they review content to ensure that there are no copyright issues something that can get you banned from google play and they review every option very thoroughly on all the devices you have selected if anything goes wrong and quality control fails you get complete breakdown of exactly what went wrong including log cat and even video replicating the issue and they provide details on what is expected from you to fix it and re submit what really impresses me is that they are so constructive with their criticisms once an app has been approved by samsung am more than happy that have very solid app that functions the way want it to just get comfortable feeling when samsung approves one of my apps they dont tell you off or slap you on the wrists or in any other way treat you like naughty school kid if you get something wrong they just help you to understand what to put right google play will just pull your app and suspend you with no help whatsoever to put things right
51441 disable the google contacts sync app settings apps all googlecontactssyncadapter disable and reboot then try adding contact again if this does not help and you have rooted your android then you can delete system app googlecontactssyncadapter apk with file browser but take backup first either way next time you create contact you should be informed that the contact will be stored locally as far as can tell this wont break anything else however if you also use another account with sync function like microsoft exchange for hotmail youll have to remove that one too in case of microsoft exchange its best to remove the entire account because just disabling the app prevents you from receiving emails anyway source
51458 to manage accounts android uses several permissions some of them are easily misunderstood very good explanation on using accounts can be found in dans answer on the question what can an app do with the use accounts on the device permission let me try to sum up the permissions involved and what they mean account manager this permission is reserved for system apps an account manager is the service working behind the scenes and taking care everything works as expected authenticate accounts an app using this permission usually provides an interface to deal with certain account type which is not known by the pre installed android system such as dropbox as shipped android does not know how to login to dropbox and how to deal with dropbox account so the dropbox app provides the mechanism additionally an account authenticator might restrict the actions an app can perform with the account so it would be possible to administrate this via some web interface offered by the service get accounts obtain list of available accounts this way an app which wants to use dropbox for storage can check if fitting account is available it must verify this before using it manage accounts the api documentation is not that clear about this permission but according to bryans answer an app can only delete modify an account it created itself of course it can create any new account and manage that use credentials this app may use the credentials to log into an account in most cases credentials just means the corresponding authenticator creates fitting token and hands that over though how to deal with that is left to the authenticator when using an account for the first time the account manager should make sure the user is asked whether he permits this again dans answer explains this part well hope was able to shed some light this was something which made me nervous as well so took two days to dig into it if got something wrong please point it out in the comments so can correct it
51584 there isnt anything built in but you can use an app such as changelog droid you would need to add the apps you wish to be notified for to the observed list within the app note it appears this app is no longer being maintained and has problems with paid apps do not know of an alternative at this point this app will still work ok for free apps though
51691 app purchases are not bound to devices but to the google account theyve been purchased with so as long as you use the same google account on the devices there should be no limit afaik
51702 there is no limit from google support downloading previously purchased downloaded apps when you download paid or free app on google play the app is connected to your google account meaning that you get several benefits if you get new device remove an app to free up space or reset your device you can reinstall the app without purchasing it again if you have multiple devices you can install the app on all of your devices without purchasing the app again you can quickly find free or paid apps that you previously downloaded
51740 the snapshot option allows you to use feature thats similar to the hibernate function in windows it saves the contents of the emulators memory to disk when you close the emulator so that when you open it it doesnt have to boot the os but instead it can load the memory contents from the disk and resume from where you left off this allows you to start the emulator faster use host gpu means that instead of using the cpu to render the graphics it uses the computers graphics card this speeds up graphic intensive processes details and requirements can be found on developer android com you should note that snapshots and graphics acceleration are mutually exclusive so you cant use both
51741 the snapshot option speeds up the boot of the emulator by saving snapshot of its ram once it has booted and restoring from that snapshot on future uses that way it doesnt have to run the boot process which is slow because its emulated every time you start the emulator the use host gpu option uses the host computers opengl implementation which is probably hardware accelerated on your real gpu to evaluate opengl commands inside the emulated system put another way when program inside the emulator uses opengl for graphics operations the work goes out to your real gpu and the result goes back into the emulator instead of emulating gpu which is very slow the result is significant speed up especially when you consider that most view and canvas drawing uses opengl in android even in non graphics apps you cant have both options turned on at once

52069 faced similar problem until recently found the fix use vodafone 3g pack if you are an android user check the network and settings access point names in that check if apn is set to vodafone live if yes change it to default settings and it should be changed to vodafone mobile connect also then check the value of mcc and mnc it should be as per country code and mobile operator didnt understand why this changed on its own but after making this change and rebooting phone it worked for me hope this works for you too
52121 adb is not available in the bootloader try using fastboot instead for quick and dirty rundown of flashing your device with new image using fastboot adb reboot bootloader use fastboot devices to verify your device is visible if not youre probably running windows and you have to install some funky drivers if you dont see unlocked at the bottom of the screen use the command fastboot oem unlock then just fastboot flash boot boot img fastboot flash system system img fastboot flash userdata userdata img fastboot flash recovery recovery img if you feel super confident you could just adb reboot bootloader fastboot oem unlock fastboot flash boot boot img fastboot flash system system img fastboot flash userdata userdata img fastboot flash recovery recovery img fastboot reboot ps you should only use the flash commands if the referenced files are present if not you may or may not brick your phone havent tried flashing non existent file to the device yet warning unlocking bootloader wipes off data in your phone
52136 stock recovery doesnt come with adb access try recent version of clockworkmod recovery for your device the older versions dont all have adb support you will need to flash the recovery on using fastboot see mishaps answer
52143 found that saying period newline gives you new line after putting period on the current line also period new paragraph work
52183 according to ifixits teardown the nexus uses the qualcomm snapdragon s4 pro soc qualcomms specs show that soc uses their izat gen8a gnss chipset which according to their overview does include glonass support though this doesnt necessarily mean glonass support is actually active and available in software simple means to test whether youve got glonass is to use gps status and toolbox and see how many satellites it shows for you if it shows more than satellites youre getting both gps and glonass
52186 why when the phone signals are weak the android os constantly scan the area thoroughly this requires more battery power thats the reason your phone gets so hot when you are in areas with poor reception could it be solved that is the reason it is advised to turn flight mode on when you are is low signal areas to preserve your battery life is it hardware problem yes and that problem is common to all the android devices so nothing to worry why not iphone for the comparison with iphone the specs of android device of each manufacturer varies from one another whereas it doesnt in apple deceives not everybody get to produce device which can run ios thanks to the apple inc patents as the android specs vary from device to device it is highly likely that the battery performance will differ from device to device as well
52187 essentially lower signal strength will lead you device to use more power that in turn drains your battery faster and causes the device to heat the farther away you are from the closest cell tower more your device needs to put out higher power level in order to reach the tower transmitting at higher power level requires more energy from the battery an elevated power level causes your device to heat in result of the extra effort being conducted if you are in really weak signal area try turning off mobile data you can still receive calls and sms but not mms
52256 one solution that worked for me is the following host your own instance of owncloud then sync your contacts via caldav google play or for free at droid alternatives would be carddav for contacts and icalsync2 for calendars for another simpler solution see my second answer
52263 compared to my first answer there is another simpler solution that also worked for me use the mylocalaccount app to create local account you can then easily sync your contacts with your pc using myphoneexplorer
52351 they are stored in mnt shell emulated ive just created restricted profile and it created new folder in there with the name the main admin users folder is you should be able to copy the files into the relevant place within these folders to get mine craft to pick them up this was done on the nexus but dont think it will be any different

53066 the only devices that you can be confident about getting timely updates for are nexus devices these tend to get updates for at least months and they receive them as soon as google releases them theyre essentially google devices made by other manufacturers all other manufacturers take while to release an update once it is released by google typical months they also have less incentive to release updates as they want you to buy their latest and greatest new phone
53067 no manufacturer makes any promises about future system updates for device they would shoot themselves in the foot if they would because if the device fails to get good market share the resources needed to keep an device up to date would be lost order to ensure that you get updates for your android devices you have basically two options go with google device that is the ones sold as nexus those devices usually receive android updates first and for long time span years pick device which has an established active mod community or is likely to get one for example samsungs galaxy was massive success it was one of the most sold smartphones at time this is massive incentive for modders to work on the device and deliver good quality mod like cyanogenmod if you go with you could for example go to the cyanogenmod site an research which devices they currently support also try to get feeling how good the device is supported how active the maintainer for the device is
53518 tried this answer but it didnt solve the problem so called google play support they did have me clear data from the play store app but also told me to remove my google account from the accounts section in settings and add it back then they got me to clear the data again from download manager and google play store in the apps section and everything worked perfectly after that
53605 in theory yes in practice it varies from device to device very common way of an end user obtaining root is to flash an insecure kernel this can be standalone kernel or pre rooted kernel rom combination for certain devices there are also available number of 3rd party one click rooting apps that being said rooting might cause your device to be unusable if not done correctly or something unexpected occurs so read the instructions carefully before proceeding and always backup your data to an external source like dropbox or to your pc before you begin heres link unverified on how to root your verizon stellar
53607 short answer that very much depends on your device as the rooting process often is device specific following up to the rooting tag wiki will give you some basic info and also provide link to our rooting index which might even already include link for your device tl dr basically rooting just means to push binary su and helper app superuser superuser or supersu to the system partition so as compro01 wrote in his comment on your question youre customizing your rom somehow on most devices thats all you need though how thats accomplished is different thing as its little chicken and egg you want to gain root permissions on your device and for that you first have to push those two files to system which only can be done with root permissions so in most cases this requires some hacking which is what sparx refers to in his answer might cause your device to be unusable rooted several devices already and when sticking to the instructions the device should not become unusable though admit there might be rare cases had it once device became instable apps crashing device rebooting itself multiple times day but that was easily cured by factory reset
53946 personally wanted to know the answer to this little while ago here is what came up with odexed and deodexed standard rom is supposed to be odexed for release which provides smoother and faster loading of apps into memory each apk has corresponding odex when the application is used by either the system or the user the odex is used to start loading the app rom that is deodexed has only the apk file when the application is called into memory from only pulling the data from it apk this takes longer due to not being optimized for easier retrieval from the system common questions that get asked way too often are why do custom rom deodexed should use odexed or deodexed rom to answer these questions it comes down to one word themability if you talk to anyone that themes rom they will tell you that it extremely easier to theme deodexed rom since we started using deodexed rom themers could now create themes to apply to rom rather than the tedious option to theme the rom itself release custom rom for theme if you use odexed rom and try to apply themes it will not work or only theme some visual aspects which will give you terrible user interface to experience deodex cons bet you are now wondering why why is there even an option to download custom rom that is odexed the answer to that is speed remember how said that odexed files are optimized for easier retrieval simply put it optimized like indexing data table so the system can open the apk faster deodex and zipalign everyone wanted the best of both worlds so quickly after the deodexed trend started to peak these savvy rom developers came up with solution to zipalign at boot this optimizes each apk on every reboot which then allows the system to access applications more efficiently and most importantly faster of course the disadvantage is slightly slower boot times summary if you have choice to download the custom rom odexed or deodexed would just go with the deodex rom you never know when you would want to try out theme or do some modifications yourself and it nice to have easy options rather than flashing whole new rom with newer devices you may not even see noticeable difference to zipalign on boot if your device is pretty slow and outdated well then would suggest to think about this little harder would bet some of you would prefer to get nice minimal optimized odexed rom for better performance and speed over customizing the user interface if youre new the subject you can find some common terms located on my original write up here http codeversed com deodexed vs odexed rom otherwise the above shows you everything you need to know if missed anything please let me know
54029 it is difficult to know whether an apk is safe or not your best bet is to download from trusted or reputable sources like google play amazon etc some trusted developers also provide an md5 or other message digest algorithm hash of their apks after your download the apk you verify if the apk has the same hash if it does then its safe to say it hasnt been tampered with you can also check the permissions required by the apk app and use common sense or your own judgement instinct to tell if its safe to install or not bottomline always install from trusted sources stay away from pirated apks its possible they may have malware
54034 google introduced an option verify apps disallow or warn before installation of apps that may cause harm for side loaded apps when unknown sources is enabled both settings available in settings security device administration you can also use an online virus scanner like virus total to check your downloaded apk file but this is the same with every scanner service theyre not sure and probably only detect already known malicious apps custom tailored malware will probably remain undetected also very new malicious apps will probably slip through until after some time they will be detected
54035 if you are downloading the apk files from unknown untrusted sources theres no easy way to judge most anti whatever solutions anti virus anti malware etc are just ruling by database entries they have database of known malware and check whether the package name matches or only check requested permissions and not whether sms app only sends the smss you wish ive never heard about real heuristics scanner analyzing an apps behaviour though it might theoretically be possible scanner also verifies kind of checksum as the mentioned md5 this could only work against trusted base like playstore for apps not available there it would fail then nothing to compare and even for apps available there it would need to check against the very same version such solution is hardly practical so while my arguments might differ my bottom line is almost the same as geffs only install from trusted sources while nothing is secure this imposes the smallest risks possible the highest risk is with pirated stuff as thats very likely to have bad things injected
54120 at any point in space the magnetic field strength and direction is the net effect of all the magnetic field sources affecting that point the earths magnetic field is one of them magnetized screwdrivers cars refrigerator magnets etc all produce fields fields are also produced by current flowing through wires its like pouring water into glass from multiple sources once its in the glass you cant tell where it came from there is no instrument that can determine the actual poles of the earth by measuring the magnetic field at point what the phone can do however is sense the point where the phone axis is parallel to the magnetic force line and determine which end of the phone is north pointing if you do your dance far away from objects that might be magnetized like cars and steel fences the field the phone is measuring may be primarily the earths field and hence the phone compass will be properly calibrated if you then put the phone into magnetized car however it will point the wrong direction for north the steel in every car is magnetized to one degree or another high precision compasses such are used on aircraft and serious maritime vessels actually have tiny correction magnets that are adjustable with screws for and errors they are calibrated after installation by turning the vehicle onto known headings compass rose painted by surveyor on taxiway far from metal buildings for example and fussing with the magnets until the compass error is minimized then the residual errors are recorded on compass correction card for use in correcting the indicated readings search compass correction card to see the images in theory the gps could be used to calibrate the compass when walking or driving since the instantaneous gps track is accurate have not heard of this being done though it possibly is common it would work even in magnetized car however in an airplane or ship this wouldnt work because the vehicles heading is to one degree or another usually crabbed slightly into the wind and the gps has no knowledge of this
54162 dont know whether tasker can meanwhile handle that itself but its at least doable with the right plugin theres locale nfc plugin which could fill this gap alternatives exist as well like modified version of anytag which is used in this tutorial for more examples tutorials and possibilities recommend googlefu ahem search for tasker nfc which brings up lot of tuts and even youtube videos explaining different magical things to achieve this way
54164 trigger can among other things run tasker tasks in any case its probably worth while to check out this app if you plan on experimenting with nfc tags
54541 installed the disk info app and in the options enabled expert mode and unmounted partitions it doesnt say swap but it shows clearly that its the only other partition on the sd card and its the right size so dev block mmcblk1p2 must be the one swapper is configured to use dev block mmcblk0p3 by default so im glad didnt go with the default

54822 fdisk works if you pass the whole disk device name explicitly fdisk dev block mmcblk1 what does not work is automatic discovery of block devices apparently because android places block device files under the dev block directory but fdisk expects to see those files directly in dev therefore one option is to collect the list of whole disk devices dev block mmcblk0 dev block mmcblk1 and look at their partition tables using fdisk device these whole disk devices are listed in proc partitions before the corresponding partitions the blkid utility does not look at the partition table at all it opens all block devices known by the system and detects the filesystem type from the actual data on those devices therefore blkid will not show correct information for the swap partition until that partition is initialized by mkswap this means that blkid is useless for your current task finding which partition should be passed to mkswap mount usually shows devices under dev block vold which are named according to their major and minor numbers to get the usual device name you can look in proc partitions to find row containing the same numbers in the first two columns then you can remove the number part from the end of the device name add dev block at the start and pass the resulting name to fdisk to see the partition table of the corresponding device beware that if you look at the fdisk output for the internal emmc flash you may find lots of partitions with strange types especially on qualcomm based devices see the partition table for samsung galaxy gt i8150 fdisk lu dev block mmcblk0 disk dev block mmcblk0 mb bytes heads sectors track cylinders total sectors units sectors of bytes device boot start end blocks id system dev block mmcblk0p1 win95 fat32 lba partition does not end on cylinder boundary dev block mmcblk0p2 4d unknown partition does not end on cylinder boundary dev block mmcblk0p3 unknown partition does not end on cylinder boundary dev block mmcblk0p4 extended partition does not end on cylinder boundary dev block mmcblk0p5 unknown dev block mmcblk0p6 unknown dev block mmcblk0p7 unknown dev block mmcblk0p8 unknown dev block mmcblk0p9 unknown dev block mmcblk0p10 4a unknown dev block mmcblk0p11 4b unknown dev block mmcblk0p12 unknown dev block mmcblk0p13 unknown dev block mmcblk0p14 unknown dev block mmcblk0p15 unknown dev block mmcblk0p16 unknown dev block mmcblk0p17 unknown dev block mmcblk0p18 unknown dev block mmcblk0p19 unknown dev block mmcblk0p20 unknown dev block mmcblk0p21 unknown dev block mmcblk0p22 9a unknown dev block mmcblk0p23 9b unknown dev block mmcblk0p24 9c unknown dev block mmcblk0p25 9d unknown dev block mmcblk0p26 9e unknown dev block mmcblk0p27 9f bsd os dev block mmcblk0p28 a0 thinkpad hibernation partition type codes there are even dangerously wrong because dev block mmcblk0p1 which is declared win95 fat32 lba actually contains some system data including locations and md5 hashes of various rom parts however dev block mmcblk0p28 which is the fat16 formatted internal data storage has type which looks completely bogus in this case the manufacturer did not reuse the 0x82 linux swap type code for their own purposes but im not sure that such collisions never occur so you should not blindly try to use any partition which looks like swap first check that the device size and partition layout are what you expect to see on your sd card proc mtd is never useful for finding swap partition on sd card mtd drivers are used to access directly attached raw flash chips they cannot work with external sd cards
54854 when coming from linux unix you may be confused because su root and that is also true on android but with small addition rooted android device has setuid root su binary to allow process to get root but the version typically used on android doesnt allow just any process to use it to get root it uses an android intent to communicate with an app superuser supersu to determine if the caller is allowed to get root the app then decides if its allowed typically with popup on the screen of the android device more details here https stackoverflow com questions how does android superuser app detect that an app requests root

55121 the definite answer is yes received my nexus few weeks ago and today went outside to catch few satellites im using gps status toolbox whose user guide states the sky grid shows the gps satellites above you as the receiver in the phone detects them gps satellites with ids are represented by small circles while glonass satellites with ids are shown as rectangles the size of the symbol depends on the signal strength received from that satellite the color shows what data is available for that satellite and how it is currently used by the phone emphasis mine heres the left side of the screen shot took the nexus model would be the european one if there are any differences
55292 this answer is not the hint you dear readers hoped for but the result of my real world tests adb backup is far from complete on nexus both under an unrooted stock android and if run with adb root on cyanogenmod few things are restored few not checked restoration of some features not restored basically all the key telephony features contacts sms ringtone notification sound activated input languages kbd layouts ownername ownername set in first boot wizard is kept instead properly restored custom vocabulary wallpaper launcher icon positions apps and their settings these were my requirements which brought me to the topic maximization of android privacy physical security to prevent drive by downloads pdf meaning bootloader locked stock recovery adb off even more secure with full disk encryption full local backup no cloud backup topic of this very thread here on cyanogenmod the situation was little different sms were completely restored but contacts and call logs still not restored even when adb backup and restore where ran with an adb running as root through adb root so will try to use custom rom with root to get some extra features locked bootloader custom recovery and only flash the recovery temporarily theoretically possible from the rooted device with flash image but for me this failed too from which then do nandroid backups or adb backup special backup solutions for sms call logs contacts plus custom rom updates

55590 had similar issue new device can install from google play but from the website it wasnt being shown as device under my settings what had to do was to go into settings apps google play on the device and then clear the data once that is done when you next launch play it will ask you to accept the terms and conditions then just downloaded an app any app will do on the device this seems to alert the web settings that theres another device then checked my settings on the play website and the device was now listed no delay it was there straight away note that never logged out of the browser or cleared any browser caches etc effectively the step are clear the google play app cache on the android device start play and accept cs download any app from inside the play app hopefully this will work for others too

55669 it is entirely possible for malicious app to become available through it however the same can be said for any other software distribution system the app store is not immune to sneaky devs either never assume that any software distributor offers safe software whether youre using windows osx ios android linux unix freebsd or any os the only person who should be responsible for your security is you yourself when installing software make sure that you trust the vendor and the app itself regardless of how much you trust the supplier if you trust rovio then angry birds is going to be just as safe on ios as it is on android or any other platform its available on
55670 we dont compare apples with peaches but its always good idea to be careful what you install true google play is to be considered one of the safest sources for android apps still some malware sneaks in every now and then so you should use some common sense before hitting the install button things to look at include but might not be restricted to what permissions are required though not always easy to decide there are some things which can count as indicators taking simple calculator app it certainly doesnt need access to your contacts calendars system settings etc how is it rated im not talking about naked numbers but check the comments they might give you useful hints on whether its safe to install also an app installed several thousands of times with no traces of maliciousness in the comments should be considerably safer than an app with almost no installs and no comments should it be very popular app but only has few installs thats in most cases clear indicator for malware hiding behind popular name better keep your hands off those aside of that in case youre still unsure pick good forum and ask another good idea is to check other apps from the same developer just follow the link on his name and use above criteria on them
55671 it is possible for there to be malicious apps on google play however there are number of things that you can do to protect yourself check the permissions that an app requests when installing if it looks excessive for what the app does then you can email the developer and ask why they need the permissions they ask for most developers should be happy to do this although it may take while to get response look at the amount of downloads and reviews if it doesnt have many downloads then be more cautious it does not however mean that the app is malicious just that you need to check more yourself if it has lot of star reviews then id probably stay clear as well if it is popular app such as need for speed riptide gp etc that is normally paid for app but you find free version then be very careful common tactic by malware authors is to pose as popular apps but actually they install malware on your device essentially you have to use common sense if in doubt dont install the app google does have system called bouncer which scans all apps uploaded to the play store which has reduced the amount of malicous apps but it is not guaranteed
55715 anyone who has any experience programming and working on both android and ios apps can tell you that there are most certainly malicious apps on the play store heres the deal in order to publish your app to apples app store you have to submit it to apple for review oh and you also have to pay them per year and jump through some other hoops either way apple goes through your apps code line by line or at least thats what they claim and verify there is not malicious code as lot of devs can tell you its not hard to get an app rejected and not all that uncommon to have to resubmit the end result is that the apple app store is about as safe as it gets not perfect but as far as safety it doesnt get much safer now if develop and app for android can basically just upload it to the play store will need to create developer account but thats all have to do if my app contains known viruses or malware google will eventually catch it and remove it from the app store the important thing to keep in mind about android is that it really is closer to windows in that you can easily mess around and download an app or apps that can steal your personal information slow your system down due to poor design or ads and any number of other things my best advice is to pay very close attention to an apps permissions and if in doubt just dont install it also even if you dont usually read reviews on ios devices would recommend that you at least take look at the reviews for any lesser known android app you are considering installing you can find out pretty quickly if the app has been causing other users problems with their devices for this reason would not recommend just indiscriminately downloading every single app that looks interesting on android you really should be savvy enough to pay attention and protect yourself in addition to programming have also worked for few years in the mobile industry and can tell that hated to see older users get androids because they would end up with so much crap on their phone and then wonder why it didnt work the way they wanted if this is you then you maybe you should go with apple if you dont mind paying attention to what you are doing then android will treat you very well hope this helps

55849 in reality mobile network internet providers predominantly use deep package inspection with uri fingerprinting to detect tethering it is the only method that is feasible to use for large scale operation they can use known sites the windows update server to detect that it is non phone device that is accessing or for http read web browser user agent to detect that the browser is for non phone platform having said this these methods have some significant limitations timing offset from start of use until detection can take minutes detection can be neutralised by using end user encryption using all possible fingerprinting techniques often result in triggering false positives so the reality is that tethering detection is balancing act from an operator perspective they typically only implement enough to be able to block regular non geek users which constitute the wast majority of mobile users deploying tighter detection to block tech savvy users is typically not worth the effort and may backfire by generating too many false positive events as long as they get paid for used data they will look the other way they rather concentrate their effort on hackers and blocking revenue leakage due to network exploits

57915 you cant use any apps like this any more because lots of apps abused the media mounted broadcast intent to cause rescan of the whole filesystem draining battery after they only changed one file kitkat has new restriction that only system apps can broadcast this intent apps that try will get securityexception which by default causes the has stopped dialog theres an alternative mechanism for an app to say that its changed particular file and cause that file to be rescanned not recursively but theres no replacement that scans whole filesystem because that would be abused in the same way and its up to the app to call this its not something you can change as user an app that used root would be able to make this work in the same way as and earlier but again it would need to be specifically written to request root rooting the device wouldnt make your old apps start working again for more technical details see how to trigger mediascan on nexus on stack overflow our sister site for programming questions

58408 cyanogenmod versus android to ask how cyanogenmod is different from android is comparable to ask how is cat different from an animal cyanogenmod is an android custom rom see our rom tag wiki for what rom is our custom rom tag wiki for details on custom roms our cyanogenmod tag wiki for details on cyanogenmod quoting the latter which quotes from the cyanogenmod website cyanogenmod is an aftermarket firmware for number of cell phones based on the open source android operating system it offers features not found in the official android based firmwares of vendors of these cell phones as youre asking about ecosystems cyanogenmod meanwhile is company there might be multiple ecosystems using the same resources as will be shown below google versus android versus cyanogenmod android is not google and google is not android behind android stands the aosp team so android is open source which is why other groups like cyanogenmod can use it the iron grip of your question doesnt go to android itself its rather the additions google puts on top the so called google apps see google apps and its tag wiki those apps are not open source but closed source cyanogenmod started shipping their own counter parts for several of the google apps and features and here youve got your ecosystem apps and services cyanogenmod is not permitted to ship the google apps with their roms you have to install them manually if you want them or leave them out there are many substitutes available so you can use android without google android os without google services can an android phone run without google guide how to use your android phone without google android without google discussion xda android without google how to do it can trust with my data google earns its money with advertisements if you can trust them with your data imho you can trust cyanogenmod even more if you dont want to trust either of them there are alternatives such as owncloud funambol and more which you can use with any rom cyanogenmod included setting up your own cloud as one of the names suggests concerning the google play store and where to get my apps from as with the other google apps custom roms are not permitted to bundle them with their distributions but there are lot of alternative and open source markets like droid etc see our alternative markets tag wiki there have been rumours about cyanogenmod app market but must have missed that taking off
58409 cyanogenmod is fork of aosp android open source project more customisable and with many added niceties see the why page on cms wiki for details one of the main advantages it that youre able to update phones for which its vendor stopped releasing updates for instance have cyanogenmod which is based on android jelly bean on my nexus google only updated android up to for this phone when you install it you dont have the google apps like maps hangouts search etc but you can install the gapps package which contains these apps

58833 in short its because of the different ways that android and ms windows are distributed ms windows is retail product sold directly to pc owners therefore microsoft is responsible for making it run on pcs pcs are standardized and nowadays have hardware discovery mechanism so microsoft can design the windows installer so that it can run on any pc compatible machine its in their interest to make drivers for old windows versions compatible with newer versions so that they can keep selling new windows versions to users theres also technical dimension to this phones arent just tiny arm pcs as you suggest the distinguishing thing about pc is that it satisfies the pc specification originated by ibm but now specified by an industry consortium there are several more standards for how components of pc interact and theyre what allows automatic driver configuration such as you find on desktop pc graphics cards offer vesa interface which allows graphics to be displayed before gpu driver has been configured all pc hardware nowadays offers plug play which allows the os to discover hardware and configure the memory map at boot before plug play you had to change physical jumpers on each pci card and then tell the software what memory range irq etc youd set on the jumpers and in the days before directx and its ilk you had to do that separately for every game that wanted to use that hardware plug play came about mostly so that sound card and other discrete component vendors could make easier to install hardware in contrast android isnt product thats sold to users its sold to device manufacturers phones also tablets stbs media players etc dont have anything like the pc specification so its not possible for google to make an android installer that can run on any device even displaying the battery animation when the phone is off requires it to load the linux kernel with framebuffer driver and battery driver its the device manufacturers responsibility to modify the android source code so that it can run on their device and the resulting android firmware image belongs to the manufacturer they dont have to give those changes to google or anyone else the phone world doesnt have these kinds of standards because theres no demand for it theres no one trying to sell phone components that you put together yourself no one in the phone industry is interested in making an os that you can install on any phone only the likes of ubuntu and mozilla who are outsiders with no contribution to hardware standards

60254 snoozy charger also in the play store takes care of this the free app as in beer and speech that lets you manage behavior during charger connection and disconnection it requires no permissions but does require you giving it device admin permissions these permissions are only used for to control device locking as verifiable in its source code from quickly going through the app source code it looks totally harmless and benign if the app does not behave as you want make sure to go through the settings for example turn off screen only when locked is enabled by default this means that the app will not kick into effect if you have an on off button press lock delay or other related settings it works perfectly for my on wireless charging pad and with micro usb cable using lg nexus device am very satisfied update documented additional issues here

60827 first turn on auto update in the main settings of the play store then you will have to manually open each app in the app store and un select auto update this will be painful task especially if you have more than handful apps tested on play store
60829 yes its possible but very time consuming open the google play store go to menu settings tap on the auto update apps and select one of the two auto update apps options to enable it go back then go to my apps section locate the app you want anti virus app that you mentioned and tap on it once now tap the menu button and the first option should be the auto update ensure the checkmark is present for this app for all other apps that you have installed you will need to follow steps and but this time disable the auto update setting by unchecking it

60895 the best explanation could find online people details is new sync service related to the recent release of google play games it was pushed to most if not all android devices recently its purpose is to tie you together across all google play services the separate services available from the google play screen the idea is to maintain uniform and unique identity for you in all related google games so that data from one can potentially be used to enhance the user experience in another the contact sync is for the usual contacts that user saves directly on your phone
60924 you can use android debug bridge adb shell to issue basic linux commands on your phone just like you would in terminal emulator app to install youll need to do the following on the phone go to settings about phone and tap on build number seven times this enabled developer tools go back to the main settings screen and you should now see developer options under the system section go to developer options enable android debugging option and then tap ok on the verification prompt on your pc download the android sdk tools from here you can either download the whole sdk or just the stuff necessary to connect to your phone which is on the same page under download for other platforms sdk tools only section install the tools you just downloaded download and install the usb drivers for your phone usually provided by the manufacturer re connect your phone to the pc with usb cable open command prompt assuming windows navigate to where you installed the sdk tools android sdk platform tools and type in the following adb devices if all of the above was done successfully prompt should pop up asking you to allow connections from this computer accept the pairing request and the prompt should show your phones id if this doesnt happen it usually means that the drivers arent installed correctly back at command prompt type in adb shell and press enter and you should be connected to the phones terminal this should get you started adb commands are listed on googles site here the shell provides some basic linux commands like ls cp etc be aware that most file and device management commands will require root elevated privileges which is separate topic
60930 alternatively to the adb variant described by chahk which requires at least minal installation of adb on your computer you can install ssh server app on your device examples include but are not restricted to ssh server digisshd servers ultimate then you can use the ssh command on linux mac or tool like putty on windows to connect to your device and run shell commands as if you were using terminal app on the device itself
60956 this has happened to me on several occasions mostly when backing up restoring wifi settings using an app such as titaniumbackup heres what recommend starting with the safest solutions first try going into the wifi settings and removing the problematic network while youre there you might as well remove any other unused networks https support google com android one answer change add or remove saved networks remove if that doesnt work the only remaining option that doesnt require root access is to delete all of your saved networks if you dont want to delete all of your saved networks and you have root access the wifi network settings are kept in text file data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf which can become corrupted ive been able to fix problems by manually editing the file turn off wifi if you leave it on the corrupted wifi settings may get rewritten back up data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf edit data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf and remove any problematic networks if youve made it this far and youre still having problems turn off your wifi and delete data misc wifi wpa supplicant conf of course this will delete all of your saved networks the file will be recreated the next time you turn on your wifi as last resort you can delete data misc wifi but dont recommend it if you do decide to do this make sure you back it up first the folder should be recreated on reboot with default settings then youll need to set your networks up again
61125 fixed it the trick was to clear the cache and data for google keyboard settings apps all google keyboard clear data clear cache be sure to go to all instead of running the instance under running will not give you the correct data clearing options
61214 long press on the word when you type it and see it above keyboard you will be given an option to delete it from learned words android
61303 had the same problem and asked google to help me this is their answer we use the billing address of your default payment instrument in google wallet to help determine your home country for accessing the play store our collection of content can vary by country so your view of the play store may differ from what others are seeing when you travel outside of the country listed on your default payment methods billing address please note that you must have valid payment method with billing address located inside country in order to access that countrys play store if youre having issues viewing your intended countrys play store and would like to change your default payment method or update an existing billing address in google wallet please use the following steps sign into your google wallet account to manage your payment methods https wallet google com manage paymentmethods add new card or change your default payment instrument to one with billing address located inside your desired country open the play store and navigate to any item available for download click to begin download until you reach the accept and buy screen no need to complete the purchase close the play store and clear data for the google play store application settings apps google play store clear data or clear your browser cache re open the play store you should now see the play store that matches your default payment instruments billing country if you havent yet added payment method to your account for the first time please add card directly from the play store with billing address that matches your intended country location then follow steps through to show your intended countrys play store
61544 short answer no long answer adb install is shortcut that is equivalent to open shell using adb shell and type pm install pmstand for package manager and his behaviour is the same as other package manager in other linux distributions like aptitude in debian or pacmanin arch linux except that pm doesnt fetch package from distant location the play store is an application like others and we cant call android applications like we call program like or normal java program because the apk file isnt actually binary but simply zipped package it is the dalvik virtual machine sort of equivalent to the java vm that deals with running applications the play store application simply download the application you want and then run pm install on the package downloaded
61651 answer was using the cable that samsung provided with the phone solution go get usb miniusb cable that was provided with digital slr few years back and use that instead the s4 now appears in the adb output and in kies just fine sarcasm thankyou samsung sarcasm
61819 this behaviour depends on the application you use and so on the way developers programmed their applications the application may provide an option to use enter as send but if it doesnt then think you cant do much about this
61959 the answer to your question most likely relates to this question how do change the google play country it details what you should do but read through the whole thing because the first answer requires you to make purchase but the second says how to do it without making purchase
61992 re install these official samsung drivers uninstall current drivers by going into device manager make sure to check off the delete drivers option if given reboot reinstall the given drivers above without connecting the galaxy s4 reboot go ahead and connect phone and verify that in device manager samsung adb device or equivalent is shown if it shows an exclamation mark on it or other problem then in device manager right click on the driver update let me choose from list and choose the correct android adb driver
62225 even if it would be doable consider few things making it extremely unlikely in that early stage the touchscreen is not yet initialized so how would you input your pin password pattern to unlock the bootloader before firing up the custom recovery another risk introduced this way if you break your display you are effectively knocked out even if the problem described above could be worked around that work around would be rendered useless at this place true there are things like touch based custom recoveries so technically that would be the place to make it possible once the recovery is initialized it could ask for code to unlock before offering its real services this might even include fallback mode for broken screen using shake patterns accelerometer based or nfc if applyable but thats nothing we can solve here at this site you will have to contact the resp developers for this twrp and or clockworkmod to name two examples
62302 try using vpn and google play store mail address set to the region you want to download an app from created one specially for this purpose successfully set up free one day trial vpn using an android app then fired up the google play store and installed the apps that wanted then uninstalled the vpn app which disabled the vpn now ive got the apps that wanted and am able to use them in my region aside the content these apps serve up dutch video is available in my region through the web browser and when there are restrictions the apps and the web browser respect the geographic restrictions so really dont get why these apps are region restricted
62393 setting this option forces android to stop each process as soon as it is empty that is when no services are started and no activities are on screen for that app to be clear this option wont stop apps that would normally run in the background from doing so your mail client will still run periodically to check mail if its configured to do that apps that use google cloud messaging to receive push messages from internet servers such as gmail and facebook will still be able to do so the option would be better named cached background process limit since it limits apps that would otherwise show up with that label in the apps manager next time each app needs to start android has to load the app from storage from scratch this uses more power and takes longer than running it again when the process was in memory this doesnt just mean when you start an activity from that app deliberately it also means the email client has to be loaded afresh each time it wants to check email over time this can build up to huge battery drain because this is development option it can also trigger rare bugs in certain apps and those apps developers may not be keen to fix them one example is that on nexus devices running when this option is on the in built calendar app will keep restarting itself with this option set because stopping the cached background process causes the calendars content provider to be removed which causes loop of services restarting each other to check for calendar updates if this happens the loop will run down your battery very quickly
62651 there is way to do this based on the xposed module installer this requires rooted device as per this thread tapping on the status bar will bring the scroll to the top it started out originally based on thread in reddit where this user blogged about her experience after ditching apple for android and one of the things the user found troublesome was there was no way for android to scroll to top one of the devs that is regular on the xposed scene developed the module to circumvent it
62989 in short if you want to flash kitkat android youll have to upgrade to version of cwm greater than v6 or use an alternate bootloader for the galaxy tab gt p5113 or gt p5110 you can find the instructions here
63173 its chip soldered to the main board in the phone you can only remove it by desoldering it from the board in soldering oven this is precisely temperature controlled device kitchen oven wont do even if you did manage to desolder it safely the chip itself isnt lot of use to you because its an internal component it doesnt fit into standard reader like an sd card does so youd have to either try to solder it into different phone which might still not work if anything on the chip is specific to the old phone or find the specs and build new board to fit it
63174 this may not be as easy as you think the emmc is connected to the board with ball grid array bga connection which is pretty difficult to reconnect once removed you can see photos of the chip and more discussion on the topic on this xda post as for where the chip is you might be able to find it on some teardowns but my eyes didnt catch it in ifixits photos

63636 the first problem is space most phone until recently have too little storage space to contain the entire generic kernel and android framework compounding issue is that phone hardware is generally more variant and less standardized than pc hardware which can be unavoidable due to the limited space the other problem is that there no single standard for flashing method among stock boot loaders with pc you have the standard booting from cd and booting from usb drive method in the standard external drive booting method the pc is the usb host but android generally acts as usb client this is also reflected in the choice of cables the android side of the usb cable is usually usb micro and most external drives also use usb mini this means the physical connection requires you to get usb micro to usb micro cable which is relatively uncommon finally the last problem is political manufacturers and carriers have no incentives to change the status quo only very small minority of users are going to flash their device which will usually void warranty they have no incentive to encourage people to install boot loader that makes it easy to void warranty and which often cause support nightmare
63654 besides the points mentioned in lie ryans answer there is one big issue people tend to underestimate drivers remember windows most people remember it as bad and unstable os why was it unstable because the drivers came in the beginning not from microsoft but from the hardware manufacturers and some most of them where of poor quality crashing the whole system of course the user in front of the pc blamed the os because that was what appeared to be crashing and not the driver writing hardware drivers is not an easy task you have to know the os api you have to know the hardware you have to know the computer architecture and if you just make little mistake the most os these without good isolation will crash lets have look at the other open source operating systems most of them comes with superior architecture and use more hardware features then linux then why doesnt everybody use them id say its because they lack drivers why should choose os that doesnt support my wifi hardware now lets have look at the target platform about you are wondering why there is no install medium available android devices are highly specialized and use hardware that is not available to the masses you cant usually but the sound chip used in typical android device need driver that are proprietary only the hardware manufacturer has access to the source of the driver is manifold that makes is hard to compose an install medium that works for every or even most devices the usually approach to install gnu linux on an android device is to use the available environment bootloader kernel incl drivers libc this avoids all the issues mentioned in the answers
63751 according to post in google product forum sync between nexus devices and facebook isnt possible by default to get that information on your phone you will need to install third party application that will sync the information to your phone manufacturers like htc and samsung enabled this on their own for the people that bought their devices an alternative to make this sync happen is to use 3rd party app like sync me sync for facebook full screen caller id see your friends picture from facebook linkedin or vkontakte when they call you and when you call them smart matching matches automatically between your contacts to their social network profiles contact enrichment magically update your contacts with missing details phone number email company job title address website in call experience take your phone calls to the next level view your friends latest social network posts and photos during call birthday reminders never forget your friends birthdays again create and share personalized greetings for any occasion me card your ultimate contact and business card choose how you appear in your friends and colleagues phones edit your picture and details to keep them updated
63761 dont use the phone dialer app to edit contacts use the main people app its called contacts on some non nexus phones from that app when you click the contact you want it displays that contact and you can click the pencil icon on the action bar at the top to edit the contact the icon might look different on your phone because most manufacturers replace the people app with their own variant
63898 did some digging around and found that this change was introduced in an update for gingerbread it applies to all nexus devices starting from the nexus except the nexus one since it comes pre installed with facebook the problem google has with facebook sync is the inability to port the data that facebook sync adds to the contacts out of your device here is an excerpt from their statement on this issue since facebook contacts cannot be exported from the device the appearance of integration created false sense of data portability facebook contact data will continue to appear within the facebook app like all developers on android facebook is free to use the android contacts api to truly integrate contacts on the device which would allow users to have more control over their data we are removing the special case handling of facebook contacts on nexus and future lead devices techcrunchs coverage on this http techcrunch com google android facebook contacts engadgets coverage http www engadget com google disables contact sync in facebook for android only nexus am still trying to find the official statement on google site will update it here if find it also want to know why google doesnt get all manufacturers to enforce this rule if it is part of core android policies
63958 the trick is to click the image not the remainder of the item to be able to edit it
64364 thats done easiest using adb see the adb tag wiki for details on what adb is and how to get install it on your machine as you dont state the os youre using on your desktop write how it could be done on linux which work with should be easily adaptable to other platforms put all your downloaded apk files into single folder connect your android device and make sure its recognized adb devices should list connected device open terminal command prompt and change to the directory where your apk files reside run for file in apk do adb install file done watch all the apps getting installed without requiring any further interaction note if you have apk files which have spaces in their names such as xposed framework adobe flash player etc then you will have to rename them as adb cannot handle that either remove the spaces altogether or replace them by underscores linux provides perl script for that usr bin rename which you can use rename apk it replaces all space character with which makes names like this xposed framework adobe flash player which are recognizable by adb
64564 qrcopy is free app that lets you share your clipboard between your pc and nearly any other device it uses qr codes to transfer information so it works on any device that has qr code reader the windows version includes fast qr code reader that works using your webcam and it has mobile app that runs on most other devices once you have some text in your clipboard you just press windows and it pops up in an onscreen qr code ready for you to scan using your mobile to send text back to your pc you use its qr code generator on your mobile to copy your text to qr code then on your pc you just press windows and it will fire up your webcam and use it to read the qr code on your mobile device it only takes second or two and it works in any program http www qrcopy net disclaimer am friend of the guy who created qrcopy
64583 you can try pushbullet app also requires the chrome extension for windows its includes universal copy and paste currently only supported on android and windows to enable the feature youll have to go to the advanced settings on each device you want to sync once you turn it on copying text on one device will automatically send it to the clipboard of all the others the developers state theyre working on adding ios and os support but for now it works pretty well between android and windows devices
64695 no ill even go to the extent of saying using an antivirus is of no use if you only install apps from google play but if you install apps from third party sources apks etc using an antivirus might actually make sense but using avs doesnt make sense in any scenario imho
64714 known issue with running avs is that theyll consider each other as potential virus this has to do with the behaviour of these programs they scan directories perform root operations if you have installed the av on rooted device and so on this is true on any system not only mobile devices you can in most cases run an av together with an anti malware product do say in most cases as mentioned by karan there is no real need for av software as long as you only run google play appstore apps and you dont download any rubbish from sites you visit do keep in mind that there are some dangerous apps on google play im an android user myself definitly no ifanboy and must admit not all play apps are safe so always check the permissions and intentions of an app before installing it myself have avast mobile security on my tablet this is because run some off the market apps ms also allows me to protect some apps with pincode such as my email apps dont think running an av is waste of resources but if you handle your device with care there is no real need for one
64805 the apk is the app installing an app on someones phone is itself giving them the apk so its nonsense to talk about installing the app without giving them the apk its analogous to asking if you can run program on windows machine without giving them the exe file if you instead want to install an app on someones phone without them being able to copy the app to different phone the author of the app needs to use an anti piracy library licensing service to stop the app when its run on an unauthorized phone as programming questions are off topic on this site wont discuss that further
64864 provided you have physical access to the device you can manually install your app by doing the following install android sdk tools from this page download for other platforms sdk tools only install usb drivers for the phone usually from manufacturers site turn on usb debugging on the phone in settings developer options connect the phone via usb you can also do this over wi fi with number of apps if the phone is rooted open command prompt or terminal and navigate to the platform tools sub directory of where you installed the sdk tools issue the following command adb install path to apk your app apk keep in mind though that you are still essentially letting them have the apk since the installation simply copies the apk file to the appropriate directory on the phone usually data app or data app private and registers it with androids package manager knowledgeable enough user can still retrieve the apk
65242 the user44860 answer is almost correct goto settings about phone software information click build number times you should see message saying that now youre developer so you can go back and enabe usb debugging in the development settings maybe youve to detach the usb cable enable the debug and re plug the usb cable
65459 well if you phone is rooted you can run commands with the su command here is an example of cat command on the build prop file to get phones product information adb shell su cat system build prop grep product this invokes root permission and runs the command inside the notice the end quotes that is required that you close all your end quotes or you will get an error for clarification the format is like this adb shell su your command goes here make sure you enter the command exactly the way that you normally would when running it in shell give it try hope this helps
65558 android phones have at least fingers in the pot that iphones do not the hardware maker and the network carrier the hardware makers often consider their drivers trade secrets and therefore must learn the new versions code and then adapt their drivers manufacturers also often provide custom skins that must be updated for the new version and sometimes wholly redesigned any changes must then be approved by the carriers they often addon their own features which must be updated redesigned and tested then they must run networks tests for each phone to ensure it wont crash the network while these tests must go on for iphones also they are probably done before the new version is released as apple can produce all the phones running the new version at once for testing before the code is released to even developers
65578 think there are number of reasons why updates are so slow for android devices the time it takes manufacturer to apply their customisations to the new version and ensure everything works ok can be quite long this has improved over the last year or so as google give them an android pdk or the platform development kit which should allow them to work on their customisations several months in advance of the public even hearing about the next version of android the time it takes for networks to test the update and apply their customisations there is little incentive for manufacturers to apply the update especially on year old devices as they are trying to sell their newest devices to customers most customers dont know or care what version of android is on their device so why would the manufacturer spend time and money updating the device to the latest version you can also look at this article which goes into bit more detail including why apple is able to release updates so much quicker essentially because they control both the hardware and software
65580 this is part question part asks why android phones do not get the newest update right away and has been answered adequately by the other answers part asks why older phones often never get the newest update and has not been answered yet as lebeau says there are other corporate stakeholders besides google google only creates the new versions and besides the phones it directly creates like the nexus line it does not get much say over whether and when the others put them into the phones also like lebeau says all these other stakeholders have to learn the new version before they can implement it this is why the phones get new versions later and why certain phones like the nexuses get the versions before anyone else because google has already learned the new version as for part the hardware makers want us to keep buying new phones every couple months right otherwise how will they keep all that dough rolling in if we keep using our old phones theyd be in the same position the computer companies are in with storage and ram enough for any purpose why buy any new hardware the answer is to stop updating old phones so if we want the newest features we have to get new one google probably doesnt do this as much as it is already selling you android so why does it need to sell you phones but it probably does it little bit the network carriers for their part probably help with their draconian rules like preventing rooting or else you void your warranty this is why as you say july android is basically paperweight as for your comment about improvements being mainly userland dont know how all that works but im sure its not that simple the upgrades may be in software but not all software talks to the user plus the hardware makers put skins on our phones so we do not see the inner workings and its likely that when they finally upgrade to the newest version they put some new stuff in themselves so that an htc one phone at android is different from samsung galaxy siv phone at android probably either htc or samsung throws some new features out to put in and you do not even notice they did it then when lets say the htc one does not upgrade to but the htc two does im making this up you are forced to get htc two to get some of the new features of as well as some features of you didnt get with htc one am not certain this happens but it is normal business procedure so would not be surprised
65587 see this image released by htc it describes the update process in very detailed form image resized click to see the full size
65611 the only way found was to restart the device be careful to not switch to other users after the restart once you switch to another user his processes are initiated and continue working even if you switch back to your user just like you said in the question strange that google havent tackled this issue perhaps on newer android version this happens to me on my asus memo pad with android
65926 if you have multiple users on your tablet this means that the apps are installed by another user and therefore take up space without being installed under your user account just open the other accounts and uninstall the apps from there
65929 in the menu there is an option to uninstall for all users so you dont have to loging in to each user on the main
66194 it depends on how the particular recovery you will choose to install handles user data most recent versions of commonly used recovery images twrp and clockworkmod recognize the need to keep certain portions of internal memory on devices without removable storage on such devices the sdcard mount point is still present but is pointing to data media partition instead when doing regular factory reset this data media partition is left untouched if you really wish to clear that area as well in clockworkmod recovery for example you would need to navigate to mounts and storage and use the format data and data media sdcard option
66252 if you root the phone go into manage apps and you can disable the dialer it will remove it from the home page contacts can also be disabled there are also numerous ways to put the phone in airplane mode so its persistent after restart click image for larger version note disabling dialer does not disable the emergency dialer but airplane mode does
66253 on rooted devices you can disable the following packages to disable all telephony features phone dialer telephonyprovider contacts contacts storage contactsprovider depending on the device manufacturer and os version some of these apps might not exist or be named differently
66298 terminology is important in this case formatting data will wipe out your internal sdcard mount wiping data on the other hand will usually not erase your sdcard usually you dont need to actually format data and wiping usually called factory reset will suffice technical explaination sdcard lives in data media when doing factory reset the recovery will delete everything in data except for data media in fact when factory resetting my recovery will tell me wiping data skipping data media however when formatting you cannot be selective like that formatting will wipe out everything on mount point

67123 doubt that there is direct correlation between battery consumption and ram usage the hardware doesnt know which ram cells contain used data and which not so there can be no difference in battery consumption on that level but think that one could say that unnecessarily killing apps causes few extra cpu cycles when those apps have to be re started and therefore uses more battery and yes you definitely should let go of your app killing habit in most cases android is capable of managing the systems resources quite well and you shouldnt bother with manually killing apps they definitely wont drain more battery if they just idle around and consume some ram of course if those apps are constantly using the cpu they will drain battery but this is usually sign of bug within the app or badly implemented app
67129 think of ram like paper notebook you can write data into the book with pencil and you can erase those data and replace them with new data but the books always the same weight the book doesnt get any heavier whatever you write in it the same way with current ram technology the battery use of the ram is fixed regardless of what if anything is stored in it from androids point of view it doesnt matter whether you leave an app with the home button or the back button pressing the back button doesnt kill an app or remove it from ram swiping an app out of the recent apps list doesnt kill the app or remove it from ram the only difference it makes is changing what the app shows you next time you launch it the screen you were on before or the main first screen of the app imagine you have notebook as before and big bookcase with lots of reference books you cant carry the reference books around with you so if you need to know about subject you have to copy the information out of reference book into your little notebook when you run out of space in the notebook you use your eraser to wipe some information you dont need again so you can copy more information into it all this copying is tiresome so once youve copied some information you want to keep it in your notebook for as long as you think you might need it you keep track of what information in the notebook youre using right now and what information you use often and what information you havent used for while when you want to make space first you erase the information you havent used for while if you havent got any of that left then you erase some information you use often but not right now only if youre really desperate for space maybe theres one big subject that takes the whole notebook do you erase the information youre using today this is exactly what androids doing with your ram the big bookcase with reference books is like your phones internal storage you cant use it directly because the books are printed not written with pencil so its expensive it takes time and energy to copy data into your notebook ram to work on task manager app is like schoolteacher who thinks your notebook looks untidy with all those pages of notes youre not using any more the schoolteacher comes along every so often and erases whole pages of notes this is unnecessary because it doesnt make the book any easier to carry around the book weighs the same regardless not only that the schoolteacher doesnt know which information you use most often he might have vague idea but he doesnt know as well as you do so sometimes when he erases information the cost is an extra trip to the bookshelf which you wouldnt have needed otherwise thinking about it this way its easy to answer your question using more ram doesnt use any more power directly task manager app can make you use more power because youre having to copy things from internal storage to ram that you wouldnt have had to otherwise in the same way single ram hungry app costs you twice first you have to write all of that apps information in the notebook and then when you finish with it theres lot of information that you had to erase to make space which you have to copy from the bookshelf again
67162 there is now new attack that targets wireless networks and devices connected to them simply connecting to corporate wireless network one that uses eap for security is enough if you are running vulnerable version of android however it is unlikely dont quote me on this that they will be able to retrieve anything particularly sensitive from your android device with this method maybe your wireless connection password you can use detection tool more info to check if you have vulnerable system openssl lib on your device note that as lars duesing mentions its possible that specific apps are statically linked against vulnerable versions different from the system library according to this comment on reddit certain versions of android are affected by this bug worse still some browsers especially the built in one and chrome possibly use it and are therefore vulnerable android r1 upgraded openssl to version https android googlesource com platform external openssl git android r1 android r1 switched off heartbeats https android googlesource com platform external openssl git android r1 that leaves android vulnerable quick grep on my access logs reveal there is lot of devices still running some other sources indicate that is also vulnerable it seems the easiest way to fix it is to upgrade off that version if possible if youre lucky your carrier will release new version but wouldnt count on it if not you may have to investigate custom roms possibly downgrade or rooting and manually replacing the library it is highly recommended that you resolve this issue this bug can result in the theft of data including usernames and passwords from your browser by malicious server
67238 the best way know using cm11 as reference is to go to settings backup reset and removing the checkmark next to auto restore it may be under another heading on different roms so you may need to look around for it it is best to do this before you do the factory reset
67239 if youve already allowed google backup to backup your apps then changing settings before you do the factory reset wont make any difference after the factory reset when you next start the device itll go through the first time setup steps again where it guides you through connecting to wi fi network and signing into google account on the screen where you sign into your google account theres checkbox there to automatically restore your apps and data onto this device forget the exact wording uncheck the checkbox at this point and no apps or data will be restored to your device youll still be able to install any paid apps you previously bought if you later turn on google backup on this device itll start fresh set of backup data once it has backed up to this fresh set next time you factory reset this device the restore will be from this fresh set if you factory reset again before making any changes or before its had chance to back up youll still get the old set
67279 apologies for resurrecting an old thread but just had the same problem of needing to stop download and solved the problem by activating aeroplane mode less invasive solution and more easily reached in the ui for anyone else ending up here from google like did
67287 short hint maybe some apps use their own openssl libs or parts thereof that may open problems on any os version and google is aware of the problem their official statement says that only android was vulnerable all versions of android are immune to cve with the limited exception of android patching information for android is being distributed to android partners
67311 as of version tethering has been included in afwall you should only need to enable tethering dhcp dns services
67482 you can upload the package to mobile sandbox to see what its doing the sandboxes will execute the binary and you can see the execution resutls this will also work for some formerly unknown malware as it doesnt have to be in some av database before examples for sandboxes are mobilesandbox copperdroid sanddroid tracedroid joe sabdox mobile forsafe and others as always there is no security but then again there is no complete security when downloading from play store either virustotal that has been mentioned above recently started to run some samples in sandbox as well and is of course always good bet as it tests against magnitude of already known malware similar service as virustotal but specifically for android is andrototal
67513 if youre getting storage space runout on your samsung s2 phone just dial on the tablet and select option delete dumpstate logcat its not necessary to root your android restart your phone afterwards

68246 daydream doesnt trigger if phone is switched off by button
68450 dont know what it is but also just had it pop up an hour ago as you said persistent between apps and screens but goes away on landscape orientation am on moto dev running eclipse edit it seems to be feature added by the latest update from lastpass http blog lastpass com lastpass adds biometric security on html edit have just been stopping the floating fingerprint overlay service when it appears for now until last pass fixes the issue
68466 yup so the ios version just was updated for fingerprinting and some genius at last pass must have used the code on the android version as well giving us this awful useless gray brick brutal the second deleted last pass which really cant do permantely or would be screwed the box went away
68614 according to the mozilla firefox release notes they have completely removed the send tab to remote device feature you can use pushbullet its an android app that helps you to view android notifications on the pc and you can also push files pages urls from the android app to the pc todo install the pushbullet app on your phone install the pushbullet extension in your browser supports chrome and firefox
68618 sorry for the trouble this is causing you we initially removed the feature because we didnt know how well it was being used and the ux around it seemed confusing we intended to improve the feature and release it again soon that said with feedback like yours and many others we are reconsidering the decision and will try to get version of the feature back in firefox as soon as possible you can track some of the discussion here https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgiid
69010 looking at teardown of the new nexus it looks to be near the center again here you can see in the photo the nfc is under the inductive charging ifixit did pretty good teardown of it here which may give you more detail
69011 from google support if youre using nexus and touching its back to another device make sure the other device is near the in nexus to successfully beam content beam in this quote is referring to android beam androids name for nfc content transfer
69047 dual sim standby if you are talking in sim when someone calls to sim then they will hear sim is not reachable you wont get prompted dual sim active if you are talking in sim when someone calls to sim then they will hear your call is on waiting you will get prompted and you can place the current call in hold and answer the new call but you should be able to receive call or make calls on both sim when you use internet gsm arena confirms xperia tipo is no dual standby meaning when you are using one sim to make phone call using data the other sim gets off however unlike many dual sim phones in xperia tipo both the sim slot supports 3g sim
69053 there are actually three types of dual sim phones dual sim standby dss only one sim can be used at time radio chip the phone has single imei number dual sim dual standby dsds two sims can be used at time but if one opens call or data connection the other is offline the phone has two different imei numbers dual sim active or sometimes dual sim dual active dsa dsda two sims can be used at time radio chips this enables both sims to open calls and or data connection the phone has two different imei numbers since your phone is mentioned as no dual standby it means its dss phone which allows only one open connection at time
69081 before you place call there is backspace symbol to the right of the numbers that youve entered that you can use to delete any of the numbers that youve already entered however once youve actually rung number and started call the backspace disappears and you cant delete numbers as in your screenshot in the question the reason for this is that while youre making call the numbers that you type in are instantly transmitted down the phone line as dtmf or touch tone signals so that you can navigate through voicemail menus phone menu trees eg press for billing press for complaints dial extension numbers etc you cant delete dial tone thats already been transmitted this is the same as while youre in the middle of one phone call you cant just type numbers into the dialler and start totally different phone call so the dialer code that you typed in to try to show your sim message number wouldnt work because the numbers and symbols would have been transmitted down the phone line as beeps while you typed them possibly annoying the person on the other end instead of being used as service code instruction by the phone
69194 look to etc directory usually it is placed in system partition which you can mount as rw ls etc lrwxrwxrwx root root jan etc system etc su mount remountrw system chmod system etc for adb push some above steps may be replaces with adb root adb remount and later remount ro chmod system etc mount remountro system now your task to find executable or rc file which you modify to achieve your goal find etc type perm find etc name rc find etc name init grep data etc grep system etc google about each candidate to get know how this file was used good candidate for including custom scripts are lines from grep service init rc as each device unique you may need to do own guess about search criteria for example found etc mkshrc which used by korn shell update this file to extend path env var and now each time do adb shell have busybox symlinks in my path see also hard way if you have no luck with finding magic file https stackoverflow com questions make persistent changes to init rc

69397 go to google dashboard and sign in with the same google account you used on your phone click the arrow next to android to see list of all your devices with backup data at the bottom is button delete backup data this button deletes the backed up data from all devices theres no way to delete the data from specific device if you want to delete not only the data backed up using the back up my data to google servers option but also other synced data like gmail contacts calendars google docs documents youll find them listed in their own sections on the same dashboard page

69964 more than two years have passed since this question was asked still theres no official solution available despite its promises apefs introduced in my previous answer over year ago has not returned so decided to create my own solution for almost years now maintain listings of android apps by purpose grouped by their use cases in march started moving them to my own server all metadata are stored in database on that server and so finally was able to setup search by permissions search mask to find apps by category and permission click image for larger variant you can select between and categories here note that selecting parent category automatically includes all its children plus one or more permissions default presets are for finding permission friendly apps so if youre after such candidate you can simply submit the form after having made described selections this should make it easy to find pim app which does not request the internet permission to keep your personal data on your device however the opposite is possible as well if you want to investigate what good nfc can do for you select the up to categories youre interested in then the nfc permission switch the permissions dropbox to include and optionally the sorting to by rating descending to get the best rated apps first when in doubt theres that little question mark icon in the top right corner providing you with some online help but thats not all as ive explained in the second paragraph apps in my lists are grouped by their purpose what you need them for so apps with comparable functionality should appear next to each other category with app details source the help page hence the red numbers click image for larger variant so you can compare them not only by rating but also pick the one requesting less permissions number in the box in above image indicated by red or if possible without any concerns no red border around the box clicking the apps name reveals some more details as shown and there are many easter eggs mouseover events again be pointed to the help page full disclosure as initially indicated the described site was designed by me built by me filled by me with its content and is further maintained by me its available bi lingual english german free of any charge this includes no cookies flash cookies whatever etc this question here at android se was one of the reasons ive set it up further be aware of the fact that this doesnt cover the entire playstore collection as of today there are little over apps recorded in the database which is probably little less than of whats on play unless you dont count the crap fakes and useless apps on play then my records might cover about still hope and think its already useful resource youll enjoy
70021 this might be new feature of newer versions of android im using but can easily mass install apps from the play store how to mass install apps with the play store open the play store go to my apps go to all keep your finger pressed on an app that has not been installed yet for second or so now the play store goes into selection mode you can simply select all the apps you want and press the install button at the top when you re done
70228 go to settings storage and tap on the overflow menu in the top right on device with physical menu key you may need to press that instead this should bring up menu item labeled usb computer connection tap on that and it will give you list with possible connection modes uncheck everything that you dont intend to use on my n5 cm11 there are only two options on this page mtp and ptp unchecking both causes the phone to simply charge when plugged into pc have seen others that have an explicit charge only option but believe that is nonstandard
72856 yes it can but only on android and lower this is used for example in whatsapp when you activate the app whatsapp sends an sms to the number you reported and the app intercepts it quietly and reports to the servers that it has received the sms this is how the account is tied to your number of course this can be used in harmful apps also if an app registers as an sms receiver with the highest priority the app can listen for incoming smss process them and either dismiss them without the user ever noticing or forward to the next sms listener with the second highest priority this has been redone in android and if understood correctly only the default sms app has access to all incoming sms sms deliver action and the other apps with correct permissions will only receive notification of the incoming message sms received action in addition the sms received intent is non abortable it cant be stopped assume that in android this is done to allow the user to see all incoming sms messages in the default app edit found some more useful info on the android developers blog id test this further but my only android phone is currently wifi only so no sms
72858 as things stand android and below without hangouts app any app with sms receive permission can read abort an incoming sms ala whatsapp android and below with hangouts sms mode turned on any app with sms receive permission can read but not abort an incoming sms android and above any app with sms receive permission can read but not abort an incoming sms in all three cases read sms will give the app permission to read all the smss not just new incoming smss as onik mentioned things have change quite bit in android

73435 mythbusted installed this app yesterday with some uncertainty and it detected and fixed number of problems then found this thread which made my suspicions even more so today ran the app and it detected zero problems not surprising since the battery presumably got no new problems overnight out of curiosity set the date to month in advance and ran the test again and suddenly there are eight cells with low charge and two inactive so obviously all this app does is check when it was last run and the longer ago it was the more faulty cells it throws up in random pattern to make it look like its found faults which it can then fix dont waste your time assume the only thing this does is provide ad revenue to the developer

74705 aptoide serves bunch of repositories in apt style which some of you might know from debian and its derivates they also have their own android client used to access search and install apps from them for checking available apps any web browser can be used as well simply point it to aptoide com according to wikipedia they serve more than different apps with over billion downloads in over stores as of aptoide app for android source aptoide click images for larger variants often associated with black markets and other unsafe sources thats not what it is by default like peer to peer exchanges are not and like youtube isnt though you easily can find pirated content there paulo trezentos co founder of aptoide kindly pointed out several details behind aptoide in his answer on how safe is it to use aptoide and even more in mail he sent to me some core points like google play aptoide actively scans its repositories for malware theyre using different malware scanners doing signature checks and having implemented chain of trust based in the signature of the developers they work with several universities and research centers to make and keep the environment as safe as possible they use trust stamp to mark apps theyve thoroughly checked see the now archived 1000contest if you see that on the page for an app you can consider it safe according to paulo privacy is considered high value aptoide is very cautious about the way they internally handle the user private information their apps store is manually curated so when looking for way to stay as safe as possible with all those hundred thousands of repositories this would be the place all the app links in this post point there but even towards all the other repos paulo states we have responsibility to assure that the apps in those stores do not harm the end user in his mail to me paulo concluded believe we still can do better which to me indicates they dont settle on what they have achieved but try to continually improve if you additionally consider theres company behind the stores which recently even filed an antitrust complaint against google that should be sufficient to deviate from associating aptoide with black markets and piracy any more than youtube but rather consider it good alternative or supplement to other android app markets there are some more advantages worth mentioning you can have your own repository there whether private or public their aptoide uploader helps you upload your apps there you can use private repository to automatically backup your apps their aptoide backup apps is your helper for that you can schedule installs updates comes in handy when youre on mobile data and just found bigger app youd prefer installing on wifi just mark it and when on wifi toggle the scheduled installs see third screenshot above try that with google play example of untrusted app detection aptoide warns an application might be malicious source aptoide click image for larger variant couple of things to see here the little yellow exclamation mark with the red warning title is visible immediately details below are displayed when show was clicked anti malware checks have been run against this package one of them the aptoide specific malware guard the signature was found suspicious for multiple reasons it is not known to aptoide as trusted signature aptoide maintains chain of trust for signatures comparable to pgp gpg it was used elsewhere to sign another developers package and moreover that developers signature was known to aptoide so that was re sign possibly introducing hack of some kind some information on the anti malware checks is included at the end of the box
74813 thank you for raising these questions here is some information about aptoide that hope is useful for you and the stackexchange android community malware is something that we take very seriously currently we have different systems to detect malware as they arrive in any aptoide powered app store we run different anti virus in emulators in run time we have an in house system of signatures to detect recurring threats we have implemented chain of trust based in the signature of the developer the task of creating safe environment to the end user is moving target we are working with several universities and research centres and in recent article not yet published we compare well with the other app stores we also proposed european research project with anti virus companies and universities research centres to deal with this topic there is lot of work to be done and the feedback of the community is important droid is in fact very similar to aptoide they are fork of aptoide and they maintain all the concepts we developed like multiple stores they have more centralised approach and central signature which if of course different from our approach at aptoide we have the trusted stamp if you see the trusted stamp in an app we are certain that the app doesnt contain threat to the end user best paulo trezentos aptoide co founder
75061 in android etc etc its called media storage the one you clear the defaults of ya did just actually go through the whole list and pick it out of all of them and omfg it worked hey sorry im late but people seem to be clicking these defaults and not knowing how to clear them like me then they go and search for it and nobody knows im actually kind of thankful that it wasnt something more difficult to find so there you go media storage on samsung galaxy s2 android
75383 there are several apps specialized on this topic the probably best known is appmonster which use in the pro version for years now very reliable and very active dev for alternatives and more details please take look at are apk files saved on my device when install from the play store izzyondroid app lists backups backup apps
75436 very easy way is es file explorer from google play store you can browse to your system app folder for system apps data app folder for user apps requires root to be accessed and copy them to your sdcard or anywhere else copying multiple files with es file explorer is very easy just long hold one of the files then put check marks on all the files you want to copy then browse to the folder on your sdcard where you want to place them connecting to your computer via your usb cable will allow you to backup your sdcard content to your computer update accessing the protected data apps area notice the data directory is not readable you can pull any of the content if you know it by name ill describe command line cli solution to get the names and the files however the backup tools suggested by izzy are the easiest way to go this is step by step method to get the list of packages and pull the packages using the commandline download and install the android sdk package or see is there minimal installation of adb for solution requiring much less space if youre not intending to develop android apps while youll have access to just about everything in the world android dont be too overwhimed just focus on an immediate objective and all the other features can be for different day add path to these two directories of the package install installedpath tools and installedpath platform tools for full sdk installation now with the android plugged in via the usb run this to get the full list of installed apps adb shell pm list packages you now have list the names of all your install apps use the parameter to get the full pathname of desired package by specifying search string found in the previous list adb shell pm list packages reader now pull the full pathname of the package you want to get with adb pull filepathname destination path adb pull data app com ebooks ebookreader apk mybackupdir the steps might appear to be complicated but they are easier done than said once you perform it few times youll find it very easy to pull any app from your device you can also write script to do this as your own personal backup utility while there are gui alternatives as mentioned in the alternate answer strongly recommend looking at the features of the adb commands which includes full backups the option for users to select precisely what they want backed up and where installing the full android sdk will give fuller access to components of your android device from the commandline look at the commands adb help look at the backup section of the help screen adb backup file apk noapk obb noobb shared noshared all system nosystem packages write an archive of the devices data to file if no option is supplied then the data is written to backup ab in the current directory apk noapk enable disable backup of the apks themselves in the archive the default is noapk obb noobb enable disable backup of any installed apk expansion aka obb files associated with each application the default is noobb shared noshared enable disable backup of the devices shared storage sd card contents the default is noshared all means to back up all installed applications system nosystem toggles whether all automatically includes system applications the default is to include system apps packages is the list of applications to be backed up if the all or shared flags are passed then the package list is optional applications explicitly given on the command line will be included even if nosystem would ordinarily cause them to be omitted you can use the android backup extractor to explore the compressed backup file created by the adb utility restoring the backup to the android is simple restore command adb restore file the android backup extractor provides way to explore the backup and pick out individual files such as the apks as in the ops objective to store or preserve the explorer package includes variety of multi platform tools such as java perl and cygwin you can extract the backup with using the java extract opton this line converts the android backup into tar file java jar abe jar unpack backup ab backup tar out side of my initial cli answer the most precise gui app to accomplish the ops specific question is airdroid its free extremely user friendly and intuitive to use to use run the app it gives local ip address for typing into web browser the link will give you ui that resembles and android home screen click on the apps icon and select one or more apps to download you can install or reinstall the apps using the same interface there are several other gui alternatives graphical user interfaces available qtadb multi platform or for windows users also the excellent droid explorer by our member ryan conrad see full backup of non rooted devices for more also see our adb tag wiki
75514 you cannot pull data folder directly since adb doesnt have file listing access to it if you want to pull the data folder you can do it via recovery custom recovery cwm twrp run adb while device is in recovery mode hopefully custom recovery or as root copy data to another directory sdcard and pull it from there
75555 files and directories below data data are protected from the average user so you cannot simply pull them unless the adb daemon is running in root mode other than the file you were referring to system buildprop is at least readable by all apps folders below data data are invisible except for root so they cannot even be read to be able to use adb pull on them you need to make your adb daemon run in root mode first depending on the device simple adb root command might do that but most devices will refuse to do in those cases you can use chainfires adbd insecure install this app on your device start it there and manually switch to insecure mode now the pull should succeed remark its called insecure because running adbd as root gives everybody with computer and an usb cable access to everything on your device just in case you wonder
75932 have galaxy s4 and use connectbot to connect to my ssh server and setup port forward via the client to port then setup firefox to use the socks proxy by just going to about config and entering the following network proxy socks network proxy socks port or whatever port you chose to forward in connectbot network proxy socks remote dns true network proxy type this tells firefox to use your manual proxy settings hope this helps
76983 carl parker writes about it on android authority partly reproduced here in case the original post goes down for apps installed on the device assuming you have installed the app on your device go to the app google play store link and take note of the words after id and ignore the rest connect your device to the computer via usb cable open the command prompt on your computer and type the following commands adb remount adb shell su cd data app type the command ls appfilename where appfilename is the app id on google play store make sure you include the asterisk at the end this command will display the app complete apk filename enter the following command mv apk full filename here system app apk full filename here exit exit adb reboot the device will now reboot your app is now saved as system app for apps whose apks are on the pc hard drive open command prompt on your computer and navigate to where the apk file is located enable usb debugging on your device and connect your device to the computer via usb cable enter the following commands adb remount adb push apk filename here system app adb shell chmod system app apk filename here adb reboot your phone will automatically reboot your app will now be saved as system app

77311 you dont need an external tool for this on the versions of the play store with the new simplified permissions dialog you can still find full list of permissions from the apps store page the screen with the icon at the top description screenshots scroll down to the bottom of the page under additional information youll see permissions with link view details click this link to see dialog with the list of individual permissions however if you do want an external tool appbrain is an alternative web front end to the play store and lists the permissions individually for each app from there you can click through to install the app from the real play store not all apps appear on appbrain but many of them do especially the popular apps theres also resource offered by izzy good friend of this site his website offers curated list of apps searchable by permissions it also gives fuller description of each permission and highlights interesting combinations because apps are added to his site by manual process its very small list compared to the huge number of apps on the play store but consists of good range of recommended and popular apps in different categories
77321 in his answer dan already pointed to my list of apps by real life topics which offers some extras as well currently it only covers small subset of whats available on google play though for some numbers apps of google play including roughly of the apps available in aptoides curated main repository and third of the apps available on droid with some overlappings one more resource to mention for apps not covered there is appbrain which is different front end to google play store so you should find all apps there and they also show concerns what dan put as interesting combinations very useful thing to be warned about potential danger if an app is missing from their list you can easily make it appear by copy pasting its package name or full google play url on this page it might take some minutes then but it will eventually be available usually within minutes update galen recently also introduced his app stripsearch ive used it little and had an intensive discussion with him partly playing beta tester this app not only shows you the permissions before installing an app it even allows you to filter your app searches by permissions to exclude unwanted ones privacy concerns or specifically require others such as using the real flash light when in need of flashlight app practically excluding those using the display or other means runs pretty well definitely worth try you can find stripsearch at google play
77424 one way you can achieve this is using an app rsync and use tasker job to periodically or conditionally upload download data from your phone you can refer to rsyncs documentation for its configuration and other setup steps you can configure it to only specify required one way transfer of files
77426 foldersync could come in handy here define folder pair which directory on your android device to sync with which directory on your computer using any of the available protocols sftp samba or any other then either chose for some auto check have it synced every night or push the button manually using the paid version you could even bring in tasker which is what do every night at 3am when connected to any power source and to my wifi network sync all my backups photos whatsnots
78530 yes it is absolutely safe to charge device with charger that has more current capacity than needed ohms law tells us the relation between current voltage and resistance current voltage resistance since the voltage is held constant 5v the only factor that determines current draw is the load another term for resistance the device places on the charger thus the device will only draw as much current as it needs and no more
79196 the following answer is supplemental recommend using the phone settings menu to disable sns if it is already running the phone will handle that automatically by force closing it go to settings more application manager all if you ever want to enable sns again you can do so by going to settings more application manager turned off you will find it listed here tap on it and then tap the turn on button to enable following screenshots are taken from samsung galaxy s4 plus gt i9506 hope these can serve as reference for future visitors one of the apps that are clearly affected by disabling sns is the gallery app the sns app has the following special permissions com sec android app gallery3d read sns com sec android app gallery3d write sns if am right which may not be but which certainly should be and am mostly right anyway this menas that you wont be able to share things like photos and videos directly through the gallery or the camer gallery app camera switches to gallery when previewing photos you will have to start the facebook app and then pick your photos and videos for upload as can be seen from the screenshots above the icon of sns does not look like facebook icon its plain simple android robot icon with package on his belly it may indicate hes pregnant hihi baby droid is on the way
80968 not full answer came here looking for an answer myself but here are couple of partial solutions figured out so far perhaps someone else can improve upon these first of all temporary files for the last few photosphere sessions can be found under sdcard android data com google android gallery3d files panorama sessions you can extract these out and use an external program such as hugin to stich them tried this on couple of photospheres and though they didnt come out great have at least something instead of nothing kept the files around and looking around for good guide on using hugin was able to trick photo app to reprocess them but it didnt produce desirable result this is what did connected the phone to my laptop and went into the directory where the session files are via adb shell identified the directory for my previous session while the camera is still connected to the laptop started taking new photosphere took couple of snaps identified the directory for the new session copied all files from old session directory to the new session directory ended the photosphere to trigger processing the photo app did process the old images but it doesnt reread the session meta and orientations txt and instead uses the data from the new session must be cached in memory the result is that you dont get full photosphere unless you complete the photosphere in the new session also which dont mind doing in the interest of saving the photosphere except that realized had to capture the new photosphere in exactly the same sequence as before or the resultant image will all be out of place as it would be stiched in the wrong order ideally if there is hidden task in the photo app to invoke the rendering we should be able to trigger it on the old sessions folder but dont know where to begin
81017 the actual hardware no it is system on chip soc and cannot be upgraded however you can use swap for this purpose however the performace will take large hit even on class sd card swap is in short virtual ram with swap small portion of the hard drive is set aside and used like ram the computer will attempt to keep as much information as possible in ram until the ram is full at that point the computer will begin moving inactive blocks of memory called pages to the hard disk freeing up ram for active processes if one of the pages on the hard disk needs to be accessed again it will be moved back into ram and different inactive page in ram will be moved onto the hard disk swapped the trade off is disks and sd cards are considerably slower than physical ram so when something needs to be swapped there is noticeable performance hit unlike traditional swap androids memory manager kills inactive processes to free up memory android signals to the process then the process will usually write out small bit of specific information about its state for example google maps may write out the map view coordinates browser might write the url of the page being viewed and then the process exits when you next access that application it is restarted the application is loaded from storage and retrieves the state information that it saved when it last closed in some applications this makes it seem as if the application never closed at all this is not much different from traditional swap except that android apps are specially programmed to write out very specific information making androids memory manager more efficient that swap there are also other pitfalls with this method you need to turn off swap before you mount sd via usb if you dont you will not be able to mount sd as swapfile is active and set to read only which will deny request to mount usb storage tl dr yes in theory in practice its not good as an alternative kitkat has smaller memory footprint and is supposed to be optimised for ram devices look around xda for rom for your device maybe and see if that would help
81075 great and detailed answer from nikolay elenkov however should added that somebody already develop software that do just that and package it here http sourceforge net projects adbextractor the package contains both java and perl tool myself prefer perl over java any day so extracted the perl codes make sure they are executable installed the required perl library and run the backupdecrypt pl against an adb backup file and it convert it into tar or gzipped tar file without any issue even formed one liner in bash that allow me to do adb backup directly to gzipped tar file adb backup backupdecrypt pl backup tgz all hope it helps

81339 firstly and most important the credits made this following this great tutorial at xda developers by user metalgearhathaway http forum xda developers com galaxy s2 development derivatives mod partition internal memory app t2538947 used pit files ill explain what they are dont worry made from user elgamal from xda also located here comment number and little bit of help from user crackdaddy also from xda second what youll need machine running windows used windows ultimate bits odin careful when installing it is full of optional adwares theres also linux and mac version available called jodin3 but didnt try it flashable clockworkmod for galaxy ii it is tar file with file named zimage inside pit file with desired partition table configuration samsung drivers for galaxy s2 usually you can install samsung kies but theres also installer just with drivers available your original stock unrooted samsung jellybean firmware you can find it at sammobile com any rom of your choice highly recommend the last nightly build of cyanogenmod optionally gapps or newer made most of those available in the following bundle file https drive google com openid 0bxccpydiocbpd21foe5magjimku authuser what is missing is gapps cyanogenmod and stock samsung jellybean rom as it depends of country and carrier and might not be legal to provide it here third the default warning am not responsible for anything that might go wrong with your device neither any of the mentioned users nor anyone here at stack overflow or xda developers this procedure will root your phone if it isnt already and also void your warranty if it isnt already if anything goes wrong dont panic it is most likely fixable by reflashing the stock rom and starting over again finally how to this will only work with the 16gb international version gt i9100 of samsung galaxy ii firstly copy cyanogenmod zip file or your desired rom and optionally gapps zip file to your external sd card make backup of everything inside your internal storage copy it to your computer or somewhere else it will be completelly erased dont worry about your external sd card it wont be touched make nand backup of your current rom youll be able to restore it after the repartition to do it you must have clockworkmod recovery installed then boot your phone into recovery mode volume up home power select backups and restore then backup to storage sdcard1 when backup finishes reboot your phone into download mode volume down home power and connect your phone to the computer let windows install the drivers if it fails try to install samsung kies or just the drivers provided in the bundle made available and try again open odin3 as administrator and connect the phone it should detect your phone and show it under the label id com and also in the message if it didnt try to restart your computer phone reinstall drivers check your usb cable etc and try again now youll need to choose pit file pit means partition information table and it is samsung only thing in the bundle file made available elgamals pit file i91001gb 6gb pit which also resizes system partition to 1gb data to 6gb and the rest goes to internal storage if you wish different sizes check the thread at xda developers as he made many different versions available also included pit file for the default configuration i9100 2gb stock pit if you wish to go back to as it was later when you have chosen your pit file go to odin and tick the following checkboxes re partition auto reboot and reset time in the re partition section click on the pit button and select your chosen pit file in the files download section click on the ap button and select samsungs stock jellybean rom double check everything and click start this can take while go grab coffee after everything finishes your phone will reboot into the stock samsung jellybean rom two things can happen now or it will work normally and if so you can use it and check if everything is as you want or it can ask you for password to access the encrypted volume which is nothing but your internal storage that is not formatted in both ways unplug your phone it its still plugged and reboot it into download mode again it is interesting to close and reopen odin3 to reset the settings plug your phone again and wait until odin3 detects it this time leave checked just auto reboot and reset time and make sure re partition is not checked click on ap button and select the clockworkmod recovery tar file then click start this one is faster but if you feel sleepy go for another coffee when it finishes you should have clockworkmod recovery installed in your phone so go ahead and reboot into recovery mode go to mounts and storage select format storage sdcard0 and format it as exfat if for some reason you have write problems in your internal storage later come back here and select another format until it works but exfat should do the trick when it finishes still in recovery mode wipe data factory reset wipe cache and wipe dalvik cache lets be sure nothing remains from the previous roms now install zip choose zip from storage sdcard1 and select the cyanogenmod zip file or of your desired rom and flash it optionally also flash gapps afterwards reboot your phone and check if everything is right if everything is right reboot your phone into recovery mode again do new wipe data factory reset wipe cache and wipe dalvik cache and then recover your backed up rom from the beginning reboot your phone check again if everything works right few apps might need to be reinstalled spotify and waze are examples to work correctly again but thats be only major issue hope everything goes well
81774 im not sure for all apps involved but for most the general rule of thumbs applies go to settings apps select the all tab to also show pre installed apps walk the apps one by one open their entries and select clear cache plus delete data especially exclude things like google play services but include the calendar provider and contacts provider or similar named entries its good idea to first make backup just in case and also to keep log of what you cleared the former in case you hit one app too much the latter in case you need to perform factory reset one day as after that sync would be automatically enabled by default and you can only disable it after having finished the wizard and re created your account so all calendars contacts etc would be back
81775 as always do backup of your device before removing anything if you dont understand something that is stated please ask before continuing go into settings and turn off all syncs goto settings apps locate the google apps you dont want running clear data and disable each one at time leave playstore play services services framework and accounts manager intact im not sure about partner setup and one time init try those and if not working properly re enable or assuming you are rooted you can manually uninstall most of the google apps if you know which ones to remove leave playstore play services services framework and accounts manager intact im not sure about partner setup and one time init use system app mover https play google com store apps detailsid de j4velin systemappmover hl en to switch apps from system to user space then delete from there or assuming you are rooted the easiest way of slimming down on the google apps would be to flash minimal gapps to your device that have the core requirements necessary for your apps from playstore to function properly you can add on any of the other features after that as needed like stated at the top make sure you make backup nandroid so any issues can be easily corrected good luck
82271 android studio does not contain adb you need android sdk for it it is installed on first run of android studio and newer adb is located in sdk platform tools its possible to add to path in windows and use terminal inside android studio only by command adb shell and after use su get root shell locate the sdk platform tools folder android sdk platform tools open enviroment variables in windows see http www computerhope com issues ch000549 htm append the platform tools path android sdk platform tools to the path variable reopen android studio use terminal with adb shell older windows will maybe need to reboot after changing the path variables on newer android studio versions the android sdk is copied on folder outside the android studio folder it is downloaded after the first time you run android studio for more information see android studio in beta channel
82314 even if that is true that would not apply to all screens such as an amoled screen that doesnt use backlight from wikipedia article on amoled the amount of power the display consumes varies significantly depending on the colour and brightness shown as an example one commercial qvga oled display consumes watts while showing white text on black background but more than watts showing black text on white background while an lcd may consume only constant watts regardless of what is being shown on screen also read the claims on the apps themselves most dont even claim to effect battery life on other screens from screen filter app applies shade that acts as dimmer to ensure your eyes dont hurt far more powerful than androids built in brightness setting great for low light gaming web browsing and ebook reading it even saves battery life for amoled displays from night mode app if you have an amoled display you can also save battery
82322 think youve got to differentiate between software layers and hardware layers in the first place if you put display foil on top of the screen that will certainly not reduce battery consumption though it dims your display but if its software layer reducing brightness thats something completely different how should that be achieved other than reducing the amount of light created its not physical layer on top though it kind of works like that when it comes to lcds have no means of proving it physically but here are two ways can imagine2 reducing light intensity of the light generators leds for oled or backlight for lcd by feeding less power to them which would work for both types of displays and is the way the actual brightness control works altering the color values convering ffffff to dddddd making white light gray primarily working for oled to safe power but in theory also for displays using differently colored leds or led arrays to compose the color if such exist3 as dan put it1 using filter overlay like this will make either type of screen look darker but itll only reduce power use on oled screens on lcd screens only decreasing the backlight brightness saves power apart from that your quotes nowhere state the filters would not affect power consumption in either way following up discussion in chat between dan and me on lcds it in fact is similar quoting dan using software overlay to darken pixels on an lcd screen wont reduce the power consumption which works by putting transparent grey full screen window on top of other windows thats more likely to increase overall power consumption because youre giving the window compositor more work to do doesnt contradict whith what wrote but gives more insight in applying the right filter to the wrong display type the same amount of backlight is generated just the crystals lcd liquid crystal display are darker there might be other possibilities which escaped me so dont claim the list to be complete it should give some insight nevertheless there are differently colored leds at least for red green and blue read rgb so such combination would cover the full color spectrum making displays like this potentially possible note didnt say they already exist different colors feature different efficiency so red ifying the screen would safe power red orange leds feature the most lumen per watt according to wikipedia

83586 encrypt your filesystem youll need to enter password or pin on every boot to decrypt it so as soon as the device is rebooted none of your personal data will be readable twrp even supports encrypted filesystems it prompts you for your password when it starts as well think if your device is at least then you can even leave adb on theyd need to unlock the screen to add their computer to the whitelist so they cant push apps or read data there either youll be able to have root custom bootloader adb enabled and still have relatively secure device
83687 recently found that same setting number of processes allowed to run in background and reduced that setting on my gt s7562l from standard limit to only immediately saw significant improvement in performance and so far there have been no problems made the change out of desperation my phone had nearly morphed into brick it was continually running slow and would often just simply lock up have read that shortfall of android systems is that they allow applications to keep grabbing memory until its gone maybe have solved that problem for my phone guess ill know in few days but so far im quite happy

86630 recently came across this issue on nexus and tried most the solutions listed here with no luck in my case it looks to be caused by recognized bug with stock android source my solution was as follows used windows but no reason this wouldnt work on osx linux root is required on device however on your pc create tar gz archive of all the files you wish to transfer used 7zip for this its worth mentioning on windows youll need to create the tar archive first then apply the gz compression transfer the archive to the device using ftp ensuring the mfmt command is used ftp server supports mfmt on the device side just install and enable no extra configuration needed on the pc used filezilla you do need to ensure transfer preserve timestamps of transferred files is checked on the device extract the archive in shell as root using terminal emulator first ensure you have root access by using the su command you may need to grant access if supersu pops up navigate to the directory now containing the tar gz archive with the cd command cd sdcard extract the archive using the following tar xvf archive name here tar gz note for some reason when extracted directly to the dcim camera directory the pictures would not show up at all in the stock gallery app if this happens to you suggest you extract to different directory and then move not copy the files to your camera directory suspect this is caused by permissions issue you can use the terminal or your file manager of choice to move the files reboot for good measure this allowed all the files date modified attributes to remain intact and left all photos in the correct order when viewed in the gallery app
86746 it is folder that is being created by applock after its latest release on oct had this folder on my sd card deleted that folder and it came back again then when deleted applock the folder didnt come back installed applock from backup and the folder was still not created but after updating the app the folder got created again so guess they changed the way their apps worked so dont delete it its important for the app to work properly
86938 think your best bet is to unroot your device and restore it to stock this means stock rom recovery and kernel and you will be unrooted this is often referred to as flashing factory image sometimes incorrectly but thats what were going to do note this process will wipe your phone completely backup your storage before you continue am also not responsible if anything goes wrong ensure you verify this is the correct device and code name hammerhead before you proceed from this excellent xda thread for this process you will need to install adb and fastboot drivers to do this use this simple program for mac users note mac users will have to write before every command in this thread for example fastboot flash recovery recovery img linux users should know their stuff download the latest factory images from here extract the archive you downloaded use winrar it should look like this unlock your bootloader in case you havent already link here flashing the factory images power off your phone boot it in fastboot by pressing and holding power button volume down at the same time connect your phone to your pc through your usb cable execute the flash all bat script for windows or flash all shfor mac and linux in the folder where you extracted the factory images for mac youll have to edit the flash all sh and add before every fastboot command wait for everything to flash after everything finished select recovery using the volume buttons when small dead android appears press power button volume up select wipe data factory data reset reboot your phone should be stock note the xda thread has further detail on re locking the device and resetting the tamper flag should you need to claim warranty its bit outside the scope of this answer but it might be of use note some nexus devices will show as having gb after this on the gb model the below is fix via cmd fastboot erase boot fastboot erase cache fastboot erase recovery fastboot erase system fastboot erase userdata fastboot flash bootloader image hammerhead krt16m bootloader img fastboot reboot bootloader fastboot flash radio image hammerhead krt16m radio img fastboot reboot bootloader fastboot flash system image hammerhead krt16m system img fastboot flash userdata image hammerhead krt16m userdata img note this command will wipe your device including sdcard even if your bootloader is already unlocked fastboot flash boot image hammerhead krt16m boot img fastboot flash recovery image hammerhead krt16m recovery img

87726 after doing some more research think ive found partial solution here http forum xda developers com showthread phpt first you need to get adb set up on your computer in linux its pretty easy something like running apt get install android tools adb or downloading and extracting directory find your partitions run something like adb shell cat proc partitions there are other options in the link for how to find and identify all the partitions copy the data the dd tool should be available you can run something like dd if dev block mmcblk0p9 of sdcard image img unfortunately have two problems with this the first is that the permissions on partition devices might require root access the second is that the kindle fire hdx and many other modern devices that dont have usb mass storage also dont use sd cards so there is no easy location to write the image you want that isnt already used for something else on the device im trying to find way to mount network devices or transfer data over usb between the device and computer adb push and adb pull wont do whats needed as far as can tell ill update this if can find good solution otherwise ill ask some other questions about it edit this page has great description along the lines of what have above http www df lth se jokke androidfilerecovery as noted below root is necessary but there are usually lots of ways to get that easily unfortunately was working with the fire hdx halfway through my copying data to an image file the thing auto downloads an update to next thing know root access disappears and dont think theres an exploit out for it yet probably lost any recoverable data after the update was written to the internal storage anyway im so frustrated with amazon lately

87900 as far as know currently there is no setting to turn off the safety lock due to the addition of notifications on the lock screen strangely the lock is still there even if the user chooses not to display any notification the best bet to bypass this is to use smart locks trusted face new feature in android lollipop similar to previous face unlock you can bypass both safety lock and pattern lock simultaneously by looking at the phone while on the lock screen would say there is no downside as far as my experience goes if it fails to detect your face then you just have to swipe up and draw the pattern normally how to set up go to settings security tap smart lock confirm your current pattern lock tap trusted face and follow the instruction

88222 lollipop does not appear to allow bluetooth low energy devices to be used for smart lock believe that fitbits are devices of this type have similar issue with one of fitbits rivals ive successfully set up smart lock with normal bluetooth devices such as speaker in my kitchen ones that show connection in the bluetooth settings but im unable to do it with my up24 band
88278 from an article on android police if youre on lollipop device and arent seeing this yet you can manually install the build of play services from apkmirror emphasis mine the build is for nexus on lollipop the new trusted places feature is available starting from google play services you might want to check the version of your google play services go to settings apps go to all tabs find and select google play service check the version under the app name above as of google has updated their play services for nexus on lollipop you can either wait until google push the update automatically or sideload install it manually from apkmirror version
88289 adding to what andrew posted one can also have trusted location phone will not challenge user with the pattern lock if the user is present at the location added in this setting home and work locations will be present by default more locations could be added trusted devices one can add bluetooth devices such as android wear or bluetooth headsets etc phone will recognize those devices and will bypass pattern unlocker
88440 tried what youre saying few times and after you close the camera youre back on the lock screen unless you were actually looking at the phone it recognized your face and it unlocked itself milliseconds before opening the camera you can notice that the symbol in the middle goes from that of person to that of an unlocked lock when it recognizes you
88441 just as kushtrim mentioned also suspect that its due to trusted face maybe its too sensitive or the face you provided is still too general that everyones face is detected as yours some suggestions that could think of turn off trusted face its an obvious solution but you cannot enjoy this new feature improve the trusted face recognition it might be hit or miss but its worth try go to settings security choose smart lock confirm the saved pattern choose trusted face improve face matching follow the instruction and do it number of times to further improve it
88443 you can simply erase you security credentials in security and this will automatically allow you to remove the lock screen on
88642 heres how to do it press volume button to get menu with three items none priority and all select priority in the dropdown that appears tap the cog for interruptions settings you can also access this through settings under priority interruptions turn on calls and turn off the other two options that should work but havent tested it edit apologies missed the part about your still wanting vibrations and led notifications from things other than calls suspect there isnt way to do that built in it may be possible using something like the light flow app
88841 am replying see no one else has because have always used the calendar notifications functionality in the exact same way you have and was also distressed of this change in functionality think we are in the minority though because your post is the first acknowledgement have even seen anywhere about this issue the only solution have is to look at third party apps although someone appears to have ported an older ics jelly bean era version of the stock calendar which you can find in the play store have not used that too much at the moment am using business calendar which think comes somewhat close to replicating the functionality you and are accustomed to although am still watching it to see also gave today calendar very close look it is much closer to the google aesthetic and even has aspects of material design implemented it appeared also to have persistent notification functionality although for some reason had problems with the syncing this may have been fixed if you have come up with any solutions would love to hear them good luck

89738 in this respect there is no difference between regular pc and android the terminologies however is slightly confusing system memory refers to the storage space that is used by system files and device memory refers to all storage space device memory does not refer to ram your devices ram can be seen in settings more application manager is there single memory chip acting as both storage medium for files when the device is turned off as well as random access memory for the running operating system executables and apps in execution sort of most android device uses system on chip soc what is included in soc varies depending on the particular chip and device but typical soc may have cpu ram gpu wireless and possibly storage manufactured in single chip in regular pc these are usually separate components soc is used in mobile devices to save space wasted due to separate component packaging but internally there is still delineation between the components where can see the amount of space available on my sim card afaik you cant android have very limited support for sim card facility it uses the sim card only for telephony functions and importing existing contacts there into the devices address book
89774 now realize that as to the first part of the question as pointed out the storage screen is displaying information on internal storage excluding sim card storage space external sd card storage space and ram memory which is just temporary storage location which is on separate chip and does not serve as persistent storage location the reason was getting confused is that the terms storage and memory are mixed interchangeably on this screen even more confusing on the samsung galaxy siii site the amount of this internal storage is listed under the heading memory with subheading total internal memory gb gb internal memory whereas in the world of desktop computers the term memory usually refers to ram this is what was confusing me later realized that to view the amount of ram including the percentage of unavailable ram on the system there is another window which can be accessed by long pressing the home hardware key and then clicking on the pie chart icon in the lower left hand corner as in the following screenshots ive added picture of what soc system on chip looks like as posted many systems now come as socs with cpu internal memory ram and other component all integrated into one chip but at the same time still separate from one another as an alternative place where to find information on ram used as opposed to long pressing the home key and clicking on the pie chart icon one can also go to settings more application manager and swipe twice to the right to see the running tab which displays the same information at the bottom as in the following screenshot click to enlarge the above screen displays all running processes by contrast long pressing the home hardware key only displays those running processes which have gui in the foreground excluding background tasks thanks
89795 mobile phones use ir based proximity sensors to detect the presence of human ear this sensing is done for two purposes reduce display power consumption by turning off the lcd backlight and to disable the touch screen to avoid inadvertent touches by the cheek ir sensors have number of disadvantages including high power consumption high cost blind zones and accumulation of dirt as well as unreliable performance over temperature hair and skin color variations
90160 its likely due to the fact that gps is simply not very well suited for getting precise altitude measurements and never has been certainly not typical consumer grade chips garmin suggests that variances of up to feet are to be expected in their devices for example its just geometry problem with that in mind would doubt that android has much of meaningful impact here any gps device will struggle to get particularly accurate altitude reading suppose some apps may appear to be more precise than others by taking windowed averages of the altitude data or something rather than directly surfacing the raw data to the user but theyll all be getting the same values from the gps chip
90264 you could try this app gps aids it tries to provide quicker and more stable fix by providing couple of gps aids gps aiding data like lto long term orbits gpsonextra and agps and it caches your last known gps data it will run without root but some options require root access
90375 wifi to cellular handover is feature in phones that automatically switches to cellular data when you do not have strong wifi connection you would want to enable this for few reasons it will save battery if your phone doesnt switch to cellular data when it cant connect to wifi connection your phone will continue to search for wifi thus using battery you wont have to turn off wifi when you leave your house or when you dont have connection in order to use data
91431 kudos to bruno for detailed solution and needed files much quicker method is listed below which does not require installing any rom gapps or reboot into the rom in between steps you need an external sd card with enough free space to hold all apps data photos etc that are on your internal phone storage you can skip steps if you already have cwm and also nand backup on your external sd card already but make sure you have nand backup on your external sd or else youll lose all data note you should backup your data from your internal sd card too in case things go awry storage sdcard0 nand backup does not back that up extract the files provided by bruno somewhere on your pc reboot phone in download mode vol down home power then connect it to the pc via usb start odin uncheck auto reboot put the cwm kitkatcompatible i9100 tar file in the ap section then click start and wait until odin says res ok in the message log this should be fairly quick few seconds now reboot the phone in recovery mode vol up home power go to backup and restore backup to storage sdcard1 note the not your cwm may say external sd instead of storage sdcard1 just chose the backup option corresponding to the external sd card this is important otherwise youll lose all data wait for the backup to finish this will take while reboot phone into download mode vol down home power start odin uncheck auto reboot check re partition put the file i91001gb 6gb pit in the pit section put the file cwm kitkatcompatible i9100 tar in the ap section then click start and wait until odin says res ok in the message log this will take while reboot phone into recovery mode vol up home power go to mounts and storage format system then format cache then format data go back to wipe data factory reset go back to backup and restore restore from storage sdcard1 and restore the nand backup made previously done reboot phone normally procedure tested with cyanogenmod kitkat nightly and snapshot should work with any recent rom no need to install any custom or stock roms or gapps or even boot into the rom in between steps disclaimer cant be held responsible if your phone starts singing or dancing lambada oh how hate that song calls you names blows up loses any of your data etc
91462 the code for shouldswitchnetwork best explains what it does it just artificially reduces the wifi rssi received signal strength indication to encourage the wifi state machine to decide to switch the connection from wifi to cellular network around line of wifistatemachine java line for android r10 int rssi mwifiinfo getrssi maggressivehandover homenetworkboost wificonfiguration home network rssi boost the variable maggressivehandover is an int that is set to or by the developer settings private void writewifiaggressivehandoveroptions mwifimanager enableaggressivehandovermwifiaggressivehandover ischecked the rssi variable goes on to influence how the connection is classified isbadrssi islowrssi or ishighrssi as to why its hidden under the developer options id say that is because it seems little hackish with seemingly arbitrary scalar that some dev came up with to nudge the behavior in the desired direction google is probably uncertain about the consequences of this setting and the optimal way to adjust rssi if im wrong and this is somehow meaningful im happy to admit it and explain here why turning this setting off does not turn off cellular handover altogether the wifi connection still gets score and is disabled if the score is too low but hey the initial score is set arbitrarily too
91657 it seems to be an app which opens that dialog over webpage try to boot into safe mode press and hold the power button until the power menu appears hold down reboot on phones which do not have the option to reboot press and hold power off then your phone will reboot into safe mode that means all your apps are deactivated for this session if you wont get any of these weird dialogs there then restart your phone to get all your apps back and deactivate uninstall your apps step by step you can also try adaway which has an inbuilt adware scanner https droid org repo org adaway apk
91661 not exactly matching your description using the last known position if not gps available but still good alternative on two of my devices completely got rid of all proprietary google services replacing them by alternatives in detail ive described this in android without google free your droid update in short this is what ive done flash custom rom that comes without gapps here cyanogenmod installing microg successor of nogapps generating the lacells db as described at xda and pushed it to the device as result ive got totally offline working location service using cell tower ids and the lacells db playstore access via blankstore or yalpstore and working maps api using openstreetmap so with no gps active still get my location as long as there are cell towers in reach can however not say whether its using the last known position if theres no gps and no cell towers disclosure link go to one of my sites
91662 no its not virus the notification is triggered by advertisements on the webpage just dont click ok and ignore it
91667 what you are seeing looks like javascript alert as long as you dont believe the lies some websites will be feeding you the only danger javascript alert introduces is the possibility that site may keep opening so many javascript alerts that you wont be able to leave the site before another alert pops up but decent browser can stop that for you in this particular case guess it is case of an advertiser lying to you in order to convince you to buy product which you dont need

91889 as far as know no you cant tl dr closing all background apps is bad practice you should close apps that you dont use often or apps you specifically want to close for reason imo the only good reason to close all recent apps is that you feel like there are too many of them and you cant find an app any more because of the mess it creates the recent apps feature in lollipop appears to behave differently from previous versions first of all as you noticed the button to clear all recent apps is gone moreover the recent apps persist through reboot read on android police the recent apps list now persists through reboot now you still can clear them by swiping all the cards which agree is tedious but as the top comment on the ap post quoted above explains clearing out all of the apps in recents just puts more work on cpu and thus your battery because youre essentially having to start from scratch the next time you load it if something stays in your recents list and is in ram it loads instantly with virtually no battery or processing penalty minus refreshing the content via the network connection basically all the android users including me while ago who frequently clear their recent apps use task killers etc are using their android device the wrong way you can read more about why you shouldnt use task killer on android post by cybervibin on xda which is roughly the same as killing the apps yourself in short unused ram is useless ram if large amount of ram is required by an app the system will stop recent apps by itself to provide the newly launched app the needed resources no need to stop them yourself its the oss job also recommend the read of this question on android enthusiasts about what happens when you swipe an app out of the recent apps list to conclude to this day and as far as know you cant clear your recent apps all at once on android lollipop but you shouldnt have to do that anyway which is surely why googles teams removed the button
92165 go to app drawer downloads find the downloading item delete that
92208 another option without wiping any data is to when an ota update is available get the direct link and download the zip file to your pc download the latest image version of your custom recovery eg twrp and the latest supersu zip to your pc connect your device to your pc and reboot into bootloader mode then dirty flash the stock boot recovery system partitions of your current android version in stock recovery mode install the ota zip via adb sideload update zip reboot into bootloader mode flash back your custom recovery image alternatively flash your custom kernel reboot into recovery mode in the custom recovery mode root the device via adb sideload update supersu vx zip now clear cache and dalvik cache and reboot the system done ota applied and you can just pick up from where you left this is not the only method of course and is not recommended for major version updates but for minor version updates this is imho preferable to dirty flashing the new system and to any method that require data wipe very detailed step by step version of this solution can be found here https gist github com eyecatchup ec0a852428c19705380e
92506 no you cant as you surmise if you root your phone and write programs that use root to change system files or settings that you cant normally change then you can break the phone that way the risk is not really any different to running root programs that other people have written if you dont root the phone or dont use root in the apps youre writing then you can only do what any other app might do you might run the battery down extra quickly or if your app has the appropriate permissions delete pictures contacts but debugging your own app wont cause any kind of system corruption or random problems
92524 you can use your android for development in fact you should use your android device for development the emulators are ok for very little things but its far from being enough you cant break your phone if youre doing beginner development and youre not touching system files on the device in the wooooorst case you would need to format it you said youd work with java ndk and that doesnt exist is java or ndk java its well java high level language used by android and ndk is the native development kit and thats and languages mainly used for game development beginner programmer should start with java inside android because of its goodies and development tools what are you going to do with the device the listviews arrays images buttons or anything else youd use in the development cant break it
93055 it seems that this cyanogenmod only option as andrew states he does not have this option in stock android lollipop but have little button to clear them all click image to enlarge it also works with lollipop on htc one m7 with sense by double tapping home button tap the dots on upper right corner go to settings and change from card view to grid view when you double tap the home button again you will now see an button to close all recent apps that are open
93615 to the best of my knowledge just having your phone rooted does not make it memory efficient and that means it will not automatically become suitable for high end mobile games rooting phone gives you additional privileges one of most common of which is privilege to remove system apps that are shipped by your device manufacturer you can try this yourself by downloading some bulky apps from play store and soon when you will reach device memory threshold you will find that android os will complain and ask you to free some memory albeit your phone is rooted good luck
93616 is it possible yes if you do enough tweaking to the graphics drivers so it doesnt crash or at least renders something some graphical effects may not work properly or it may be extremely slow or you may have to add swap space or edit the apk to skip particularly intensive parts you can always make any games work with enough effort is it good idea no in general its not worth the effort the experience would be so crappy the developer wouldnt want to support it and youll just make it frustrating for yourself there are many great games that runs well on low end phones why would you want to play choppy inferior version of game on device that just cannot play it if you still want to play it without having to spend on high end device imo its better to just wait few years until the new low end devices become powerful enough for that game credit xkcd

93868 while you add the google account or even afterwards from account settings you can select the content and services to sync you can select only gmail leaving alone all the other services you dont want like google drive sheets docs etc theres no need to setup third party email client all most google apps are aware of this functionality and will work correctly
93972 found workaround for my problem that works splendidly after having installed the latest version of the gmail app have discovered that when go to settings account add account can configure generic email address not necessarily gmail one to be used with the said app it supports both imap and pop3 protocols sorry for the italian but it should be understandable nonetheless suppose that this feature was meant to use email addresses from other providers inside the gmail app but it will accept any email configuration even gmail one so selected imap for my second and third email addresses and now can access those accounts just for gmail this way they wont be able to get in they way on other apps on google help center have found the settings required to configure an imap account on an external client which have used im reporting them here for completeness to configure the email app on an android device for access to gmail just follow the steps below enable imap in your gmail settings open the email application tap menu and the settings in the top corner tap select next to get started with setup enter your full gmail address and password then select next on the next screen you can give the account nickname and choose the name to display on your outgoing messages tap done and youre done you can verify your settings from the inbox view by tapping menu select account and then scroll to server settings incoming settings imap server imap gmail com port security type ssl always outgoing settings smtp server smtp gmail com port security type ssl always now that your account is set up learn how actions in your client sync with gmail

95461 you need to install physical keyboard layouts one of the best extensions to do that is this rs hardware keyboard layouts it is free and does nothing else you use the standard settings page to select the hardware keyboard layout it is mystery why google does not provide the layout files by default
95679 there is no singularly defined android filesystem so this can vary between devices any fs that the kernel can load drivers for is basically fair game by and large youll almost certainly find that ext4 is the most common filesystem on modern devices older devices may use older ext versions as well or other filesystems entirely since everything is built on linux ext4 pretty sensible choice with solid kernel support and good track record you can read bit about why this decision was made in ars technicas article about the switch to ext4 some devices have also used samsungs flash friendly file system f2fs notably several of motorolas devices as well as the nexus use f2fs the goal of f2fs was to create file system that was designed specifically with the needs of flash based storage mediums in mind in an attempt to maximize performance on devices using nand chips for their primary storage medium this does not mean that these are the only filesystems that android is capable of running on however as noted above given the kernel source and the know how it would certainly be possible to include drivers for other filesystems in kernel image android x86 supports installation on ntfs and fat32 filesystems for example

95766 simply run the uptime command inside terminal eg via adb or through terminal emulator you will get an output telling you how long the device is running for since the last boot example output up time idle time sleep time up time as you may have expected its the time since boot idle time currently dont know much about where this time comes from how it is generated it seems to be the time it was idling in the past hours sleep time seems to be broken is the time get even though the phone was asleep most of the time
95830 go to settings about phone status and scroll to the end of the options youll see the up time
95980 sorry but you have to root in order to do this there is no other way root optional install titanium backup and backup your phone if you mess something up you can restore your phone using this now use an app called system app remover to select the app you want to delete you will have to grant superuser permission for it to work

96297 just reproduced the steps needed to do this last two steps may be the interesting ones open google chrome v39 start large download http ipv4 download thinkbroadband com 1gb zip wait moment it took some seconds for notification to appear pull down the notification bar and click on the download entry you are taken to the download manager long click on the corresponding entry choose the trash bin from the top action bar in case this does not work for you please edit your answer with your exact device model chrome and android version number if you are doing lot of downloads on your android device consider installing download manager like share downloader it also supports pause and resume
96486 bluetooth low energy devices can be used for smart lock but they need to be paired at os level and it seems that the fitbit uses some kind of pseudo pairing at app level from the fitbit manual unlike standard bluetooth devices like headsets your fitbit tracker will be set up directly through the fitbit app and not through your android devices bluetooth pairing settings
96561 solution okay first of all you have to scan the qr code with the scanner that is built in whatsapp not with some 3rd party scanner app click on whatsapp web then the scanner opens immediately but apparently there is problem with devices that have display smaller than inches like with my sony xperia go inches cant tap on the ok got it button to make the instructions of the built in scanner go away thats it they will have to solve this problem in later version guess
96938 no currently there is no way to recover those previously downloaded videos reason offline feature rather counts as cache so its not considered as your data and since you restored phone assuming it to be factory reset what it basically does is to wipe the content specially from the cache holding the application cache and data user data and user installed apps dalvik cache partitions caution you will loose all downloaded offline youtube videos when you uninstall updates of youtube app asked similar question here when too found that my offline videos from youtube gone missing
97214 you can achieve this natively on some versions of android for me it works on kitkat all you have to do is connect the phone to wi fi as usual and then connect the usb cable and do usb tether your computer should detect new hardware usb ethernet or similar you may need to install drivers for that ymmv then it behaves just like any other network card this works for all common operating system including windows where the drivers part may apply just to be sure you can disable mobile data on the phone for the time being but the phone should be smart enough to route traffic via wifi automatically when it is available no root needed
97229 aptoide is known piracy site for android apps if you think any site that knowingly distributes pirated software is safe you are being pretty optimistic
97270 no one seems to have said pushbullet yet its trivially easy to share webpage to pushbullet from phone and push it to the windows mac app or chrome extension and the chrome extension only needs clicks to share any link whether its the page youre on or link you can right click
97377 after paulos answer some more mail exchanges with him already wrote detailed description in my answer to another question and also in an article on my own site android markets how safe are alternative sources following that kept close watch on aptoide ever since then and still do so let me add few more details including some points already mentioned before for context aptoide is not single area for apps like google play or the amazon app store its rather comparable to what launchpad is for ubuntu everyone and his little sister can open their own repository here which is presented as store separated from the others theres global search for apps and stores though theres only one repository which is manually curated by aptoide itself called apps here the aptoide team decides what apps are entering the repository here didnt find single pirated payed app be it for money or for free checked the signatures of some apps and found them matching those from google play for all checked dont remember any app without the trusted stamp meaning the so marked app has been checked for malware with multiple scanners including aptoides own bouncer signatures have been verified to match those of other markets mostly google play and more see my already mentioned other answer for details on this so my conclusion is in fact it is pretty safe to use this repository however ive also taken look at several of the other repositories where you indeed can find lots of obviously pirated apps payed apps from gplay for free are always signal for that at those places not only was the trusted stamp missing often but instead frequently found the untrusted stamp which means the app was probably contamined details differed most often found the signature to be the issue it was used elsewhere to sign another developers package is sure to indicate hack summed up general answer cannot be given here that would be answering the question whether the earth is safe place to live how safe it is to use aptoide pretty much depends on your choice of the repository one is known to be manually curated and dare say as safe as google play amazon app store and others few can be assumed as pretty safe especially if you know so about their owners and stick to apps showing the trusted shield avoid apps not being assigned the currently green trusted shield especially stay well clear of those showing the currently yellow untrusted shield best also stick to the apps repository alone and aptoide should be safe place for you consider the apps repository safe enough to link it from my app lists next to droid and google play
98998 toggling the syncing of gmail for the account is the best option turning of gmail sync on google account in android does not prevent you from fetching mail for that account via method such as pull to refresh when you are viewing that account in the gmail app use synker to integrate with tasker though know there are other apps that expose tasker control of specific sync settings on an account by account basis the basic outline have is as follows profile named work whose conditions are combination of time 9am 5pm and date mon fri it has the same entry and exit task task named work that has two items one to set the sync options of my work google account to have gmail sync on that is conditional on if pactive work one to set the sync options of my work google account to not sync gmail if pactive work if want to read work email when sync is not on for that account just open gmail switch to that account and swipe down pull to refresh fetching the messages from the server
99062 just had the same issue go to settings security install from storage locate your certificate file and install it edit if instead of install from storage preference you have install from sd card this is what being displayed when you use api emulator for example then one extra step required because in this case the activity shows only recent and downloads menus without simple way to pick the certificate from the sdcard the workaround for me was to put the certificate on my desktops local web server mongoose for example then on emulator used the stock browser to open the web directory tapped on certificate see below and selected save link the file will be downloaded and shown in downloads view and you will be able to pick it successfully

102551 as existing answers already show there seems to be no unique way to achieve that so started combining ideas from allover joining them into script or rather script library to have them checked sequentially until good hit was made and integrated that into my device documentation tool named adebar those interested can find it in the lib partitions lib file as adebar is open source gplv2 feel free to copy and use it or fork the project and improve it the full solution is bit long to post here as said you can grab it at github but as our policy is to include at least the general part in the post heres what it does different sources provide different sets of details so it tries the best ones first and then recurses down until at least something was found proc dumchar info gives the most details so this is tried first happy mtk users will get this proc mtd is the second best source proc emmc should have almost as much as the previous candidates but is bit tricky to use dev block platform by name cross checked with proc partitions cross checked with proc mounts gives us at least the partitions mounted so the script ive built basically walks the sources in this order stopping as soon as it was able to collect details if proc dumchar info was found no need to parse all the others all of them put into separate functions returning data using the very same structure one could even merge results from all of them if someone can come up with better solution im of course always open for the idea
103167 as mentioned in another answer on devices that use fuse for sd card emulation such as modern nexus devices only root can change timestamps of files in sdcard since things like mtp and adb dont run as root you cant preserve the timestamps with these methods however if your device is rooted you can fix the timestamps with separate step afterward while restoring full backup of sdcard from linux pc to my tablet used this command to fix all the timestamps after uploading the files with adb push find while read file do timestamp stat stat file timestamp date timestamp stat echo timestamp file adb shell su touch timestamp sdcard file done this should be run from the root of the directory on the pc that corresponds to sdcard on the device or if you uploaded something other than full sdcard backup change the path in the touch command near the end but you should run this from whatever directory on the pc corresponds to the directory in the touch command the way it works is that it goes through all the files on the pc side gets the timestamp of each and runs touch command as root on the device to set the timestamp of the corresponding file there note that this will run separate su command for each individual file if you have logging enabled in your root program supersu you may want to disable that to avoid producing large numbers of log entries and if you have your device configured to prompt for confirmation on every su request youll probably want to change that temporarily it may be possible to come up with variation that pipes stream of touch commands into single root shell on the device but the straightforward way of doing that didnt work when tried it and didnt want to spend much time on it ive used this with success on nexus running android
103226 the accepted answer turned out incorrect or outdated the app settings module for the xposed app allows you to specify on per app basis to keep apps from being killed or freed http repo xposed info module de robv android xposed installer http repo xposed info module de robv android xposed mods appsettings responsible care should of course be exercised when playing with apps changing such low level behaviour

104153 came across this solution when was looking to recover tabs that had been permanently closed after my browser crashed one day in order to access the information you require your device needs to be rooted so you can run file explorer app with access to the root files installed on your device es file explorer or root explorer are my recommendations navigate to the root folder of your device the protected system partition select data select com android chrome there are several places where you may find information about your current tabs the first folder to check is app tabs then in this folder there should be file called tab state which contains list of all your current tabs there are also other files in this folder called tab3 tab4 etc that contain info about current tabs imo you need special text editor sql editor to read the content of some of these files as the encoding is different next place to look is data com android chrome app chrome default in this folder youll find file called history depending on your situation you may find good list of recent site visits here finally navigate to the sync data folder in here you will find the information thats being synced to google and this should include all the tabs you currently have synced on other devices in the file syncdata sqlite3 youll also find history of all your google searches which sometimes find to be an interesting read youll need an sqlite3 data browser program on your pc in order to read this file the app should be able to export to highly usable csv or xls file that you can open in ms excel this could be helpful to someone assume

104322 they use real time clock the same as just about any other electronic device that keeps time newer devices have largely begun to move to supercapacitors to power the rtc but batteries are also used the decision depends on variety of factors including space and relative cost of the components if you want some really in depth details on how an rtc might be designed texas instruments has published the specifications for the various rtcs used in their chipsets here is the spec for one of their omap systems on chip warning pdf file
104587 an app has to declare all its permissions requirements because they are granted to it at installation see the section using permissions here http developer android com guide topics security permissions html
104588 will android tell me what permissions they require before installation in general yes in most if not all android devices theres system app called package installer which handles the installation upgrade of an app when you install an apk file from unknown source this app will run and show all permissions the app requests which looks like this package installer on kitkat will android block functions that use permissions not noted in the manifest of non google play apps during installation android doesnt check test if function requires specific permission to run in other word user can still install the app however the app will throw securityexception that may crash behave unpredictably do nothing depends on how its handled when running the function that needs permission but is not declared in the manifest file this applies to all apps regardless from where its installed example doing network operation without declaring uses permission android name android permission internet will crash the app with stack trace androidruntime18698 caused by java lang securityexception permission denied missing internet permission
104830 with changelog droid being currently out of order let me mention an alternative app watcher claims to do the very same app watcher notifies you about updates of applications from play store even the app is not installed currently on your device and provides quick access to the whats new section app watcher source google play click images for larger variants according to comment from winchendonsprings by response ive got from the dev hes quite busy with other tasks at the moment but did not abandon the app he still plans to update it but cannot give an estimate
104844 according to google google play services provides you with easy access to google services and is tightly integrated with the android os and from the description in the play store google play services is used to update google apps and apps from google play this component provides core functionality like authentication to your google services synchronized contacts access to all the latest user privacy settings and higher quality lower powered location based services google play services also enhances your app experience it speeds up offline searches provides more immersive maps and improves gaming experiences apps may not work if you uninstall google play services wouldnt recommend removing it

106037 basically speaking you cant at least not without rooting the main reasons android does not allow you to install an application to your external sd card are security its the main reason for that restriction basic file systems like ntfs or fat any version of it do not allow for unix like permission management this means any application would be able to write to any file on that storage thinking of malicious apps they would be able to replace proper apps with fake infected ones bricking your phone and rendering it unusable volatile storage your external sd card is not safe to be inserted in your device all the time you are able to eject it any time what makes your sd card not very good candidate for permanent storage consider apps running off of your sd card and you eject it those apps will just crash and all other apps saved on your sd card are gone as well you cant use them at that time and the data of those app is also affected by reason
106038 basically you can first root your phone second create secondary partition in your sd card ext 2gb and set it as primary third download and install link2sd app from playstore open the app and will ask you to create mount point to your 2nd partition select yes reboot after reboot every app you install will automatically go to sd card if you dont know how to create partition search for guide in google there are plenty of them
106278 it looks like there is an issue with hangouts app that causes notifications for new conversations with given contact to be disabled by default with no way to override this setting on the conversations tab these are denoted by bell with strike through click for larger image once you open such conversation you will see message in red saying notifications off you wont be notified of new messages with an option to enable them click for larger image existing conversations for which youve enabled this setting will receive notifications normally if you delete the conversation the setting will revert to off archiving the conversation keeps it enabled the details that are described in this thread suggest starring it to show google that there is interest in this issue match exactly what you are experiencing it has been brought up before and was escalated to the hangouts development team who are already aware of the issue we can only guess when or if google will fix this

106468 adb and fastboot require different usb drivers whilst you may see your device under adb when your phone is on it will not be detected by fastboot until you install the driver for it and hence will show waiting for device you can follow the steps below to do so open your device manager and reboot your device into fast boot by pressing volume up down and power button simultaneously you will notice that device manager refreshes and now your phone has yellow icon download the google usb driver it is zip file so go ahead and unzip it in your local directory right click on the yellow triangle for your device and update driver select the option update from local storage and select the folder usb driver under extracted files in previous step you are good to go now fastboot oem unlock will detect the device now

108684 similar to scoobydos answer disconnect the usb cable from phone click clear data on the media storage application then force stop reconnect the usb cable to phone the media storage application is restarted and rebuilds the media list missing files are now available this avoids rebooting which was important for me your mileage may vary
108927 in general cache is temporary files one example might be thumbnails for contacts in social media app these can be cleared without any major effect the app can just download them again when it needs to and if space is low the android os may remove cache files itself data is the important information this might include credentials and settings that you generally want the app to remember
108975 app developers decide what information to be kept in data and what to be kept in cache usually data is used for account info settings saved activity data game scores and whatever is need to be kept permanently clearing data will make your app forget everything like you have reinstalled it cache holds all information and files that can be retrieved somehow from the internet or other way for example social apps can cache all your feed data photos comments and so on clearing cache may lead your app to reload all the lost and necessary data from its original source it shouldnt make your app behave bad

110497 updated answer check if you have hidden file named nomedia double check also for uppercase name on device memory storage folder and delete go to settings apps all media storage select clear data clear defaults disable the app reboot the device now enable again settings apps all media storage wait couple of minutes so it should reindex files think all files should be now again in gallery note do not try to run any rescan app just follow the above steps old answer the error you got in logcat is related to specific function for processing scaling up images it is known fact binder transaction buffer has limited and fixed memory 1mb this buffer is used by all transactions and shared across process for if you have big number of large images files and some of them are corrupted either by poor bad transfer via computer and device computer and sd card and so on or some of them are not recognized by your app in your case gallery once this app tries to create thumbnails or previews for your files and actually scale down up one of those files the process may fail the same case must be with number of files like ringtones or wav diles or ogg or any type of music which have problems either in content size signature because you said the problem comes back suspect this kind of strange behavior from your apps dont even think to bug in kernel or something like this so for your own safety try to put back all those files on your pc clear from sd card phone memory verify in pc for the bad files then put back correct files in your device take in consideration this fact also gif jpg png or whatever kind of image you have may be rendered as correct in your computer or device but actually may have bad content disrupted content remember all operation related to process images inside your android device are based on compress decompress them for the most common operations and those are made bit by bit if can say so forcing an app to render incorrect type or content wrong height width file lenght should outcast transactiontoolargeexception this is what mediascanner throws in logcat

110876 in order for bluetooth device to work with smartlock it needs to be constantly connected while its within range of your phone dedicated smart watches bluetooth speakers and your cars bluetooth are constantly connected to your phone to pass data calls texts music notifications for lack of better term the bluetooth connectivity is active always connected for these devices fitbit on the other hand only connects periodically and only for few seconds to sync health data so basically bluetooth connectivity is in sleep mode disconnected until the timer activates bluetooth to sync health data and then disconnects again after its done there is an option for your fitbit device to notify you of incoming calls however this still doesnt maintain bluetooth connectivity when you get call your phone temporarily activates bluetooth to send the signal and then disconnects this is why your fitbit gets delayed notification instead of an instant notification like true smart watch which has permanent bluetooth connectivity
110918 even though there already are many answers there is actually none answering two main questions and the third one just for case of dumpstate problem read just bigger text if youre in hurry also ill explain why solutions mentioned in other answers help only sometimes and offer another solution in case cat is not your problem why do get storage space error if there is lot of available space its not an error its by design the trigger for low space is quite high usually or 500mb whichever is lower some system functions may not work thats not precise some will not work synchronize some download functions installing apps hangouts and many google apps if youll ask why there is less than 500mb available then the answer is that its either that you used it up unknowingly or that there is problem with something stuffing up your storage space if you used it up and want to check with what follow the answers saying clean up your space if you didnt it might be variety of other problems but most likely its logcat which is leaving huge dumpstate files behind in that case follow the answers mentioning logcat or log or dumpstate or jump to my last paragraph below which parts of memory are monitored for free space we may distinguish two model situations according to the fs structure in an android phone note that what call internal storage is not standardized name usually its weirdly called sdcard might also be called usb storage as it possibly is in your case data partition is separate partition from internal storage internal storage is not monitored and you can fill it up to zero free bytes and nothing happens data storage is monitored on galaxy s2 its from mb 150mb must be always available one partition for both data and internal storage internal storage is emulated as separate partition with different permission rights it also has fuse or reserve which will not allow all space of the real partition be used files on internal storage are actually located in data media old models maybe up to android v2 also has dbdata partition which was separately monitored if remember this correctly change from one system to another might have been done by fw update still remember when such update removed thousands of my holiday pictures on galaxy note2 an internal storage partition was removed and mounted on data partition using fuse there was 100mb difference when checked free space on each so depending on data structure you have you need to keep for example 400mb of free space on an internal storage which might using df or free space analyzer app show as 500mb free space on data partition note that the minimum size is different for each model and sometimes also fw version you need to wait for about minute to see if the notification will clear itself after you make some more space available second question can join device and and usb memory will it help or at least delay the time while the problem return fast answer no and if it would help yes it would help to avoid the problem of low space by means of having bigger total storage to elaborate if usb memory is pluggable sd card or pluggable device in your case or if its located on separate memory chip as its on tab and phones from similar age then its not possible to join it with data partition if usb memory is an internal storage in your case you can join them but its not an easy or safe process in other words if there is not guide by someone who have successfully done that on the same model of phone as is yours we might also figuratively say no its not possible while searching the internet for the guide be aware that it wasnt clever idea to name the internal storage as usb storage because there is also real usb storage youll find lot of solutions for enabling usb for storage drives so called usb otg feature dont get diversed basically you need to re partition your memory chip called emmc for some reason delete userdata what is partition name for internal storage and merge the freed space with data partition then find compile fuse module which would take care of emulating the partition with full permissions for media rw or some other user edit init script to create mount point for new internal storage many more changes and tweaks which cant think of third question any other advice how can deal with this problem the best option if you have root access is to lower the threshold of the minimum free space you can put it down to possibly even less that means 120mb of minimum free space it involves sqlite3 editing but although it might look difficult its very straightforward process just follow any good guide and youll do it alright this guide looks splendid or there also are sqlite3 editor apps or find another guide using this gugl link there are two things to note different guides are mentioning different table names secure system global or even gservices the truth is it was applicable in different tables through different android versions now it should be in global before it was in secure and before that system my advice is just put it in all of them you will not hurt anything that means follow the guide youll find and repeat the steps while replacing the table name with each of those names mentioned above you might find settings db file locked and not writable even with root it happened to me when ics came out but didnt happened since anyway in that case boot into recovery pull the file out edit on pc and push back in if around 100mb if you have 16gb chip is still too much for you to waste as it was for me add sys storage threshold max bytes value too have around mb and never had much of problem although many apps dont have available space checking and will error without stating the reason so you need to keep in mind it might always be free space issue there is or statement between those two variables dont put less than there because if certain system file which resides in data folder will fail to write your phone might not boot find 20mb quite safe as there are no files larger than that in data while excepting data data data app and dalvik and if file will get broken in data data no big deal data reset of that app will solve it if something is eating up the free space if you suspect that there shouldnt be so much space taken or you just want to clean up space as in couple of other answers here also recommend diskusage to help with the job of visually locating what is taking how much space in the diskusage app in the second column the media stands for internal storage and apps represent data app and data data space taken by apps the system data in green color on the bottom is the rest of data folder and shouldnt be too high 300mb is fine over 1gb is probably problem if this system data is too high its possible your logcat has gone wild and created tons of dumpstate postmortem poems in that case and only in that case will all of the other answers here be applicable meaning that deleting this gigs of wasted space in folder data log or dialing which by the way is not valid command for every device will bring your android back to good mood for how long is question of whether the culprit which caused the excessive logging has been patched or removed
110940 this solution requires tasker installed and enabled tested on android and create profile with application maps create an action under task of the above profile as display display autorotate and set it to on enable profile and tasker open maps and orient your device in landscape mode maps will follow you close the maps and device will fall back to portrait enjoy or edit start there is way you can force the system to go into landscape mode by changing value in settings db tested on android root required only under this edit create profile with application maps create an action under task of the above profile as code run shell and enter the following details command settings put system user rotation check use root create another profile with inverse of application maps create an action under task of the above profile as code run shell and enter the following details command settings put system user rotation check use root enable both profiles and tasker the maps will now automatically go into landscape mode irrespective of manual orientation of your device once you close it the device will come back to portrait mode note that op has auto rotation feature off so it should work this edit is meant for users like me who on slow devices have to wait for the app to follow their orientation enjoy or the shortcoming in the last method is that on some devices the app will first open in portrait mode and then will force shift into landscape mode however the app can be directly launched into landscape mode by using an app shortcut tasker allows it and well use it go to your default launcher widgets and choose task shortcut select new task name it create an action as code run shell and enter the following details command settings put system user rotation check use root create another action as app launch app select maps to change th icon of the shortcut tap 3x3 square icon at the bottom of task shortcut window and choose the icon youll now see shortcut with icon you selected in step and name chosen in step create profile in tasker with inverse of application maps create an action under task of the above profile as code run shell and enter the following details command settings put system user rotation check use root enable both profiles and tasker now enjoy the forced auto mode edit closed for folks whore new to tasker launch tasker note that once youre done changing something in tasker tap back key once tasker will change close the active window and would save the settings under profiles tab tap application choose maps new task name it something and tap right icon some android versions might ask you to enable taskers accessibility service do it by following the instructions there and come back to tasker this step would create profile that will be triggered whenever maps is launched by the user were now under the named task inside tasks tab tap display display autorotate choose on below set were creating an action here which will be executed once the profile is triggered come back to main screen of the tasker and youll see profile with maps app name and marked as on minimize the tasker and youll see its icon in the notification bar it will say no active profile the message will change once you launch maps well launch maps and see the magic you orient your device and maps will do the same you close the maps and device will come back to portrait mode you can always stop this behavior by disabling or deleting the profile in tasker you can also hide taskers notification icon through its settings enjoy maps now
110942 if you are rooted and probably not using lollipop then you can also use xposed module app settings open the module search and open maps and go to orientation section and select auto rotate this will force it to auto rotate

111529 no you dont need to wipe it it is probably still in recoveries because you could need it at some point or developers just didnt remove it yet for me dalvik cache folder is empty
111536 the dalvik cache is still in use under art it is the location where the oat files they contain the compiled application compiled during installation are stored they just didnt change the name source so wiping may be necessary if art related files were updated because it does no harm other than compiling all applications again suggest just doing it to be safe
111841 that might be solved using one of the many automation apps myself prefer tasker here but ymmv and tasker doesnt come for free llama might be capable of the same what do here is creating profile like this condition app select the apps you want to use gps with task gps on optional exit task gps off that way gps by default is off but automatically gets turned on whenever you launch one of the selected apps and have them running in foreground it would automatically be turned off once you exit that app or have any other app running in foreground the exit task is optional as tasker restores the conditions from before the profile became active for other alternative automation apps youre also welcome to take look at my list here
111843 as izzy said in the answer tasker is great choice but its not free for anyone tried automateitfree and it gets the job done edit this answer is successfully tested on android without giving root access to automateit however on android cos12 android and cm12 android build yog7dao1k6 the relevant options were not visible until restarted the app with root access this fact came to my notice through this comment by jonatr install and launch automateit go to my rules all and see if you need any predefined rules if you dont then either disable or delete by tapping each entry once and selecting the desired option tap corresponding to my rules tab application status trigger tap lens icon and choose your app maps here check application activated next enable disable gps action enable gps next choose default or no to show or not toast whenever automation will be triggered tap floppy icon at the top to save everything repeat steps except that uncheck application activated in step this time now you can open the maps and location will be enabled you close the maps and location will be disabled you can do more with it if you certainly want to disable location say minutes after minimizing the maps honestly ill prefer tasker because need fewer steps and know it doesnt hog my battery check it out if automateit eats the battery quite lot
112054 details for that can be found in our usb debugging tag wiki where ive just added them by default usb debugging is disabled with stock roms some custom roms however have it enabled by default to toggle it on or off you can find the corresponding switch in settings development section originally hidden with android and up you can make this section visible by going to settings about device and hammering the entry telling your roms build version until toast message congratulates you for having become developer if your issue is however that you cannot boot up your device normally and thus cannot reach the settings section described above please take look at the following questions how to backup broken screen phone when usb debugging is not enabled broken screen while debug mode was disabled how can re enable adb
112111 based on ops clarification done in the comments below izzys answer propose the following solution if ones device is locked out and adb is not enabled under settings note that this method is tested on stock android and stock cm android both devices having custom recovery adb always enabled as default if your stock recovery allows adb shell access then you may also consider this solution instructions you should try your pattern cracking software or whatsoever the genre it has from inside the stock recovery to see whether it works with the formers environment adb shell available there or not since would never try step would do the following for jellybean boot into recovery and mount data partition open shell on pc and type adb pull data property persist sys usb config repace with home directory of your os open that file in text editor and you would possibly see mtp written there change it to mtpadb note that sometimes android doesnt understand the text file changes if the line terminator is dos terminators which notepad would probably do on windows mine is linux so no issue here in that case would suggest not using adb pull but doing adb shell echo mtpadb data property persist sys usb config you may verify that the echo command overwrote the file by using adb pull data property persist sys usb config and seeing the files content in some text editor unmount data and reboot into android os usb debugging would probably be enabled for lollipop jb users can also follow this method if the previous one didnt work for them boot into recovery and mount data partition repeat step and used in jb method we need to tweak some parameters in settings db type adb pull data data com android providers settings databases settings db back it up at some other location too and open the file in an sqlite editor im running linux and db browser for sqlite works well its also available for windows os osx in the global table change the value for adb enabled to development settings enabled to check that verifier verify adb installs is set to in the global table check that as default in the secure table adb notify is adb port is these checks in step and are not necessary but should be done so that troubleshooting becomes rather easy if the solution doesnt work for you save the changes in settings db and copy it back into android by typing adb shell rm data data com android providers settings databases settings db exit adb push settings db data data com android providers settings databases that delete rm command is not necessary since adb push should overwrite the file but executed it for my peace of mind unmount data and reboot into android os adb probably would be enabled this is how it actually worked out when tested on my devices source not really source but got hint from comment under this answer
112461 non root option is now available the headsoff app can disable all lollipop heads up notifications on your phone it can also disable heads up notifications only for selected apps if you purchase the pro key you can restore the ticker text in the status bar to see little notification preview
112693 if youve got access to terminal on your phone guess that requires being rooted then you can also run ip neigh show dev wlan0 to see whats in the arp tables that should tell you the mac addresses and ip addresses of everything connected

113402 am sorry but this is not possible during apk installation even via adb managed by the android package manager on the device various processes are executed such as determine the appropriate location of the package installation copying copy of the apk file to given directory usually data app create the application directory and set permissions to store database and shared preference native library usually data data extraction of dex code to the cache directory there is no way an apk can run on an android device if its resources and configuration are not on the same device

114041 in the android developer preview for shamu nexus and possibly other builds of this os the captive portal server global is used by the os regardless of the state of captive portal detection enabled in order to determine health of wifi network for wifi networks it will not only draw an exclamation mark on the strength icon it will blacklist that ssid from auto reconnecting if it does not successfully curl the url specified in the the captive portal server global via that ssid manual reconnection is allowed but will only remain connected if you have captive portal detection enabled and choose use this network as is manually each time you connect to that wifi ssid this override is temporary for mobile provider networks the captive portal server is only used to draw an exclamation mark on the strength icon but will remain connected and traffic will flow if the connection is functional on your rooted device the solution is to re enable captive portal detection enabled if you have disabled it connect to that wifi network select use this network as is from the drop down menu in the captive portal pop up disable your mobile network data to focus on determining website that can be retrieved via your wifi network by logging in to your captive portal and then use browser to find one that works after that you can disable captive portal detection enabled to prevent the annoying pop up to reenable your captive portal detection if you previously disabled it issue the command settings put global captive portal detection enabled disable your mobile network under settings data usage mobile data off to force the phone to use the wifi network for all traffic temporarily this will not be required once you have all of your settings where they need to be android seems to require website that loads successfully and does not actively return no content couple of options include but are not limited to androidcheck kiritostudio com captive apple com www textise net the network router localhost if you have an onboard simple http server and the list goes on after finding one that works for your wifi network often requires more imagination and attempts behind corporate web gateway proxies that do not like https traffic prior to authentication you can save the server save the server by running this in your root enabled terminal app replacing the example url with the one you are hoping will work settings put global captive portal server androidcheck kiritostudio com restart your device try it out once you are happy with the behavior of the exclamation marks on the icons the final step is to disable the captive portal pop up which is one of the most unfortunate inventions of this decade issue command settings put global captive portal detection enabled if you find yourself in different country or wifi situation where issues arise unfortunately you will need to repeat the above from the beginning reenabling captive portal detection enabled restarting finding the right server and then disabling the portal detection afterwards
114173 no there is no way to open the exo file since it is encrypted and the video file is split into chunks of exo files even if you have one offline video stored in your phone you can find more than one exo file under internal storage android data com youtube com directory they are nothing but the encrypted exo files that can only be opened through the youtube app from the xda developers forum post google is using exo file format to save videos this is apparently file format used for system files and while we managed to copy these exo files onto computer it can be apparently played only through the youtube android app when you request download for an offline video in the youtube app the video is downloaded in chunks for example minute file we downloaded was saved in five parts it is possible that only the youtube app for android can make sense of these chunks and join them together we also feel there is real time encryption going on here when the video is downloaded not only it is broken into parts but is also converted to exo format compressed and encrypted in real time this has several benefits the one obvious benefit is that people cant copy paste the video and share it indiscriminately the compression meanwhile saves space on the disk for example the minute long video that we downloaded actually consumed around 40mb data but when stored on the phone the video took only around 25mb space when user plays the video it is decrypted in real time it is possible that only youtubes app can do this decryption if you share the offline video using bluetooth instead of the actual file web link to the video is sent to the recipient however you may want to look into this exoplayer library on github and see if that helps exoplayer is an application level media player for android it provides an alternative to android mediaplayer api for playing audio and video both locally and over the internet
114798 on some android versions you can use adb to disable apps that you would otherwise not be able to deactivate via the ui the debloater app linked to above automates and simplifies this process this answer will explain how to perform the same process manually warning disabling the wrong app or using the wrong commands can leave your device soft bricked please make sure you know what you are doing before proceeding make sure youve got android debugging set up correctly then drop into an adb shell adb shell get list of all installed packages by using pm pm list packages identify the packages you want to disable and make note of them disable each package individually by running one of the following commands if you are on kitkat pm block package name pm block com motorola motocare if you are on lollipop pm hide package name pm hide com motorola motocare the app should now be disabled and disappear from your launcher in case of background service it will permanently stop running in the background to reverse this procedure you can use one of the following commands if you are on kitkat pm unblock package name pm unblock com motorola motocare if you are on lollipop pm unhide package name pm unhide com motorola motocare
115038 discovered that it was not necessary to mount it it was sufficient to extract it with tar xf archive name but this particular app doesnt install
115198 have spent weeks looking for solution to this and finally this post helped me it was so far from obvious and it felt like google wanted me to keep the account by force lol anyway what did was go to settings accounts google clicked the account wanted to delete the sync menu option opened and this is where always got stuck through this realized had to press and hold the menu button on the bottom left side of my s4 to get another menu pop up with the options of canceling sync or deleting the account finally hope this helped

115603 if you use linux download heimdall frontend so you can use gui it is much easier to flash using heimdall you first need to specify pit file pit stands for partitions information tables so heimdall knows where it need to flash it to flash twrp using heimdall follow this steps open heimdall frontend go to utilities tab you will see download pit go save as and save it on some location go to flash tab in pit category click browse and select pit file you downloaded from device in step click add button for partition name select where you want to flash it be careful if you flash it on wrong partition you can perma brick device on my device for recovery it is kernel2 go browse for file and select img file in session let everything unchecked click start note1 repartition must stay unchecked note2 this can brick device be careful here on site we do not hold responsibility for your device note3 if youre on windows just use odin
115664 this is not final answer as it is not generic only works on some devices but its start at least as weve figured out at least cm based roms with kitkat android and above ship with the aapt binary available in system bin1 if your rom doesnt have it and installing the binary on the device is an option you can find it here using aapt retrieving the app name is possible with aapt badging path to apk grep application label awk print the output will be something like label funny app which you then easily can parse for the app name aapt badging path to apk grep application label sed label not good if the app name contains single quotes but that might count as cosmetics or you figure how to improve the sed part to deal with that we didnt find this in the kitkat and above stock roms weve checked so it might be cm based roms only
115790 in windows if you open manage password in chrome then it asks for master password windows admin password to view and manage your passwords but thats not the case in android so for security purposes chrome for android doesnt reveal the password from greenbot saving your passwords to your device presents some obvious security issues although chrome won show your password all bets are off if someone gets ahold of your phone they ll be able to log into any account that chrome remembers if you choose to have chrome remember your passwords you ll also want to set passcode on your phone or better yet encrypt your device to reduce the risk of your internet accounts falling onto the wrong hands based on this help link to manage you password in chrome browser for android open the chrome app touch chrome menu menu touch settings save passwords touch the link for manage saved passwords in your google account however following the above steps only reveals the username and the website url and you can delete the password but not view it in order to manage view your passwords from any device browser visit https passwords google com and re enter you google account password to login and to view all your saved passwords except your currently signed in google account password wont be displayed if you ve signed in to chrome and saved passwords or you re using google smart lock for passwords on android click on the specific website and select the eye symbol to reveal the password for that particular site update if you are having rooted device you can try firelords answer too
116493 to mitigate this attack ive disabled mmses since dont use them anyway you can do that in the settings menu select cellular networks access points names select your access point and remove mms from apn type ive also cleared out mmsc click image to enlarge hover the image to know the instruction order of instructions follow images from left to right in each row note that android converts group smses to mmses so you might want to disable that too to do that go to the messaging app open the settings menu and disable group messaging and auto retrieve
116572 the newest version of hangouts mitigates this issue it looks like it does some extra checks before passing the media on to the system service it doesnt fix the underlying issue in the system though you can also disable mms auto retrieve in hangouts via its settings sms uncheck auto retrieve mms or in messenger via its settings advanced disable auto retrieve under mms this site has detailed steps if you need them
116675 this is not just about mms or web surfing since stagefright is the library that helps phones to unpack multimedia messages see media and this article on fortune so it is about any application including your web browser that works with multimedia video clips and audio records mms is just an easiest way to exploit it because your phone will not ask you before downloading it that is why you also need to think about all other applications working with multimedia and never open any multimedia attachments before the fix is not installed on your phone for the web browser you could switch to firefox or higher then you could continue opening web pages with video and or audio content to summarise disable auto retrival of mms in your messaging app whatever it is guide with images switch to firefox or later find it in your market app store switch to filesystem manager hiding video thumbnails which is the default for total commander switch to video player that is immune the video player mx player make sure to activate its hw setting for all video formats pointed out by hulkingtickets do not open any multimedia files or draw video thumbnails in any other applications and block automatic opening downloading of them in all apps if possible this is very important if your phone is not patched and you use any app with multimedia content and there is no option to block automatic opening of multimedia in this app example for browser if you open some random web page you browser should preload videos if they are on this web page then stop using this app and block internet access for this app if you cant delete the app if this app is important to you and you cant update phone firmware or block multimedia in this app just stop using your phone and buy another one which is not vulnerable yes this means that in the worst case you need to change the phone stagefright is very serious vulnerability affecting billion devices so you could easily become victim of automated attack that is not done directly against you but directed to all billion users install updates if you have cyanogenmod or fixed on see commits on github edit fixes from were incomplete you may need to update again after fix on edit fixes on were again incomplete you need to update one more time after fixes from google in october so called stagefright if you have adroid or you may need to update again after these next fixes from google in november since there are similarly dangerous vulnerabilities cve and cve that are probably not called stagefright anymore please note that the time of actual fix from your manufacturer could be later or at least different cm11 got updated on while cm12 got updated on edit more stagefright vulnerabilities are reported by google at however they only affect adroid wait for update from your manufacturer edit2 similar with cyanogenmod an update from your manufacturer could be not enough due to the issue with initial integer overflow fix that was reported on original integer overflow fix ineffective so even after update it is recommended to check if your phone is still vulnerable using the app from zimperium finder of the stagefright issue zimperium stagefright detector app if you already has root try fix offered by goordie also see this howto guide edit tried this fix on samsung s4 mini and it did not work so think twice before rooting your phone
116773 the fix for me was using different micro usb cable no software change no drivers to update just the usb cable apparently they arent all created equal
117183 highly recommend mailwise it has an exchange override that allows you to turn off the servers influence over your device use it at your own risk your employer may get whiny about it but can say it does work very well in order to use the exchange security bypass youll need to go to mailwises faq and follow the instructions you basically just select the override option in settings menu enter in code supplied on the faq and re enter your exchange mail information dont bother making work account in mailwise until you do this as doing it deletes the old account and requires you to make new one once this is done you have total control again and your work admin cant force certain security measures on your device
117593 bootloader the low level implementation of system which can be used to flash software onto your phones partitions often used to flash root privileges or stock roms recovery the recovery is another system used to manage wipe reformat your partitions twrp refers to custom recovery which allows you to install custom roms in zip format the recovery follows the directions which are contained in the rom zip file rooting rooting describes the process of getting administrative privileges on your android phone you need those priviliges to mount your system partition as read and write so you can modify the files and settings most of the time you will have to boot your phone into the bootloader and then flash root file like the one from chainfire from your computer but there are also apps which can enable the root access by simple click for certain devices if you have further questions to specific device then you can head to the xda forum for your device and read its the most important thing to do before attempting to mess with your phones software
117598 ahh since you have no knowledge regarding rooting and all ill just explain in the simplest form imagine that you have bought laptop from hp which congress preloaded with windows installation and some pre stuff assume that normal person wouldt be bothered by it and the extra useless stuff they install on your laptop they prevent you from uninstalling them blocks access to directory and pretty much other things that some medium user would need so what he does is install new os any os mean windows or or linux and so he removes all the bloats and gets acces to many things now getting to the point that to install new os or rom in androids case you first need to unlock its bootloader now the bootloader does what it says and manages your boot preferences just like the bootloader and bootmanager in laptops as it doesnt need to be done in computer or laptop it is neccesary to unlock it to install custom recovery for your phone twrp is custom recovery like cwm and benefits of having custom recovery are many just like your windows recovery menu which let you reset your laptop or factory default it which just refreshes the window as it was just installed so recovery in phone is just like the pc one but having custom recovery is necessary as it provides lot more features now as got my meaning of bootloader and recovery and if you still dont get something you can just ask and now comes rooting as unlocking bootloader and installing custom recovery doesnt need rooting your phone rooting your phone allows you to get admin privileges just like in windows and now you can even tamper with the internal files you can root your phone with the android you got installed with your phone and dont need to install custom recovery and all as previously said that these things neednt be done for laptop but phone needs it to be done in order to install custom rom or rather saying an unofficial update or an official update which isnt available by some reasons so thats why you need to do these things and by the way could you tell us which phone are you trying to update as then we can check and tell you if you can update without going through all this hassle
118743 google keep is free application that allows you to take notes and create location or temporal reminders that will trigger the notes
118754 shifu is free android application available on google play store that lets you create reminders in most flexible ways apart from location based reminders that you require you can also set reminders on calls wi fi connectivity etc it has other interesting features too check it out
118786 you can do this via google now or even via browser just say remind me to buy ice cream the next time am at frys and the next time youre at frys it will remind you to get ice cream most of the google now features are available via any browser as well just search google for that same statement and it will offer to set reminder above real results real handy and should be available on any phone running jelly bean or higher so likely most phones released in the last years or so
118872 had exactly the same problem with the gps data on my android smartphone live in the uk and noticed that the altitude displayed was consistantly metres higher than the mapping showed too thought that this was lack in gps accuracy in fact the answer was that the gps was showing altitudes related to the wgs84 global spheroid whereas the uk maps all relate elevations to mean sea level hence the variance

119324 actually method is quite easy to do as implied by this answer you need more that one network connection for the sharing tab to appear short answer first ignore the instruction of your android device and try to connect to the usb internet anyway this will create new network connection and allow the sharing tab to appear on your pc network connection detailed answer prepare windows rightclick the windows start button in the opening context menu open network connections the network connections will show up as you can see theres currently only one network connection so there will be no sharing tab prepare your android device connect your android device with usb cable to your pc in the wireless networks section you might need to click on more on some android devices try to activate the usb internet instructions will appear select windows and just click on next and done ignoring the given instructions now there should be check mark after usb internet if this is the first time you are connecting your android device to your pc with usb network windows might ask you whether to grand the network connection thats normal share the internet connection on windows as you can see there are now two network connections so the sharing tab will be now available right click the first network connection and open the properties now theres sharing tab and you can allow your android device to use the internet connection of your windows pc
119610 note this method requires root access the credentials of the websites that you allowed chrome to save are stored in the file login data which is located inside the data directory of chrome data data com android chrome app chrome default certainly no app or even adb can access that location and neither chrome has any provision through gui to access them so non rooted devices are at quite loss luckys solution should help in that case anyhow for rooted device simply pull that file an sqlite database into pc and open it in an sqlite viewer like db browser for sqlite you may also open that file in text viewer know that the formatting wouldnt be pleasing if you do that and bit incomprehensible too or in an sqlite viewer app like sqlite editor or asqlitemanager or the command line sqlite3 the table logins has the credentials
119632 edit firstly please follow the answer here it offers an easier approach and is tested with android some users have reported that the following solution didnt work for android marshmallow and above that may be so since tested this with android lollipop and worked well on it yes and no it depends upon how you want to use this answer still see the guest account icon when pull down the top bar and click the blue user thing you dont need to go that far by completely disabling the guest user to avoid that guest account icon when you pull down the top bar and click your profile image all youve to do is remove all other users from settings users and change the value of key the key is guest user enabled under the table global found at data data com android providers settings databases settings db this database belongs to settings storage app its current value would be change it to using adb with the command adb shell settings put global guest user enabled changes should take place immediately otherwise simply restart the phone now whenever you would tap your profile image in the top bar you would see the profile contact if already created or toast saying the contact doesnt exist that icon wouldnt show itself as long as you dont create any more users note as noted above it is important to remove all other users since the said method wouldnt work as long as any secondary user remains in the system the aforesaid technique simply deals with the nuisance that icon is to some users it doesnt restrict the primary user owner to switch or create new user from settings users what if im happy with having single user me and dont want to see that user in the settings that would require root access there are devices under the banner android one which are now running android lollipop yet do not have multi user functionality it turned out that the multi user feature is disabled the feature is disabled using framework as noted here can be enabled using few entries in build prop why not use that technique for our advantage hide users from settings install file manager with root explorer feature or build prop editor app the location of build prop is system build prop open the file go to the end create new line and enter fw show multiuserui reboot the device go to settings and you would notice that users entry is missing as side effect the result in first section the removal of the guest icon is also covered by this solution the good part is that while guest secondary user is nowhere to be found which you can switch to using gui you can still use that multi user feature adb shell am switch user user id can switch the user easily provided that you know the user id of the guest secondary user which you can obtain from data system users on the other hand adb shell pm create user user name can create new user too all good here what if dont feel the need to have my device being used by secondary user at all dont want multi user functionality in my device that can be done thanks to android one technique remove multi user feature were not removing the feature from the system but simply restricting the system to single user as mentioned in the last section we need to edit build prop which requires root access add fw max users in build prop and restart the device this would restrict the system from creating any new user since the maximum user is set to one it would also hide the entry users from settings as well as the guest user icon aka the nuisance note that you can always switch to the guest secondary accounts using adb shell am switch user user id even after restricting the maximum users to one since the restriction is set to curb further creation of the users if you feel the need to remove those users but find it bit problematic that there is no option now to remove them from gui then simply do adb shell pm remove user user id

120441 got it to work note this requires unlocked bootloader connect the device to mac or pc in recovery mode had to map the process in my mind as the screen was broken now open terminal cmd in computer and go to platform tools type and enter adb devices to check if the device is connected in recovery mode now type adb shell mount data and adb shell mount system to mount the respective directories get the persist sys usb config file in your system using adb pull data property persist sys usb config your directory now open that file in texteditor and edit it to mtpadb and save now push the file back in the device adb push your directory persist sys usb config data property get the build prop file adb pull system build prop your directory add these lines persist service adb enable persist service debuggable persist sys usb config mtpadb push build prop back into the device adb push your dir build prop system this way you enabled usb debugging on your device but you still cant connect why because it asks for rsa verification if you could view your display then you could easily tap on yes to authorize the device am currently figuring out to bypass this want to revive my dead phone badly if you know any way to do this please share
120453 for the rsa verification that you asked to bypass dont know whether it would work in your device but it worked in my little experiment in lollipop the adb keys after authorization are saved in data misc adb adb keys your private key is saved in computer in linux the directory location is home android on windows that usually translates to userprofile android but keys might end up in windows system32 config systemprofile android in some cases source there is method described here by ashoke which might help out in bypassing the authorization however in my lollipop the method varies noticed that in my primary and secondary lollipop rom the adb keys had the same key actually all did was revoke the authorization from the secondary rom file deleted automatically disconnected device from pc copied adb keys from primary rom into secondary rom connected the device into pc and voila wasnt asked for that authorization double checked the authorization using adb devices and it was all good try the linked answer first authorize different android phone copy its keys into your device from recovery mode and see if it works

123697 the only thing you mention is the resolution stating that the cameras have the same specs only because they have the same resolution is fallacy at best its like saying that two cars should perform the same because they both have wheels when using apps like snapchat or just camera noticed that the a7000s picture quality is lesser blurry than that of the gs2 with the amount of information provided you might as well roll dice to determine what camera is better did you use the same settings did you take the same photo why is it that when different phones have same camera spec they dont capture images the same way there is more to camera than its resolution software can have an influence on the image that software may or may not be visible to you noise reduction stabilisation etc the lens additional hardware like image stabilisation
123716 you also need to take into account the pixel size of the sensor as well as the sensor size all of which can positive affect image quality of the photo the processing of the photo is vital as well
123772 because resolution is probably the least important from all the characteristics of camera and it can even go against quality larger resolution without an accordingly better sensor might just as well give worse overall quality in the usual circumstances of phones probably the most important factor is the sensor size and quality and neither will be accurately described in sales literature the physical size of the sensor has obvious influence on image quality smaller sensor will see less light and while the attached hardware and software will try to compensate this will increase noise then come the actual lens and optics this is again something you cant really describe and compare in specifications but it matters lot phones that excel in the camera department often have more complicated and more expensive lens systems coming from reputable old names of the photographic era and finally the processing of the image dont think you can find any phone camera these days that doesnt do an awful lot of processing under the hood because thats what people want to have most people are very bad photographers so it would really upset them to see what they actually shot phones compensate for almost anything these days lighting conditions movement they enhance contrast sharpness faces whatever so what it boils down to there is really no other way to compare two phone cameras but to shoot and compare for yourself if youre lucky somebody else already made the comparison and you can find the pictures on the net but always judge by the pictures not by specifications

124073 the new api for full control of the camera on android had been added to android version google added these features like iso manual focus and etc in android lollipop personally think to use this new api the camera hardware must support this features however didnt find any reference to claim this but it makes sense to me that hardware must be able to do such stuff you can use this app to check manual camera compatibility
124181 the purpose of calibration is to figure out how to compensate for how the components in your phone screws speaker magnets etc interfere with the measured magnetic field the calibration process is based on the fact that you can separate the internal and external contributions to the magnetic field by looking at how the field changes as the phone is rotated for example in one orientation the magnetic field from the magnet in the speaker will add on to the earths field but when the phone is oriented in the opposite direction the two fields will partially cancel out as you wave the phone around the magnetometer records how the magnitude of the measured field changes and uses this to calibrate the and magnetic field sensors see geometrikals answer to similar question for more details on this process note that this calibration does not let you compensate for the influence of other external objects your refrigerator on the magnetic field regarding the implementation in google maps believe that google maps has no control over the compass calibration because there is no such functionality in the android api the magnetometer is probably calibrating itself continuously and google maps is just asking you to rotate your phone so that the magnetometer can collect the data it needs to get an accurate calibration in other words you can calibrate your compass any time the magnetic field sensor is being used just by waving your phone there is no calibration mode
124604 episode return of the shell if ever had any chance of solving this first had to figure out why the shell wasnt working adbd itself was responding so it was started on the tablet side but it could not execute the shell even when hack patched it to invoke file sbin sh that myself placed in the boot image being sure that it had the proper permissions and was accessible from the shell id account that adbd uses which left only one explanation selinux cages so checked how adbd was started from my boot images init rc adbd is controlled via property triggers in init platform usb rc service adbd sbin adbd root seclabel su s0 class core socket adbd stream system system disabled seclabel adbd s0 and tried an obvious change service adbd sbin adbd class core socket adbd stream system system re packed and to my intense satisfaction saw linuxbox adb shell finally got access to the tablet from inside checking the mounted system it became clear that the flashing process even though fastboot flash system reported that all was ok had failed spectacularly it was wonder that the partition was mounted in the first place that explained why the tablet was not booting and gave me the final idea that solved the issue needed to boot the tablet so that it used my pristine copy of the system partition but at this point even though had shell access was not root the changes did in default prop are apparently ignored by the asus kernel ill have to recompile it soon so could not mount the external sdcard and dd over my good copy but did have my own boot image which meant could edit the fstab qcom inside it and do this original line that told the tablet how to mount system dev block platform msm sdcc by name system system ext4 robarrier wait my edit dev block mmcblk1p2 system ext4 rwbarrier wait and back in my linux box dd ed the pristine backup of the tablets system partition to my external sd cards 2nd partition which created via gparted to be exactly 2gb that did it the tablet booted from my external sd card edit the journey continued eventually patched and compiled my own kernel and became root

125422 it seems youve already found some kind of solution to your problem theres lot of text to read on this page but it seems this probably could have been resolved much more simply linuxbox fastboot getvar all bootloader version bootloader bootloader version hardware rev bootloader variant leopardcat 16g bootloader version baseband h00 bootloader serialno 0a3dxxxx bootloader partition type system ext4 bootloader partition size system 0x0000000080000000 among these variables did your tablet return max download size variable if so that might have provided warning outright that the flashing process might have some issues with such large image the current fastboot code is made to work around max download size that is too small but ive experienced your same error even when the image is smaller than what the device says it can handle so actually the point is kind of moot guess linux box fastboot flash system system img error cannot load system img so anyway it seems here that for whatever reason you are unable to flash if you and are right and its about size your tablet does only have gb of ram and supposedly most devices try to read the whole image into ram before flashing this is where think the mere adjustment of adding the option to fastboot might have fixed your flash as it has for me fastboot 512m flash system system img instead however it seems you tried to force your gb image into size that might not be possible for it to be stuffed into and is not the size that your devices system partition is supposed to be regarding point in my experience would not count on the brittle android build tools to complain if you ask them to do something they will fail at and its possible that they might have here regarding point dont believe you cant just do that additional steps would be required to use different system partition size assuming your tablet expects sparse image files believe the command you wanted to try instead of make ext4fs 1536m new system img system was make ext4fs 2048m new system img system the adjusted command would make an image that inflates to the correct size but is stored temporarily stripped of any excess fat like big pockets of empty data sparse image file see the page linked to earlier for more info on them dont have enough reputation on this site to repeat the link this old readme someone wrote for collection of the tools should help understand how the process goes cheers

126118 auto rotate home screen was one of the top features of 2nd android developer preview hate to burst the bubble auto rotate home screen feature was not incorporated in the final version of android marshmallow were disappointed to see that auto rotate support hasnt made it to the home screen however in the second developer preview the google app added an allow rotation option to the home screen settings which let the home screen rotate like any other app on the system we loved it it never made the jump to the final version though source however if you have got rooted phone you can modify build prop file to get this feature navigate to and open system build prop file using any root explorers add log tag launcher force rotate verbose at the end of the file optional step add lockscreen rot override true to enable screen rotation in your lock screen reboot to see the feature working source
126179 according to the supported media formats page opus is supported natively since android but only in the matroska mkv container the xiph org wiki and ietf draft state that the mime type for ogg opus files is audio ogg to test encoded flac file with opusenc and changed the extension to ogg before transferring the file to the device which made it appear and play in google play music but without metadata like tags and cover art just the filename edit just encoded few test files directly to ogg again and they play fine in google play music the basic tag fields use are detected embedded album art as well as albumart jpg files work too edit found information about draft to encapsulate flac in mp4 probably related to mozillas efforts to support flac in firefox as well as opus in mp4 never thought that this would be possible or considered to be implemented but it appears that some people in the community are working to bring opus and flac to mp4 encoding details 1khz flac source opusenc libopus from ubuntu kbps bitrate file transfer via syncthing not required thats just what use currently google play music version 2817a device nexus with cyanogenmod nightly based on android

126344 tl dr if you still want to have vibration on all notifications except for captive portal this particular issue im afraid you cant its as dbasch mentioned in the comment that the vibration actually the notification alert itself was added in marshmallow technical details when android detects that the wifi needs to login to captive portal as you already noticed it will create notification its done by setprovnotificationvisibleintent function in connectivityservice show or hide network provisioning notifications we use notifications for two purposes to notify that network requires sign in notificationtype sign in or to notify that network does not have internet access notificationtype no internet we display at most one notification per id so on particular network we can display the notification type that was most recently requested so for example if captive portal fails to reply within few seconds of connecting we might first display no internet and then when the captive portal check completes display sign in the relevant code to the notification alert that is used in android marshmallow notification notification new notification buildermcontext setdefaultsnotification default all note that notification default all will use all default values where applicable which means that it depends on your systems notification setting sound vibration and led light compared to the one in android lollipop the code is notification notification new notification no more no less thats the relevant code new notification will construct notification object with default values while it seems that theres no change in the meaning note that defaults is not set initialized to notification default all value instead since theres no initialization it will be defaulted to which is no alert whether its bug overlooked by google which has been fixed in marshmallow or not dont know also thats the reason why theres no alert in android lollipop but now there is in android marshmallow
126367 there is workaround involving do not disturbs priority only mode to put it simply you must use priority only from quick settings do not disturb since it has per app setting for notification alert that can overwrite systems default setting priority only mode will still show all notifications however only priority notifications will be alerted sound vibration and led light the idea is to treat all notifications as priority from settings sound notification app notifications app name treat as priority except for captive portal notification which is under android system app by default system apps are not listed you need to tick show system from overflow menu leave this app as non priority but dont forget for the rest of system apps however there are some disadvantages that you might consider first before using this workaround you sacrifice the intended usage of priority only mode only leave total silence as the only option however if you never intend to use this feature then youre fortunate since you can utilize it if you have many apps installed its quite tedious to set all apps to treat their notifications as priority perhaps script might help also every time you install new app you must not forget to treat its notification as priority unless you dont care about its alert you wont get any alerts for all notifications from android system you need to experiment with this since dont know what notifications are considered by android system

128055 if your phones rooted there are three ways to go around this the first one is to use adbd insecure the other one is to move it to another folder with root and then pull it from there adb shell shell android su root android mkdir sdcard data root android cp data data sdcard data root android exit shell android exit adb pull sdcard data adb shell shell android rm sdcard data shell android exit think you can build script such as echo echo mkdir sdcard data cp sdcard data exit su exit adb shell adb pull sdcard data echo rm sdcard data exit adb shell and save it somewhere finally the third option is chmod data data but this is much more unsafe so its highly discouraged
128260 rename the system ext4 win file to system ext4 tarand extract it if your twrp backup is not in compression method you will directly get to the system folder or if your twrp backup is in compression method you will get file named system ext4 which youll have to just rename it to system ext4 tar and extract it to system folder

129177 found the solution myself windows somehow does not want to install the driver as it can not verify the manufacturer so the driver from sony developers site works just fine after deactivating the windows driver signature check everything works fine to deactivate proceed like this taken from here press win then then shift once your computer has rebooted you will need to choose the troubleshoot option then head into advanced options then startup settings since we are modifying boot time configuration settings you will need to restart your computer one last time here you will be given list of startup settings that you can change the one we are looking for is disable driver signature enforcement to choose the setting you will need to press the f7 key
129296 update years later think mikes comment is right and call on google android to support way to make calendar reminder really persistent actually used the calendar snooze app for while until it stopped being reliable so im taking this comment back initially had the same reaction you did about the change in calendar behavior but just realized that calendar is simply not the right app for these kinds of reminders that you want to persist in the meantime instead of using the calendar app for those sorts of reminders you can use an app designed for reminders like google keep or google now both of which have repeating reminder features if you say ok google remind me about the dance at pm on saturday google now will set up reminder for you which you can convert to repeating reminder from the dialog box that pops up for tips on google keep see five powerful google keep features youre not using and hear that if you switch to the new inbox by gmail app your google now reminders can show up in your calendar also reasons to switch to inbox by gmail and reasons not to pcworld
129384 this question is one of the most viewed on this site yet all answers say the same getting admin rights lets you do stuff like xyz and abc the latter is not really part of relevant answer and indeed there is already question here what can rooted phone do sure rooting equals getting admin rights but lets add some more details how admin rights are implemented in android whats happens on technical level when you root phone new program applet becomes available su it sits in the system xbin folder and allows users to switch to different user id including root aka admin remember that in android applications normally run under their own user id so if su exists and an app uses it to change to root then the app can do anything the root user could do not all rooting methods produce the same change for example many methods rely on an additional app called superuser apk that has custom version of the su binary this lets the app act as permission control manager whenever su is invoked by an app in addition to su and superuser or supersu often busybox gets installed as part of the rooting script these three files technically busybox is set of files are the most common additions when we talk about rooting phone it is not trivial to just copy su to the folder yourself as the system partition is mounted read only and you need root rights to remount it as writable and youd need write permissions if it was one indirect way of doing this is using recovery with extended functionality it can mount system as writable and copy files to it in most cases this means flashing custom recovery as many stock recoveries are limited to patching only specific oem files more direct way would be to directly flash new system partition with root files using some flashing tool such tools include odinpc samsung only fastbootpc generic android flashifyapp generic android it is relatively easy to copy the system partition from your phone or an image file from the web and flash the root modified partition back lastly you may be able to get root shell using adb if the rom was compiled to allow it not common in stock roms using the root shell it is trivial to remount partitions and copy files anywhere you want if you know linux commands these simple methods work for phones that are unlocked easy to unlock when bootloader is locked the process of rooting can become convoluted process that may differ between devices see more specific rooting info here this is because any custom modifications to important partitions will break the oem signature and cause the bootloader to refuse loading bootloop or in some cases the bootloader will just undo any changes

130321 running an apk without installing it no matter if you wont accept the answer running an apk is not possible its not an executable its an archive containing the application and instructions on where all its resources should be placed so that the app can run android apk file format asking this question is the same as asking how you run an iso image or how you run zip or rar file if you really dont want to install it theres no way to run it the only alternative is to install it in sandbox environment or something like that you could try to extract the binary from the apk to the device and using shell to run it but im not to be held responsible if the results are unwanted if you told us why you want to run but not install it then might get you better answer

131548 no calibration of batteries li ion or li po used in almost all mobile devices is myth you can start using it straight away and charge as you normally did with earlier batteries this post will help you understand more looking for consistent answer about battery calibration using calibration apps doesnt really help as the battery files in system to which these apps write are renewed and previous data erased when you charge reboot as explained in this article it batterystats bin file which stores calibration information has no impact on the current battery level shown to you it has no impact on your battery life it is reset every time you unplug from power with relatively full charge thus why the battery usage ui data resets at that point explanation in italics mine from the same article related myth charging new battery for hours charging new battery for hours before use is legacy hangover from the days when nickel cadmium batteries were used those batteries had memory effect as result over period of time they remembered lesser battery capacity than rated capacity to prevent this it was advised to always fully charge these batteries this is not the case with lithium ion or lithium polymer batteries there is no logic to charge fully or hours before use just use the battery normally as suggested by others in comments table corroborates with additional information
131560 you dont need calibration app for that just fully charge the battery to in one run let it run down to below the mark the recharge it to again in one run without interception battery calibrated and as that describes normal day with recent devices take it from the charger at in the morning put it back almost depleted in the evening no calibration needed at all you calibrate it as side effect all those calibration apps do in addition is removing the batterystats bin file which doesnt do anything to calibrate the battery an old myth in fact
131853 ota files work by patching files rather than replacing them will full copy of the new version of the file this means that it has to verify that the existing files are exactly as it expects or the patching process wont work or could cause the file to become corrupt if you were to fake the fingerprint and force the ota to apply you might end up with device that cant boot due to some files being corrupt android think switched from verifying just the files it was patching to verifying the partition as whole so any modification even to file that is not being patched will cause this to fail
131858 in addition to answer posted by bmdixon oems like samsung have knox counter which gets tripped once you root or replace stock recovery by custom there were work around earlier to this but note onwards tripping knox burns this information into the hardware only way to revert knox status is by changing that chip on the motherboard am not aware how this is achieved but it is on record as mail reply from samsung expect ota to verify this first oems like huawei my current device is honor allow you to unlock boot loader and cover it by warranty allowing ota updates if rooted but stock recovery intact replacing recovery fails ota suspect carriers which lock in their customers will also employ their own means to verify before allowing ota probably this is one reason why there is varying delay in carriers rolling out ota so it may not be simple solution to have the recovery trick ota too many tricks to learn and proprietary ones which is not the purpose of twrp
132014 google changed the usb protocol for marshmallow to always default to charge the reason for this change because they brought back the ability to make external storage sd card become internal storage creating new storage type called adoptable storage originally google removed the ability to swap storages because they viewed it as huge security vulnerability adoptable storage in order to achieve your end goal it looks like you might have to compile marshmallow from source find the mtpservice java and then with updatedisabledstatelocked change mmtpdisabled to false mtpservice java

132375 thebro21s comment applies only if its knox enabled device for most android devices when you boot into downloading mode it will read few lines in system status custom or custom binary download yes and the number of time here if it hasnt be reset with triangle away if in bootloader mode it says unlock state true it might be that the rom is custom but then again it may have been done by stock flash you can also go into the settings and about and look at the system status rom kernel or base band and if it has weird name google it its probably custom rom or kernel if not it probably isnt or close enough youd never notice if you really are concerned and want fresh device on official firmware google how to flash your device with odin than download the latest stock firmware
132576 am assuming your device is not rooted by you you can factory reset your device of course after taking back up of data root your device flash custom recovery and take complete back up of your device with twrp generate md5 check sum using twrp or alternate apps like hash stamp md5 sha1 generator download stock lollipop assuming that your device variant matches with that mentioned and the rom version on your device matches generate and verify stock md5 and sha1 with twrp nandroid back up if it matches it is confirmed both are same and no tampering took place if not flash only kernel from twrp and generate md5 and sha1 repeat with downloaded image and verify repeat above with sys and data this should pinpoint the tampering that happened it is little tedious but imo worth the effort as it proves beyond doubt that either present rom has not been tampered with or if tampered in which portion of the rom it happened this may not be practical solution but is based on the premise that near fool proof validation is only possible when compared with original stock rom other variations of this could be see if ota updates work or comparing partition sizes
132709 according to https wiki cyanogenmod org clockworkmod instructions making backup clockworkmods backup restore feature will generally only back up the system data cache sd ext and dalvik cache areas other partitions such as emmc sdcard and media wont be backed up in fact the backed up system will typically be saved to the sdcard partition in the clockworkmod backup directory which depending on your device may or may not be actually located on physical removable sd card according to your question the firmware definitely yes my modifications to the firmware such as root xposed framwork installed xposed modules etc definitely yes my installed apps definitely yes app data definitely yes other data had stored on the internal sd card definitely no sdcard is not backed up because of there would be cwm backup read http forum xda developers com galaxy s3 help how to backup internal sdcard t1999853 hope it help
132712 to add to other answer your back up has all the information in your back up image as the phone has when you took back up system refers to your rom data refers to your data created by apps both that came with phone and user installed apps data data data cache the cache refers to app data stored for quick access data dalvik cache the dalvik cache refers to storage where optimisation information of your apps is stored sd ext refers to external sd card all cwms do not by default save this other partitions mentioned are not backed up compression happens if you enable it imo not worth the extra time it takes given you can always store it in external sd by choosing it or pull it to your pc
132763 systemless root developed mainly by chainfire is an alternate method to root your phone without altering files in your system it makes changes in the boot image instead of the system files like init etc and hence makes rooting and unrooting theoretically easier it is an experiment so dont think it works perfectly it also could circumvent android pay root restrictions but chainfire did not expect that and says that android pay would be patched to push out any such root users too for more information about it check the xda article the dev also has forum here
132849 main answer systemless root is rooting method procedure developed by chainfire the developer of the popular root management app supersu which involves modified boot ramdisk image the superuser su binary becomes kernel inclusion instead of existing under system xbin like in normal system based root ancillary answers preference of systemless root over traditional root it was initially suggested by chainfire to be useful for nexus devices from marshmallow onwards to prevent rooted users from having to reflash the entire stock system boot and recovery partitions before undertaking even minor ota update which has since become more important as google has introduced the policy of pushing out monthly security updates through otas and flashing the entire device every month is tedious at best systemless root eliminates the heavyweight system partition from the flashing equation allowing the devices with systemless root to be updated just after reflashing stock recovery and boot pros of systemless root over traditional root utility when ota updating devices as mentioned above the modified boot image gets rid of the tampered screen on android bootup from marshmallow onwards if the device has non stock partition most commonly recovery no exploits required systemless supersu can technically be flashed as boot image through fastboot although it is normally done by flashing zip in custom recovery which automatically patches the on device boot image to make the necessary modifications to support systemless root it works with an selinux enforcing security condition while traditional root needs selinux permissive on android and up it unintentionally circumvents android pay and android for work root restrictions which work with traditional root cons of systemless root over traditional root quite buggy and is still in beta stage although it is being actively developed and is definitely usable from personal experience edit no longer buggy and the default rooting method on android and up when using supersu some custom kernels like leankernel refuse to work with systemless root as they need traditional root for functioning properly edit most custom kernels now recommend systemless root well known such kernel being elementalx some root apps may not work with systemless root as they hard code the path to su in their code which is only applicable for traditional root not sure if this is actually con but systemless root is the only recommended rooting method that will work on android and up sources xda developers nexus 6p reddit thread not sure if its very reliable

134039 it is possible in sense however given the limitations mentioned in t0mm13b answer it makes sense that the mentioned boot loader lk is incapable of doing this so we boot custom kernel from fastboot for testing which boots enables otg functionality and once valid kernel is found on the otg device which is connected chainloads that into memory and passes control to it this could probably even be integrated into modern custom recoveries like twrp which have both otg and in some cases multirom support this has actually been used to boot ubuntu on nexus tablet using the method fastboot boot otg chainloader kernel otg chainloader kernel boots and enables otg and waits for otg device to be connected device is disconnected from pc and usb flash drive having bootable ubuntu image is connected to it via otg otg chainloader kernel detects valid linux kernel on the otg device and passes control to it after chainloading it into memory now if you wanted to you could boot compatible android rom image in similar way but remember that the otg drive would have to be kept connected to the device until you decide to return to the native os since all apps would load from and all data would be written to the usb flash drive unless the entire android rom could be configured as ramdisk ever heard of puppy linux which given the current memory capacities of common android devices and the size of the rom itself is currently impractical that precludes charging while booted to otg os too on most devices with unified data charger ports source xda developers nexus subforum

134935 as already mentioned in the comments here are the primary points you need to be careful about whenever you install an app from the play store you should pay attention to things like permissions ratings reviews by existing users etc before installing it on your device one malicious install and your phone could become compromised it doesnt matter then whether you are rooted or not when you install an app it asks you bunch of questions like what all things it needs access to like sdcard telephony resources system tools etc even without root access malicious app can do lots of damage to your phone if you permit them these resources as the existing answer suggests rooting is your only option if the malware has landed itself in the system area but if you go along that route proceed with care and caution as there is risk of bricking if incorrectly done for future reference make mental note to double check at least two things before installing an app the permissions it needs are sane and safe there are at least million installs already with at least rating you can make rare exceptions for popular apps like whatsapp skype but this is generally what you should do you may or may not be able to recover this phone but life goes on and these things will go long way to ensure that such situation will never arise
134936 try reset boot your phone into safe mode click on the tag to find out how this will only boot essential apps then uninstall any apps you think are the culprit then boot out of safe mode and see if the problem persists if it does repeat the cycle till you find the problem then by the end if the problem still persists it may be system app due to me not finding much info about your phone cant say it is full of crap ware and finding info about this phone is difficult but due to your broken screen this may be difficult and due to the extensive conversation in the comments section above doubt that your phone has root privileges but if the phones does have root privileges and the application may be in the system folder but due to my limited knowledge of what you have on phone what you have done to it etc cant be any more help then just suggesting to boot into safe mode in my opinion think it is just one of the default apps downloading use crap or the default apps have automatic updates enabled
135365 had the same problem while upgrading to cm13 from cm12 you can solve this problem without deleting your database files and therefore losing data as suggested in the other answers the culprit seems to be broken database onupgrade code in the telephonyprovider of cm the ppp number column of the carriers table does not exists but the upgrade code assumes it already exists solved it by copying the telephony db to my local linux machine and reverting the database version to version to force the upgrade code to add the missing columns the alter table statements in the linked code are guarded by try catch blocks so that it doesnt matter if some of the columns already exists boot the phone into recovery twrp to have adb root priviliges and avoid lock races with the android runtime which is constantly trying to start the telephony provider adb pull data user com android providers telephony databases telephony db adb pull data user com android providers telephony databases telephony db journal create backups cp telephony db telephony db bak cp telephony db journal telephony db journal bak then open the database with sqlite and set the version sqlite3 telephony db sqlite pragma user version sqlite quit upload the changed database back to the device and fix permissions adb push telephony db data user com android providers telephony databases adb shell cd data user com android providers telephony databases data data com android providers telephony databases rm telephony db journal data data com android providers telephony databases chown radio radio telephony db data data com android providers telephony databases chmod telephony db you could also try this on the broken system which wouldnt recommend you would probably have to become root with adb root in order to copy and modify the files with adb
135851 the most device compatible way to disable everything is to run this command at startup or set this in your build prop setprop persist sys usb config none which is equivalent to charge only on all android devices that also disables adb if you use adb regularly then setprop persist sys usb config adb will allow adb when developer options are turned on checked if you dont use adb often would not recommend it because setting adb causes my s5 to still recognize in device manager even when it is locked to restore original functionality setprop persist sys usb config mtpptpadb allows all usb protocols hope this helps anyone googling for an answer

137699 the instructions provided by tamoghna are the easiest ones to follow when it comes to doing something from gui however there exists other ways to achieve the goal you can use the system service named deviceidle to manipulate the battery optimization for an app you would need adb setup in pc once you have the latter execute adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist package replace package with package name of the app which you intend to exclude from doze mode follow view apps full package name if you do not know the package name of your app to revert changes replace with in the said command and execute it an example performed for kde connect app note that both the gui and command line method make changes in the file data system deviceidle xml if youre up to the task and have root access you can edit that file reboot the device and your app would be found under not optimized tab of battery optimization came to know about that command from this question by user2281606 was also reading optimizing for doze and app standby testing your app with doze

138313 you could use netguard see my list of internet firewalls for other alternatives which works without root and lets you block internet access for apps selectively wifi or mobile data and even always or only if screen is off its from the dev of xprivacy so it has to be good netguard source google play click images for larger variants netguard is open source so you can also find it at droid update note that recent versions of netguard include google ads as well as firebase analytics two things which imho have no business in firewall or any other security application which most likely is the reason it is no longer updated on droids official repo still available in mine with the appropriate warnings
138314 you wont be able to achieve success through the native mechanism of android cody toombs at android police has very well pointed this out in the article android will never ask users for permission to use the internet and thats probably okay in the section normal and dangerous permissions of the document permissions overview google has noted permissions are divided into several protection levels there are two protection levels that affect thrid party apps normal and dangerous permissions normal permissions cover areas where your app needs to access data or resources outside the apps sandbox but where theres very little risk to the users privacy or the operation of other apps for example permission to set the time zone is normal permission if an app declares in its manifest that it needs normal permission the system automatically grants the app that permission at install time the system does not prompt the user to grant normal permissions and users cannot revoke these permissions dangerous permissions cover areas where the app wants data or resources that involve the users private information or could potentially affect the users stored data or the operation of other apps for example the ability to read the users contacts is dangerous permission if an app declares that it needs dangerous permission the user has to explicitly grant the permission to the app emphasis mine surprising or not the following permissions comes under the list of normal permissions change network state allows applications to change network connectivity state mobile data change wifi state allows applications to change wi fi connectivity state internet allows applications to open network sockets if that doesnt suffice checkout the permissions managed by appops here if you dont find your permission listed there you wont be able to do anything with it in gui since alternative methods are already extensively covered on this site refer to block apps from accessing the internet on android device are there any tools to sandbox malware application even more than the granted permissions on android

138981 as devnul3 says power only cable is usb cable where the data pins are not connected the main reason they exist is because they can be made ever so slightly cheaper by virtue of only needing connections instead of and also because you dont need to worry about preserving the quality of the very high frequency signals on the data lines this said there are cases where power only cable is preferable to fully featured usb cable when you want to charge your device from some random usb connector somewhere as is becoming more widely known usb connector can be used for many things besides the ones the user expects so if you use normal usb cable you may end up unwittingly providing priviledged access to your device iow when youre charging from usb connector that you have no reason to trust power only cable is not only ever so slightly cheaper but its also bit safer
139348 yes this is by design you cant execute binaries from the sd card without system or superuser privileges and remounting it without the noexec option because otherwise apps could just download and execute malicious code at will in older versions of android the sd card also did not have emulated permissions so chmod would naturally fail some devices older versions of android might allow execution from data local tmp so you could try putting it there otherwise youll probably need root
139356 android just as linux prevents any user but root to change the permission bits of any file not owned by such user that said chmod is ineffective unless you have root privileges by the way even if you had such privileges you wouldnt have been able to change permissions as long as the target path is storage sdcard0 or storage emulated this depends upon security policy which is implemented in the form of the fuse filesystem and can be circumvented by moving to data media or data media emulated and chmoding the file from this position please notice that this procedure will let you execute script only if you launch it from one of the abovementioned locations lastly it should be noted that the android port of chmod does not support symbolic editing of the flags rwx and so on so youll be forced to edit them via their corresponding octal values youll also do need root privileges in order to be able to access data media trying to cd to such directory by using user privileges results in permission denied error

140248 the native aosp calendar app was replaced by googles own1 it went by the package name com android calendar but is no longer found in either google play store or on droid you can find its code on github though as for synchronization thats usually not done by the calendar app itself but by the corresponding sync service most calendar apps use the calendar provider of the android system to store their data if you want local calendar thats not synchronized at any cost and your device doesnt offer such you can use offline calendar but that app doesnt seem to be maintained anymore last version is from see google iron grip on android controlling open source by any means necessary

140486 on android marshmallow you can use the hidden system ui tuner open the quick setting panel then press and hold the settings cog wheel until it starts spinning you then get an additional settings entry in system system ui tuner status bar where you can hide the alarm
140625 tried sebastians solution but the error persisted the accepted answer results in losing all your sms therefore was not an option for me however after booting into recovery mode and deleting the files data data com android providers telephony databases telephony db data data com android providers telephony databases telephony db journal the phone worked perfectly again the files seem to contain only auto generated data so it is safe to delete them
140841 you can connect your device to your pc and use android sdk tools adb then go to the directory and in your command line use adb shell bugreport bugreport txt your bugreport will output
141323 found very insightful information on dalvik cache at stackoverflow from reputed sourcesgoogles employees who worked on dalvik virtual machine platform below is the summary of it more from android users perspective in hopefully simple words where is dalvik cache located in my android device in typical android device there is directory named dalvik cache since android is based on linux it uses file system structure of the linux kernel hence this directory is located in data folder so the path to access this dalvik cache in android device is data dalvik cache what is purpose of dalvik cache when user installs new application on android android performs some modifications and optimizations on that applications dex file the file that contains all the dalvik bytecode for the application it then caches the resulting odex optimized dex file in the data dalvik cache directory so that it doesnt have to perform the optimization process every time it loads an application what if clear dalvik cache there is no effect other than increasing the next load time of an app as it is rebuilt so an application will take more time to load as it needs to rebuild its dalvik cache hence its is ok to clear dalvik cache when installing custom roms as the system will anyway re build it with new partition on an additional note starting from android 4kitkat google introduced new android runtime called art which is going to ultimately replace the dalvik virtual machine source the art which uses the same bytecode and dex files compiles the dex file into native code that compiled code is what is now stored in dalvik cache
141340 when followed the instructions of the accepted answer with my samsung galaxy s5 the phone would always tell me that the new sd card needed checking there seems to be bug when youre trying to replace an encrypted sd card here is what did to work around it decrypt your old card before you remove it from your phone switch off the phone remove the old card insert the new card switch on your phone phone will detect the card and then complain about problems decrypt the new card this sounds like mistake but it solves the problem apparently the phone remembers that the card is supposed to be encrypted and tries to access it with the old key since the card isnt encrypted at all this will fail the card should work now encrypt the new card if you skip this last step you need to decrypt the card every time you switch on your phone
141387 yes it is possible to change the company logo if you have ever flashed custom rom which changes it and still have the update zip file lying around sometimes after extraction you will find logo bin its raw binary file file in the root directory this file contains the brand logo as well as the charging animation and the image to be displayed in fastboot mode however on your phone and most other phones there is no logo bin file but just partition named logo where complete dump of the logo bin file is saved there are update zips just for changing your phone branding however only files for the correct resolution and chipset will display correctly yes you can indeed use such files made for other phones with the same soc with the same resolution
141402 have very different take on this matter than sbrm1 note few things first and then decide whether doing this is worth it the boot logo is actually raw binary image constrained by size not format the format of the bootloader splash screen as it is known varies for even models of the same device case in point exynos and qualcomm samsung galaxy models on qualcomm devices the bootloader splash logo is typically stored on partition called splash or logo to change which you need to flash as similarly named mbn or bin file not img if you dont choose logo with format and size specific to your device it may result in unforeseen circumstances read what will appear to be hard brick the device not booting up at all why the bootloader is dumb and will try to load whatever is on the splash partition as long as it fits in there has specific size it might not even be picture at all the bootloader may choose to panic show some error message and reboot keep trying to reload the splash or continue booting the os you can hope for the last but you never know unless someone has documented the specific behaviour for your device or you learn it the hard way you may or may not lose your charging screen however do you still want to do this dont know of guide specific to your device let that put you off bit if there is indeed an acceptable splash file for your device just fastboot flash the image file note image as in disk image not photograph to whichever of the above mentioned splash partitions which exists on your device this can be done on some htc lg and nexus devices with qualcomm or tegra chipsets last fyi the manufacturer may choose to integrate the logo into the bootloader aboot know xiaomi does this for some devices redmi 1s and redmi personal experience its probably true in your case too then you will need custom bootloader with the splash screen packed into the bootloader flashable image file image as above still there cant help you beyond discouraging you so
141656 it has been at least years since this bug has been noticed and google notified it still hasnt been fixed this also shows that google employees dont use keep after must frustration ive developed system for storing numbers in keep the following are counted as part of larger number if it has digits to the left right of it point dash hash pound sign so instead of using all these digits use other punctuation example ip address amount with cents arbitrary numbers digits and longer digits is the limit account number po box once keep has marked series of digits as dial able use non digits to break the number into chunks of or less close the current keep note open the note again notice how the series of digits arent recognized as phone number anymore ill be dropping another email to google and ill be referencing this post
141887 answering your first and main question ad blocking without rooting on non rooted devices running android and higher adblock plus will filter all wifi traffic but it needs to be configured as proxy server manually detailed instructions are provided by adblock plus for not experienced users https adblockplus org android about avoid making multiple questions in one single post make single one for each single question
141895 it would be better if you split your question into three individual questions but since they are linked to each other ill answer them here for you how are recovery firmwares different from ones just called kernel or rom they refer to different things altogether recovery recovery refers to the dedicated bootable partition that has the recovery console installed combination of key presses usually power volume up or instructions from command line will boot your phone to recovery where you can find tools to help repair recover your installation install official os updates and or custom roms and other stuff recovery firmwares contain custom recovery file that enables you to do lot more additional things than what the stock recovery offers this can include options to re root your device file browser to browse through your files format individual partitions and more kernel kernel is the core of the operating system that handles requests to and from the hardware memory and process management and all the low level stuff that is necessary for android to be able to run it is based on the linux kernel with few modifications to suit it to android versions kernel firmwares contain kernel that when installed replaces the existing kernel and modifies the low level stuff in order to tweak the software to make better use of the hardware better battery life higher performance increased signal reception etc are some things custom kernel can do rom custom rom replaces your devices android operating system normally stored in read only memory with new or modified version of the android operating system popular custom rom is cyanogenmod which gives you host of new options as compared to the original firmware roms may contain different android system altogether or might also include kernel and or recovery its best to read the op on those threads to find out what it contains in what way does each of those roms differ from the cyanogenmod which ive happily used in the past but for which there is no s7 edge version released from what can see incidentally used odin to install cyanogenmod on my old phones rather than recovery this is subjective to the rom you are referring to some roms use the rro layers engine for theming while others use the cyanogenmod theme engine some roms might have additional features over those present in cyanogenmod others might have different user interface altogether as to the unavailability of an s7 edge version of cyanogenmod this is because official builds arent made yet or are in the works are there major differences in how the s7 edge will operate with such rooted firmware rom as compared to the stock one specifically will it be any more vulnerable to exploits etc given that no one can really tell whether these roms have built in trojans again these are subjective to the rom you choose basically some offer better performance others offer better battery life and few more offer mix of the two it depends on which rom you choose there are few roms that might be more vulnerable to exploits than others therefore it is recommended to go for an official build of popular custom rom as they are tested and checked so that they would not contain malware given all these concerns about android rooting is there any way that ad blocking can be performed without rooting as xangua said adblock plus will filter wifi traffic but needs proxy server configuration if not what is the least intrusive and least risky way to root an android in this case an s7 edge rooting is device specific there are different ways to achieve root access on different devices in the case of an s7 edge you could try kingo root it has been claimed to work on an s7 edge however be careful one wrong step can brick your device
141924 have no idea why anybody has not mentioned lucky patcher yet lucky patcher is an application that can modify applications apk files present on the phone by patching them one of the things it can do for example is remove ads its ad removing mechanism is very powerful and can not only make ads not load but also remove shrink the ad boxes so you wouldnt even think they were there it needs root if you want to patch applications without reinstalling them but it can also patch applications without root by uninstalling them patching them and then installing them again it can do many other things too some which are illicit and highly discourage you from doing them the applications interface can be overwhelming and takes some getting use to but once you get the hang of it you will find its power beats almost every other adblocker for android out there how to patch an application to remove ads open lucky patcher and tap on the application you wish to block the ads in tap on open menu of patches tap on create modified apk file tap on apk without google ads customize the ad removal settings if you want tap on rebuild the app wait until the patching process is complete and tap go to file tap on the first item that is in the list that appears tap uninstall and install and follow androids uninstall and install dialogs open the app and confirm that the ads have been removed lucky patcher can be downloaded here
142608 to add to jareds answer cant comment not enough reputation yet this works with the emulator only so wrote an app you can run on real device and it provides exactly the same interface telnet to and run geo fix or geo nmea mockgeofix
143373 this lockscreen replacement is caused by an ad from du quick charge am pretty sure that this lockscreen was added to the app es app locker many user revievs are stating that this app comes with lots of unwanted ads and lockscreen replacements see this review this is what they are answering to most people so you either have the option to turn this settings off apparently or remove this application you can check the user reviews here google play story disabling du quick charge may not work on devices in this case insure that you completely remove the application if the quick charge screen continues to display check to see if you have any other apps that have this adware and remove them edit based on the information seen in another question wanted to update this answer it seems like quite handful of applications have added this lockscreen replacement in their latest updates there is one reddit discussion which mentions few apps es app locker and es file explorer pro xender touchpal amber weather go weather forecast widgets infact most apps related to go camera kitty play locx peel remote as andrew pointed out the main cause of this lockscreen replacement is the advertisement of du quick charge developed by du apps studio if you are experiencing similar problems then check this helpful answer by firelord to check which app might cause this ill try to update this answer from time to time
143491 apparently there is an android specific firefox browser plug in called tabs backup this seem to work like charm it places text file in storage emulated android tabs backup aka sdcard android tabs backup called backup ddmmyyy hhmmss txt however it would still be interesting to know how to do this from command line update since some time back tabs backup no longer works for the recent versions of android firefox instead use tabs export you also need separate plugin to import tabs
143498 note this solution requires rooted android in terminal emulator app execute requires busybox if running android or below for marshmallow remove the term busybox from the following command su content query uri content org mozilla firefox db tabs tabs projection url busybox cut sdcard firefox tabs txt where content query to query content provider org mozilla firefox db tabs content provider from firefox projection url list data from url column only click image to enlarge if youve sqlite3 tool in android then you can do su sqlite3 data data org mozilla firefox files mozilla default browser db select url from tabs sdcard firefox tabs txt ive assumed that youve single firefox profile and its name has not been altered if youve multi profile setup or if you did change the profiles name then instead of default provide the correct name of the profile of whose tabs you want in your list
143579 this is to provide additional evidence that es explorer is another culprit from the family of es apps network monitoring how to get started and why you should consider it post which appeared on xda portal yesterday confirms this using fiddler the free web debugging proxy for any browser system or platform the xda post explains set up of fiddler creating proxy connecting your phone and laptop on the same wifi network and analysing traffic in particular it analysed traffic from es explorer and says even though the pro version does not come with ads several mbs worth are still being downloaded just not shown the app is built poorly with no regard for efficiency the app is communicating with baidu constantly post ends with pictorial evidence of other malware assosciated with es explorer
143686 per this page warning do not boot into samsungs rom without first applying our root zip samsungs ota updates install system etc install recovery sh and system recovery from boot which cause samsungs rom to replace the recovery image you had just flashed with the stock recovery our root zip removes these files thus preserving your custom recovery follow the directions below to boot directly into cwm recovery which is good information because its telling you exactly what happening however you can get around this without downloading their questionable files after you install the twrp recovery with odin the device will reboot after it vibrates in the rebooting process pull the battery have it ready to pull it boots fast pop the battery back back in and hold your recovery sequence vol up home power this will get you into the twrp and you can now sideload or if that fails adb push file data the files you want to install
143691 before you flash the recovery untick the auto reboot option in odin then flash the recovery after flashing in done reboot your device directly to recovery mode from download mode by pressing vol up power home button together now you will see the twrp recovery is booted in your device now you can reboot normally and your twrp will be installed
143789 add to the above answer from what found while testing both oses phoenix os is now x86 only platform while remix is x86 arm phoenix os supports window transparency file manager in phoenix os makes more sense in use settings panel of phoenix os is more well organised phoenix os still lacks of ethernet support major drawback phoenix os doesnt support 2nd screen output on laptops while remix can mirror and allows the main screen to be turned off via laptops function key applications running in full screen most 3d games work properly in remix os while those running on phoenix os tend to leave space at the bottom what likely the size of hidden status bar title bar and miscalculate the mouse position in axis title bar height above the actual picture on screen my personal verdict so far if you just need the desktop oriented android and play games less choose phoenix os if you care more for android 3d games choose remix os
143914 there is solution for unrooted devices know this is late answer but as all existing answers suggest that usb reverse tethering is only possible if either your device is rooted or has system support for reverse tethering though itd be worth pointing out theres one more option few months ago was looking for solution that would allow me to use my laptops internet connection on an unrooted android device but just couldnt find solution eventually started to develop my own solution the result is an app that works on devices running android or higher on client side and all major desktop oss on the host side the app is available on google play reversetethering noroot
144430 it seems es file explorer does this now have had it installed for years but today saw du quick charge pop up and it seems to be tied with an update of es file explorer uninstalled it and the malware is gone
144447 for people like me who hate es explorer doing this but cant move away from it right nowbecause of its loads of features we can disable this unnecessary feature go to es explorer tools and disable charging boost this will remove the annoying ad screen you see when you plugin the charging cable
144816 in my case needed cross platform solution since use linux heres what worked for me back everything up this will wipe everything on the phone including the internal sd card download pit file you want to flash used this one which resizes system from mb to gb and data from gb to gb any compatible recovery used this one optional rom you want to install installed cyanogenmod nightly download and install heimdall ubuntu sudo apt install heimdall flash others https bitbucket org benjamin dobell heimdall downloads boot to download mode unplug the usb cable power off press and hold the volume down home and power buttons you can let go once you see the warning screen press the volume up button to continue past the warning screen connect the usb cable to your phone and pc optional back up the existing pit sudo heimdall download pit output i9100 stock pit no reboot flash the new pit and recovery sudo heimdall flash repartition pit i91001gb 6gb pit kernel cwmr6047 img no reboot boot to recovery unplug the usb cable power off press and hold the volume up home and power buttons you can let go once you see the i9100 screen format all partitions including system data cache and the internal sd card sdcard0 when formatting the internal sd card if it asks you what filesystem to use pick fat vfat or exfat if you pick ext4 you will have problems sources for all other partitions pick ext4 if asked install the rom or restore your backup
145277 play store will count installation or not definitely wont be count an installation if play store will not count then what is the meaning to use it from developer side what will be benefit to the developer the key behind android instant apps is that devs won have to go back and create separate version of their app to make this work all that required is simple update to their current application about day worth of work in all says ficus kirkpatrick engineering director for instant apps google to make sure majority of android users get access to the instant apps feature has made it compatible with android jelly bean os and later versions this way the android instant apps will reach over billion users
145281 quoting from xda emphasis supplied android instant apps is an evolution to the way android has done applications traditionally rather than downloading full blown application instant apps allows users to stream apps to try it out in reality it partial code download without going through the hassle of downloading and installing it so if it is partial download for users to try it out it logically wont count as installation if play store will not count then what is the meaning to use it from developer side what will be benefit to the developer this allows app developers to reach out to an even wider audience as they can now project native android app experience to the end user with something as simple as url click and you re in the app what makes instant apps good for the developer outside of the increase in app range is that they don need to build whole different app devs do need to update their existing android apps in order to get the advantage of the instant apps functionality android instant apps extends all the way back to android jellybean so you aren restricted to only handful of users on the latest android version from developer perspective suppose that firebase analytics also announced yesterday will be integrated with this other features of firebase analytics instead of focusing on page views impressions or sessions developers can see what users are doing inside the app how paid advertising campaigns are performing with cross network attribution and where users are coming from defining audiences better crash reporting notifications and dynamic links to to help developers grow and re engage app user bases storage google cloud to device push messaging service google cloud messaging gcm is being integrated into firebase backend and has been renamed as firebase cloud messaging fcm monetization admob has been integrated into firebase

145395 facebook started forcing this change couple of months ago theres nothing anyone can do about it find it rather annoying myself which is why switched to facebook wrapper app like swipe it has workaround for this behavior suggest you do the same
146300 im not dev so just can give raw explanation apps declare in their manifest which mimetypes they understand and willing to respond to on share actions for this they define so called intent filters intent filter action android name android intent action send category android name android intent category default data android mimetype application data android mimetype audio data android mimetype image data android mimetype message data android mimetype multipart data android mimetype text data android mimetype video intent filter so whenever you hit the share button the content to share is evaluated and matched against apps having declared their willingness to receive the format sources intent filter to capture all sharing intents stackoverflow receiving simple data from other apps developer android com
146305 there are two parts to this the mechanism for the communication apps to say they can share things and the mechanism for the apps with content to share ill deal with them one at time but first quick note about intents intents the intent in android is whats used to start an app it can work like shortcut or like windows file association the intent can specify the name of the app to start but it doesnt have to it can also specify the action to perform open your main activity view this url create calendar entry and the mime type of the object it will act on that the thing you want to view has type image jpeg some names of actions are specific to particular app but many are standardised by android to allow apps to interact intent filters and communication app each app specifies intent filters to say what kind of actions it can perform an image viewer app would register an intent filter for view this url where the mime type is image web browser would register an intent filter for view this url where the url scheme is http or https to be able to share things an app registers an intent filter for the send intent either with specific type if it can only share photos or for any type content app the app that wants to share some content creates an intent with the share action and url pointing to the content to share this is often temporary url that gives the receiving app temporary access to the file in the content apps private storage or to stream generated by the content app it doesnt specify the name of an app to handle the intent then it gives that intent to the android framework and asks android to display the chooser dialog android compares the intent with the intent filters from all installed apps and creates the list and shows it to the user when the user picks particular app android starts that app and passes it the intent the app uses the url to get the content from the original app new in marshmallow direct share in marshmallow theres another mechanism called direct share this supplements the intent mechanism so that you can choose people or groups to share to directly from the chooser dialog skipping the extra step of who would you like to send it to this works slightly different the communication app has to provide service when the app with the content asks for chooser android starts the service for each relevant app the service returns list of relevant share targets and android assembles all those separate lists into the list that gets shown in the dialog
146403 old question posting to add alternative using google now on tap on marshmallow which does away with failed attempts in getting the right combo of keys correctly pressed at times ended up rebooting this has the advantage of better organising screenshots or sharing directly with contacts using direct share which pops up when you wish to share press and hold the home button until google now on tap appears tap the share button in the bottom left hand corner images above from here on moto play power vol dn works
147842 you can use fdisk via busybox on droid so assuming you have the busybox binary on your rom and its on your path the command would simply be busybox fdisk the various fdisk options example busybox fdisk dev block sda

147891 few years back worked on android boot time optimization as android developer obviously as part of this work we first needed to analyse where android spends time during booting below is the brief findings hardware used omap3430 board which is like development board on which stock android is flashed on actual commercial production device there will be additional specific hardware to visualize the boot time we used developer tool called bootchart the most time spend by android is in following areas zygote process when android os is started it will start zygote process it preloads classes to create shared memory area for applications this work of proloading of java classes takes secs for its completion why because the zygote class preloading is essential for good performance of the system after boot so once classes are loaded of all apps then run time of app is much faster package manager service in logcat output we can see that package manager scans directories system app system framework data app data app private next there is component called activity manager which start differents services such as location service telephony service etc and it takes nearly sec to finish this why because the package scan can in theory do some caching of its results after first boot and may check for security vulnerabilities if you add up these times it is about seconds you may ignore these numbers in todays day and age but the point these number indicate is where android aosp code spends time during boot oems have their own set of hardware which varies device to device of course there are other hardware and software initializations that android needs to do after these time consuming steps which can stretch boot time further and is there anything as user can do to speed up the booting process not much guess the android developer community and oems are still working on expediting the boot time but as you may imagine it is not all that easy and making changes to optimize boot time may end up causing more app load time during normal operations as hinted by android framework engineer

147915 android boot is slow my phone has quad core gig of ram android both kitkat and lollipop takes some seconds to boot to completion my phone is only dual core with 1g ram zenfone and never have that problem cold boot in seconds reboot in ish cyannogenmod some users report less than seconds booting time using ubuntu with systemd and some seconds it depends on the config and what you considered boot time my laptop i5 1st gen gb ram with spinning disk is considered usable finished booting after about seconds sure can delay disable some of the services to get faster boot time and start them manually as needed but in my point of view based on my preference that wont count as usable on pc vs mobile theres some differences you should consider when comparing between pc and mobile linux from cpu down to the kernel most notable differences due to the nature of the device mobile cpu mostly designed with power conservation as main consideration this greatly affect performance android kernel have some mobile specific features which may affect boot time and hardware access furthermore android kernel known to have compatibility problems with mainline stable this is mostly due to vendors preference to stick with old kernel version that compatible with their device drivers aosp marshmallow runs while stable kernel is currently at so what makes android boot so slow why dont we check if you have access to adb and already enable developer options check the boot log using adb logcat events threadtime grep boot on my device this is the output bambang pamungkas adb logcat events threadtime grep boot boot progress start boot progress preload start boot progress preload end boot progress system run boot progress pms start boot progress pms system scan start boot progress pms data scan start boot progress pms scan end boot progress pms ready boot progress ams ready boot progress enable screen as you can see total boot time from vm start until initial screen drawing by window manager is seconds additional time on firmware kernel space on your linked asnwer this translate to step isnt included notice that it takes secs to process the entire systems apk boot progress pms this translate to of boot time which includes cleaning inexistent system packages and incomplete installation of packages validating installed apps setting library path etc see complete source code of packagemanagerservice so generally the total boot time is dependent with the number of packages app installed on the device more app means longer wait during pms process additionally starting activities takes sec of boot time the rest is neither significant nor safely modifiable without deep knowlegde of system behaviors is there anything can do to speed up the booting process try other rom sony is one of the good guys who provide healthy environment for tweakers recommend aosp or cyanogen just be aware of the limitations test dont assume its easy to make assumption that boot slow is faster simple logcat command like above would reveal some useful infos for basic boot time benchmarking between roms if you know what youre doing embedded linux wiki have list of possible tweaks to improve boot time on improving boot time on your comment art was designed to make running apps faster whos working on one to make booting faster out of the box in my opinion tweaking boot time is both unnecesarry and provide insignificant gain since your phone will theoretically stay up most of the time its far more important to maintain the system stability with the tradeoff of longer boot process to ensure higher uptime and less error
147932 another possibility is using adb adb shell settings put global heads up notifications enabled source
148288 originally android was written for bit processors only and specifically bit arm processors later intel and mips invested lot into making android support their architectures too but still only bit processors they were able to do this without many compatibility problems because most apps arent shipped as binaries written in java they are instead shipped as bytecode which virtual machine on the phone compiles to the phones architecture when the app is run some apps include native components which are shipped as binary this is done to make some kinds of apps faster particularly games or to let the app access libraries that arent available in java those apps can include more than one binary for the native code parts to allow them to run on different architectures even so the majority of apps are java only so they just work on any architecture the above was all true at the time this question and most of the other answers was written but no longer lollipop introduced support for the new bit arm processors armv8 as well as for intel and amds x86 processors which means that android now supports both bit and bit processors the nexus was the first flagship bit android device as well as giving access to new instruction set extensions bit support means that apps can use more than gb of ram most apps wont need that much but high end games and photo video creation software can certainly make use of it pushing android towards being platform for console quality games including vr games and for creating content java apps dont need to be updated to take advantage of this because the virtual machine always compiles them to the phones architecture but apps with native code will because armv8 is backwards compatible with bit code the same way x86 can still run x86 code even apps which include native code for bit processors can still run on bit android so an app only needs to be compiled for bit if it contains native code and it wants to take advantage of the higher ram limit or the new features of the architecture

149538 using fairphone and fairphone open os and following this guide to living without google set up location services using location middleware provider unifiednlp no gapps it is easy to do this using the droid repository install unifiednlp no gapps install geolocation backends such as localgsmnlpbackend install geocoding backend nominatimenlp reboot your phone start the unifiednlp app and set up the backends in localgsmnlpbackend select create database and let it generate database from opencellid or mozilla location services this takes ages and downloads huge amounts of data so make sure you are on wifi enable location options in settings result both gps and network based location services work with little or no privacy impact
149718 for me cm it is still confusing you have to go under settings data usage and then make sure that both data connection and set mobile data limit toggles are on below them there is range of dates dropdown which you can choose to see data usage of previous months click on it and you will get list of previous periods now you have to scroll all the way down through all periods mine seems to go back all the way down to january below the last one there will be change cycle option click it and it will allow to change starting date
150212 it is not drm protected source is music bought on google music drm protected where the first post in reply talks of user deploying purchased app to dropbox for unlimited use and does it matter where buy my music shows music purchased from any app store can be played on any other platform or device which is only possible if there is no drm
151565 the song is yours simply install music manager for google play music on your computer to download your songs think its also possible from the website just havent tried that
152090 to my knowledge its the approach root based firewalls use ipfilter iptables to control the flow this automatically applies to all apps whether theres network connection available at all or not whether the routing is working completely or not at all or whether youre in closed environment intranet without access to the outer world internet apps youve got blocked are blocked on pretty low level non root firewalls do not have access to that low level so they must use work arounds in most cases this is done using androids vpn facilities depending on implementation this either works completely on device again regardless of what network connection might be available or via external services connecting you to the app providers vpn in the latter case things break as soon as that service stops being available fact you might notice or not in either case im not sure if really all apps honor the vpn or if there are ways around another nasty fact with vpns ive read about is the annoying permanent notification coming along saying your network might be monitored but afaik that should only turn up if the app in question needs its own certificate installed verdict id personally trust root based solution more but where rooting is not an option non root solutions should be almost as good in that case my recommendation would go towards open source solutions like netguard its developer also made xprivacy and is well trusted speaking of which for further details take look at the xda introduction of netguard which explains the background with some more details im not familiar with the technical details behind androids vpn implementation but quoting whitewinterwolf see below comment its up to android base system to enforce this there is no reason to think this is not done properly again quoting whitewinterwolf the vpn api used by netguard allows all data to be intercepted by an unprivileged application this is what android effectively consider as monitoring it has no relation with any certificate and this warning is an unavoidable and expected consequence of using this api
152172 actually the latest version of youtube app tested on v11 has fast forward and rewind features but unfortunately its not active by default as hinted by the string resources string name accessibility rewind rewind string string name accessibility fast forward fast forward string the features only work on accessibility mode try enabling switch access or talkback but its lot noisier from accessibility on androids settings the next time you use youtube app fast forward and rewind buttons are shown beside the play button on the center
152174 as the author of netguard have first hand experience in this field disadvantage of firewall based on local vpn is that not all traffic types can be handled because the android linux kernel does not allow forwarding all traffic types over socket based connection an example is ipsec which is being used for ip calling by some manufacturers partial not for ipsec solution to this would be to use remote vpn server to forward traffic but this is privacy wise not acceptable for lot of people and would come with additional complexity and probably also with extra battery usage in practice handling tcp and udp traffic appears to be sufficient for of the netguard users since android it is possible to exclude applications from being routed into the vpn the vpn implementing application decides if this is mandatory or optional which can be used to address problems arising from not being able to forward all traffic another option is to exclude address ranges which netguard uses to fix ip calling for some manufacturers another disadvantage is that forwarding traffic will increase battery usage on mobile devices because it involves some processing because packets needs to be inspected and to be forwarded using iptables which is integrated in the linux kernel is more efficient as thus more battery friendly in general it has appeared that android routes all traffic into the vpn even traffic of system applications and components but manufacturer could decide to exclude certain traffic types reducing the security that can be achieved by vpn based firewall netguard does not analyze the data itself except for dns requests to provide ad blocking but if it would it could raise privacy concern nevertheless technically seen this is an advantage of vpn based firewall if you still want to call it that way because it would allow state full inspection of data streams beyond what is possible with iptables this would likely be at the costs of battery usage because of the processing involved note that it would require local mit attack to inspect ssl streams yet another disadvantage is that android doesnt allow chaining of vpns so using local vpn to implement firewall will prevent using of real vpn service unless the firewall provides such service itself or alternatively forwarding or proxy mechanism to another vpn application lastly vpn based firewall depends on the application providing the firewall vpn service to be running this seems to be trivial but it is not because some manufacturer android versions variants are too aggressively killing processes in low memory conditions imho it is bug if android kills applications providing vpn service finally rooting of android devices is becoming increasingly difficult leaving vpn based firewall as the only choice for many people dont expect google to add system based firewall anytime soon because it could affect their ad revenue significantly ios does have system based firewall let me know if there are any questions and will try to answer them

153930 like it is said already the chat is not touched by all these backups you can delete them without any harm the thing is it wont help you nothing to delete these whatsapp will rebuild them day after day till they all are back you cannot change this backup behaviour of whatsapp the only thing to get the backups smaller is to delete your chats and delete the whatsapp data then not restore the existing backup when whatsapp started first time after data deletion but who wants this edit wrote little task in tasker need root for it which deletes all these old backups each night this saves me some mb of space use the action run shell with rm command with wildcard works

154380 figured out that the only way to get around not being able to drag and change your route on the google maps app for android is to add multiple destinations this is how you do it according to google support with my corrections added in add multiple destinations open the google maps app maps search for your destination or tap it on the map in the bottom right tap the blue circle itll show car bus bike taxi or person walking start the navigation in the bottom right tap the little icon with the three dots in column and search along route then search for more places the search bar will appear at the top and you will have to type in the intersection where you want to stop or detour to you can also add specific place like restaurant for example touch the location on the map when it pops up and then add stop at the bottom right now it will alter your route to include that stop along the way presto notes you can edit are supposed to be able to add up to stops but havent figured this out yet because it wont let me add any more than one stop directions to multiple destinations or waypoints aren available for public transit or rides to change the order of your stops find the destination you want to move and then touch and hold reorder and then drag the destination you can search for places along your route hope this helps happy mapping
155663 not now but if you plan to use it for year then you need to give it bit more consideration historically android os updates does not increase ram usage by much as far as my observation goes as of now free ram at boot time stands at 3gb for 720p device with 2gb ram lightweight rom and no google apps the problem is with third party apps as their functions grow they tend to use much more ram than at the time of release for example wechat typically takes 200mb right now even if you use few they will increase usage over time and eat up what remains little by little rewind to moto was really decent midranger at that time and 1gb is just enough back then but multitasking proves to be burden for it now with only 500mb remaining at boot and each app taking their share with no more than third party apps the auto killing mechanism will kick in eliminating background apps giving bad experience add miui notorious ram hog to the mix and you have my opinion
155665 key aspect here light user who doesnt play games doesnt watch movies doesnt use many apps uses only for day to day to use if the usage pattern continues to be same for next few years answer is no it doesnt make difference while the other answer has pointed out valid instances of certain apps occupying more ram as as time rolls imo it is not very pertinent given that you are not multi tasking but if you are using ram hoggers like facebook which nearly takes up gb of ram it may result in sluggish performance if another hungry app is opened up how much ram does phone need gives an interesting take on current trend of high ram phones and also mentions that google official minimum spec for bit phone that pretty much every phone these days is mb ram so you are left with one gb of ram for apps even if android os is updated to bit and you retain your gb ram device pretty much future proof edit your chosen device os is bit and occupies mb of ram and if it is bit it would require mb of ram as per table it is dependent on screen size and pixel density large in your case and pixel density is less than dpi this size is only for the os radio modem is extra which is not much anyway source page of android compatibility definition bottom line for your use it shouldnt matter since emui occupies gb and you are still left with gb which is plenty even if emui is upgraded doubt it would make substantial difference

159860 im bit surprised by the other complicated answers maybe ive misunderstood the question so feel free to comment and vote accordingly by definition full backup including rom apps and data is called nandroid backup therefore the question is asking how do do nandroid backup on my unrooted device you do not need rooted device to be able to do nandroid backup nandroid backups are usually done through custom recovery like twrp or clockwordmod which do not always need rooted device to install for example using adb twrp can be installed as per the directions here it may be possible to temporarily load custom recovery thus preserving the stock recovery and your warranty for twrp this can be done replacing fastboot flash recovery twrp img with fastboot boot twrp img in step of the linked tutorial some devices require the bootloader to be unlocked to install custom recovery others do not note that unlocking the bootloader usually factory resets your device

162027 it is very important to answer this question correctly as many people rely on this backup until when you actually need it you realize that it is not exactly what you think it is which is disastrous let me answer this question very clearly for everyone twrp backup does include apps and their data but skips media files such as your pictures videos and music took full twrp backup before sent my phone to service when it was back restored the backup my phone started like it was before soon after realized that my photos and music was completely gone looked everywhere in my phone but there was nothing left from my pictures luckily for some reason had hunch about it and copied my photos separately and music can be restored easily although remembered that after weeks that made separate copy of my photos it really hurts it backs up data partition but for some reason skips the data media folder another discussion on xda most importantly the github discussion
162256 further to the answer by eldarerathis you can disable an app for specific user used this method to remove some apps from restricted user that werent listed on the user settings screen all commands from an adb shell root access is required to make changes firstly get the users id pm list users users userinfo alice running userinfo bob running then pm disable user com cyanogenmod filemanager package com cyanogenmod filemanager new state disabled user to re enable pm enable user com cyanogenmod filemanager in this example alice can use the file manager but bob cant you can do similar thing with hide instead of disable am not sure which is best but see this answer the converse of hide is unhide reboot may be needed to effect unhide you can list packages with pm list pacakges user give to list enabled packages or if you want to see disabled ones there would appear to be no filter for hidden packages fwiw tried the above on lollipop with cm on an amazon fire kffowi

165606 yes device administrator only has permissions to do what it says if you change the permissions of the app that the administrator is associated with the administrators permissions will not change answer made from the following sources
165663 as you explicitly pinged me for an answer afaik apps can only use permissions declared in their manifest so there should be no way an app could add itself permissions it never requested there deviceadmin gives high extra powers apps are protected against uninstall and can access some extra stuff they couldnt do without what exactly this includes im not sure only can refer to specific part of the page youve linked where the powers are explained cannot vouch for the pages completeness or correctness at that wouldnt be the first time some error made it in there enabling device administrator source android developers click image to enlarge you might remember theres something else carrying similar name adm the android device manager checking above screenshot with that in mind gives you an idea on the basics adm allows you to permit those functions though afaik it doesnt feature monitor screen unlock attempts and disable cameras but this is typical example of using most of those features tl dr afaik deviceadmin cannot grant permissions to any app including the da app itself especially not if the app in question did not declare them in its manifest it just gives the app carrying this permission access to specific system features not available otherwise

168092 the some apps may not function correctly warning is standard thing that pops up when you disable stock apps you shouldnt experience any issues for the most part the only instance where could possibly see an issue is when using googles other email client inbox but even then its its own standalone app and they use google play services to connect with google and its services so as long as youre not using any apps that for some reason directly link to gmail there shouldnt be any as long as youre not using some weird xposed module or something in some way youll be fine
168107 it is standard message to warn that dependent applications will find some functionality missing few apps are dependent on gmail most other email apps would work fine in its place the only deficiency that noted was that the gmail app can accept html content sent shared from other apps other email app turn the html content to plain text

169608 by looking at the inf file you can find that it tells to use the winusb driver so there is better solution than disabling driver signature enforcement you can use the tool zadig http zadig akeo ie this tools create self signed inf for this specific device using ephemeral keys added to the trusted certificate store for this only device inf removing the need to disable signature check so you can do this download the tool start it select the s1boot fastboot device select the winusb driver click install and then fastboot devices list your device

172293 if the apps are installed silently without the usual installation dialog presumably these apps directly call pm packagemanager which as system app bears the permission android permission install packages the phone has to be rooted so the app could call pm in root context else you will be greeted with the message neither user xxxx nor current process has android permission install packages edit as izzy pointed out in the comment android permission install packages is also granted to apps installed to system see below comment and this so question for more insight

174464 the status connected no internet in androids wifi settings strictly means that you have connection to the wireless access point and valid ip configuration so connectivity to the local network is possible your device has not yet established connection to googles connectivity check and thus determined that no internet connectivity available this does not mean that you dont have an internet connection it just cant reach the google servers google com generate to determine this this often appears shortly after connecting to wifi access point when the device is still checking the connectivity this can also appear if the network you are connected to is using captive portal and you havent authenticated with it yet it is also possible that there isnt any internet connectivity on the wifi ap for instance when connecting to drone or digital camera
174466 connected generally means the devices in question have successfully established communication between each other in other words they are able to sent data packets between each other connected no internet means communication is established between the devices but this communication is not established with other interconnection of outside servers internet or outside world in this way data packets are still sent and received between devices and not outside server one of the devices router mobile mobile apns provide this gateway in order to allow sending and receiving of these packets to outside servers several factors prevent this connection to the outside servers firewall in one of the devices firewall by isp blockage of the domain name system which translates host names to ip addresses invalid apns incorrect dns settings etc
174607 most of the solutions known to me require root as noted in comments however there is third party application that seems to be able to handle this task as well hotspot manager claims to be able to monitor all connected clients on the hotspot it gives the mac address as well as ip address of connected clients some other features include managing multiple wifi hotspots for different scenarios monitoring all connected clients to your device wifi auto recovery wifi state will be recovered if the hotspot is turned off assuming either widget or the app to toggle see screenshots
174728 another uglier workaround involves using terminal but it has an advantage if you already have terminal installed in your device simply type ip neigh in terminal and you should see an output showing connected devices ip addresses as well as mac address but it looks bit cluttered though see screenshot screenshot click image for larger variant the information in the terminal output includes ip address of connected client mac address obscured in screenshot interface wlan0 state of connection stale reachable etc note this does not need root permissions
175996 drivers are not distributed as standalone package in order to increase market penetration of the hisuite software its quite popular marketing strategy you can get what you want only in bundle with something you dont actually want but need to get the primary item is big enough to make you buckle in and get the whole package nevertheless you can circumvent the bundling yourself download the hisuite installer open the installer exe with 7zip and extract its content preserving internal folder structure trick that works on most installers find something that looks like the driver run install it preferably on disposable system first to prove its what you want in hisuite version it was outdir driver all driversetup exe works with p8 lite and mate
176097 cpu is versatile app that gives you soc information apart from some other apps from app description on play store

176503 as youve already noted the big little combination strategy technically hmp heterogeneous multi processing clusters is the primary reason for so many and sometimes overwhelmingly many cores mobile device often runs into multiple scenarios both heavy load and light load ones included an extreme consumer class example is mediateks helio x20 which has performance oriented a72 cores balanced a53 cores plus energy efficient a35 cores thats very flexible throughout different usage cases however think cores clusters is usually enough theres also another desktop like example qualcomms snapdragon series and there are only cores of the same microarchitecture in each soc with clocked higher and clocked lower qualcomm made these socs because they were very confident of their own microarchitecture krait and krait for games even if they seemingly demand gpu performance rather than cpu they still put heavy load on the cpu gpu cannot work alone without something else supplying it with data to be processed and thats one of the major jobs that the cpu is doing while youre gaming in most gaming cases the gpu only renders graphics while all other jobs like loading data resources and assets and calculating in game mechanics like the system environment and physics are done by the cpu you wont observe higher frame rate if you upgrade your gpu while sticking to low end cpu secondary reason is how android utilizes cpu resources android pretty much makes their own application environment it uses nothing but codes and apis from java but it has its own virtual machine named dalvik which was later replaced by art api level apks have their executable codes in neutral format much like class files in java before theyre run the codes get compiled once more into the machines native instructions the compilation process is multi threaded and can utilize multi cores for performance boost and when an app is running there are several other processes and mechanics like the garbage collector that run alongside or parallel to the app more cores can let the supportive processes run more efficiently as well as the main app if you use file type identifier youll find that optimized dex files are in elf format while the neutral dex files are just in format of their own another lesser reason is that arm cores cant work as fast as an intel x86 chip the intel x86 microarchitecture can be dated back to when the intel chip started to be designed which means that the x86 has developed over long time single modern high end arm cortex a73 core is only as powerful as an intel clarkdale core taking core i5 as an example geekbench single core this is because x86 is cisc microarchitecture while arm is risc microarchitecture you surely dont want phone that becomes laggy with only two or so active apps more cores will help relieve the pressure thats why dual core socs are relatively popular only on smart watches who needs performance on smart watch interestingly more cores will result in less power than single core at the same load the relationship between cpu frequency and power consumption is more than linear so twice the frequency will always result in demanding more than twice or even 3x or 4x as much power while delivering less than twice the performance due to other resource limitations like cache so cores can easily beat single core at the same load providing better performance and simultaneously demanding less power further reading why and cpu cores in smartphones are good idea lesson from the kitchen why some phones have two quad core processors and some have similar clocked octa core which is better one in terms of performance
176528 the reason is as simple as much as complicate the short answer is because the mobile phone market has never been and is not driven by intel the long answer is way too long to resume here but the basic concept is that intel has dominated the pc market for years with all means possible to the point of paying and corrupting and being fined for this to have his cpus be the first and only choice for pc manufacturers having the total control of the market has allowed intel to inflate the cpu prices while artificially deciding which features and how much processing power the users should have wanted and if you analyse bit intel history youll notice that its main strength is basically in the increase of cpus frequency so it mostly never tried to do something really smart or innovative and it didnt need it because it can just say to people you dont need more cores but have this juicy new cpus which runs mhz faster at the same time it could sell multicore cpus in the server market at absurdly high prices because servers have always needed tons of parallel power to the point that there is current trend in trying to realize servers that use guess what hundred of your cheap phone cpus working in parallel this in turn has reflected into the developers community which has never caught up with the importance of parallel programming so that many if not most of the them never bothered using more than one thread at time or to express it in non technical way having their software do more than one task at time which by the way makes sense when of your customers base has two cores at max sadly this is had led to the legend that parallel algorithms are really difficult to implement and applies only to small subset of problems instead finally the mobile market has never seen intel success quite the contrary actually as it happens most of the time that intel tries to do something different from the usual x86 architecture so lacking is influence and control of the market the other cpus producer have gone in the direction that has been the normality for ages outside the pc market parallel computing
176532 there are two factors going on one very practical and the other historical the practical reason is the use of mixed architectures in phones power consumption is critical for phones and phones spend lot of time in modes where they require very little performance it makes sense to have some cores optimized for minimal power consumption when little performance is needed while having some cores optimized to provide maximum performance when its needed the other reason is largely historical until or so desktop cpus were all single cores improving desktop cpu performance consisted almost exclusively in making core that can execute as many instructions per second as possible even today so much desktop software cannot take full advantage of multiple cores that many would prefer cpu with cores over an core cpu with cores slower getting as much performance out of single core as possible requires huge amounts of cpu real estate this is real estate that could otherwise be used to provide more cores this is why intels newest kaby lake cpus max out at cores and people buy them because each core is faster than their predecessors cores for many they are an upgrade even from cpus with higher core count over time expect to see much more desktop software fully optimized to support more cores as that happens the engineering tradeoffs will start to favor more cores over faster cores on desktops while cores will almost certainly still get faster youll start to see people preferring an core cpu over core cpu even if each core is slower chip designers will follow the market
176549 its crucial for phone to be able to provide computational power in short bursts we need certain apps to be fast but to also avoid overheating heat dissipation is much more difficult for phones than for laptops or pcs in order to accomplish this architects design phones to use single core when the workload is light and provide extra cores to boost performance when it is needed if phones were to use fewer large cores overheating would become problem even when the workload is fairly light source graduate level computer architecture course

176757 impossible if moto themselves did not update your device there is no way you can obtain an authentic system image even when your device is updated motorola is very slow to update the latest image on its website and you would have to depend on images obtained through unofficial means hosted on sites like xda related security patch level old on moto g5
176758 ill supplement the answer of beeshyams since android is still in dev preview phase the source code is still incomplete and no custom rom lineageos etc could even base their work off it lineageos back in their cyanogenmod days also stated time and again that they will not touch dev preview code to reinforce the fact until android is officially released name confirmed and source code out theres no way you can taste it on an unsupported device historically there had been ports of android and dev previews to other devices based on the image released alone however such ports are often conducted between devices of similar socs those ports are nowhere near stable and usable and they quickly become obsolete once the proper release source code arrives
177760 you can use the remote devices feature in the chrome debugger to connect to chrome on the device and access the tabs just expand the list of tabs visible to get the full list and then highlight copy everything shown including the urls to the clipboard https developers google com web tools chrome devtools remote debugging just managed to export tabs this way

181716 some forums state the risk for the wifi network to be spoofed dont understand how the risk is different an attacker could spoof bluetooth device as well the risk is different its not possible to spoof paired bluetooth device the bluetooth peripheral and the phone exchange keys as part of the pairing process so both of them can securely identify the other when the devices connect they each challenge the other to prove they have the secret keys if it didnt work this way it would be trivial to man in the middle attack the connection by pretending to be the peripheral then the attacker could eavesdrop your phone calls or music or whatever it is youre sending over bluetooth authentication works bit differently in wi fi see this question on our sister site super user for more discussion on that in open networks and networks authenticated using wep wpa or wpa2 psk the network doesnt authenticate to the phone at all the phone has to prove that it has the secret key the network password but the network doesnt have to prove anything there are no trusted wi fi networks in this sense only networks authenticated with wpa2 enterprise which use certificate pair prove their identity to the phone by showing certificate signed by certificate authority just like https websites presumably google didnt think it was worth adding an option that would only work with the least common type of wi fi network and the confusion it would cause their users interestingly wi fi spoofing is already security issue for the trusted place option the location system uses visible wi fi networks as one input to determine where you are and as weve seen that can cause huge inaccuracies spoofing this deliberately means looking at the networks that are visible in your trusted place and spoofing several at once your neighbourhood phone snatcher wont be able to unlock your phone this way but government agencies and organised industrial spies probably can especially if they also use screened room to block gps and cellular signals
181763 what you ask would certainly be possible but it should be restricted to when device is connected to wi fi network using sufficient security wpa2 authentication encryption probably it was left out because it would be hard to communicate to non technical user why they could use certain wi fi networks for authentication but not others in contrast to what danhulme wrote in his answer when using wpa2 authentication with pre shared keys wpa2 psk both the station and the ap have to prove that they know the passphrase in the four way handshake rogue wpa2 ap cannot give access to client by just accepting the clients password on the other hand everyone who knows the psk could fake an ap wpa2 enterprise does have an advantage here over wpa2 psk

181875 as suggested already this graphical shadow effect is edge glow colour and its part of the material design by google after the introduction of material design by google many new ui elements have been introduced material design is based on the interaction and movement of colours and objects in real world rather than synthetic unnatural phenomenon sometimes it gets messy when we try to keep up with our material aesthetic the most popular example of it is edge glow colour the effect was introduced in the ice cream sandwich api android version its part of material designs aesthetic appeal the edge glow colour of listview recyclerview scrollview and nestedscrollview is managed by the accent colour declared in the styles source

181951 google is trying to reduce the need for rooting by improving the permitted system services nowadays screenshots screen recording and tethering typically dont require root the reasons can think of to still root to uninstall and or backup default apps to move files and apps around without restrictions copy paste unzip anywhere with root explorer integrate migrate apps from your data partition to the system partition in order to save space and preserve them from factory resets edit your system hosts file to block ads adaway edit your icon resource file txt to include launcher icon for your favorite app etc to run programs with more power more tasker functionality better power management with apps like greenify hook into any app or resource with xposed ricing gravitybox adding unofficial features to the youtube or other popular app fine grained app permission management with xprivacy run command line utilities busybox like remounting your filesystems or scanning all partition files to see what takes up space reverse tethering use my laptop desktop internet via usb or wifi change cpu performance policies online flashing of new image to storage or make full backup the non root way involves recovery fastboot methods
182183 full backup seems to be very overloaded term in the android world allow me to first define it paraphrasing comment full backup is anything that will restore your system state to when you made the backup izzy op so the obvious follow up question should be restore your state from what scenario your phone is physically broken scenario your entire drive emmc has been blanked scenario you can only boot into usb flash mode like fastboot odin scenario you can boot into fastboot and your custom recovery scenario your phone has been reset to factory mode you have normal unrooted functionality scenario your accidentally deleted your favorite cat wallpaper image etc each of these scenarios can have different backup solution full backup would have to be able to address all of them of course im trolling bit with the broken phone scenario but it points out how ill defined this canonical question is this reflects the fact that many people and companies tend to oversimplify backing up and ignore the most important part restoring consider that in the android community it is implied that hardbricks are paperweights youre expected to get new phone so lets divide the remaining backup solutions into categories developer restores typically involves using nandroid sector copy of most partitions and maybe re flashing custom recovery bit technical may affect the warranty consumer restores typically restores apps and data including your cat photos partial restores could work across different models both can be considered full backups for their use cases let the context determine if someone asking for full backup wants option or theres bit of gray area between scenario and if user deleted files from the system partition the restoration method may depend on what is missing beware consumer restores the current most highly voted answer based on adb backup is consumer restore that can restore apps and data with few caveats seems to omit some files variable results depending on the rom doesnt work on some sony models omits different items on cyanogenmod vs touchwiz though recently in oreo there have been small improvements xda news still cant confirm if it can copy all user files like photos and music copied from your pc for dev restore you want nandroid you cant get full nandroid without either rooting or using recovery an exception is perhaps an image of your sd card giving you partial nandroid so you have to risk installing an image or temporarily rooting or wait until oems offer better recoveries remember to name your backups with important information like date and partitions included you dont have to back up what you dont mind recreating nandroid typically doesnt include recovery because they are usually applied from recovery so it is redundant but if your device is messed up and your recovery is gone you might panic thinking you didnt back it up so theres nothing to restore but it is often simple to download and then reinstall the recovery with usb flash tool fastboot similarly if you store your contacts in the cloud there is usually no need to back them up just sync again after restoring remember full backup depends on what you want to recover from there is no perfect solution at the consumer level ive described in eu asian countries where people arent so worried about denial of warranty there is little reason not to install custom recovery if it exists

186348 since ultimately youre deciding whether x86 is still worthy of spending effort to support im listing several facts about x86 for android devices here intel had decided to discontinue the atom line for phones tablets the last generation of handheld atom x3 x5 and x7 series were at best equipped on lower end chinese android tablets some come with phone data capabilities based on x3 c3230rk regardless none made it onto mainstream devices specifically phones the last x86 android device thats widely popular was asus zenfone released in march and even its subsequent variants shifted to qualcomms snapdragon partly due to the compatibility issues android on x86 had back then spreadtrum has partnership with intel and just announced sc9861g ia in march sc9853i in august however this has yet to come to fruition on consumer devices and given spreadtrums focus on low end devices for emerging markets this soc likely wont give much x86 on android much significance edit the first device utilizing the above spreadtrum socs the leagoo t5c is now on pre sale leagoo is small china based firm and the device mainly targets india not to mention another variant of the same device the t5 with conventional soc is sold at the same time so it doesnt change the assumptions above that it will remain unpopular

187417 samsung says you can charge your phone using any samsung approved wall charger but charging speeds may vary depending on the charger further this reddit claims that s7 and s8 use the same charger am not sure what is the difference in charging speeds in the absence of specs it is not possible to say for sure but wouldnt hesitate since both chargers are samsung and apparently similar as pointed in the reddit
187433 as supplemental answer to what beeshyams already wrote s7 comes with ep ta20 series charger capable of qc rated for 9v 67a or 5v 2a on the other hand s8 comes with ep ta200 series charger which is near identical to the former one except that its usb port has been moved from the side to the top and comes with usb cable by default safe to say that as long as you get the usb cable right the two makes no difference pictures courtesy of chongdiantou com chinese forum dedicated to chargers and batteries

189144 though this question is almost years old but think an updated answer can help users looking for updated info nowadays google gets its weather data from weather com as mentioned in bottom left corner of google weather search results when you look for temperature of any location highlighted in red rectangle but as the op says lot of times googles weather data is way off the actual current weather for example as of this writing it shows current temperature in shimla india to be at pm but according to official website of indian weather department or imd even whole days minimum temperature was for jan and minimum temperature of whole day usually happens in early morning hours similarly have matched data for other cities and locations in india and current weather is not what actual current weather is think from wherever google takes its weather data they just provide an average of previous years and not the actual current temperature and various weather websites showing wildly different current temperatures for same location
189336 am on oreo and couldnt find setting for this so ended up using this hide running in the background notification have several apps running in background and disabled them all using this app as it serves no useful purpose for me to know auto notification is another app that has this feature amongst other tasker oriented features if you are interested preferred the first one since dont use tasker edit these are bye the way notifications

189460 there is setting to fix your device to given network settings more mobile networks network operators by default this is set to automatic but theres an option to manually select this will then scan for available networks and let you chose one obviously only possible with the desired network in reach having done that whenever the chosen network is not available youd simply have no network it wouldnt switch to any other operator however strong his signal might be ive often used that in the past before going abroad if wished device to not accidentally roaming even for calls that way my then provider couldnt fool me with costs for twice redirected calls from home to roaming to mailbox at home network manually selecting my home network before departing the device found no suitable network in the target country
189727 problem was that the settings made in the device by manual selection wouldnt stick solution dial and in phone info section preferred network type choose the network type you would like to be always connected to as op noted in their comment the network selection made in settings was not sticking and the selection made in above menu did stick and prevent roaming they chose lte as preferred network
191669 not way to find it but to document that its not possible from google dashboard anymore is it possible to find the imei number of lost android phone using google dashboard unfortunately no google removed this feature for reasons best known to them from google support see what nogooddeed says as catzrule states google has was removed imei information from the new dashboard view google is considering where and if it might be appropriate to re surface that info you can leave feedback about this with gmail this is the latest official source october last year could find so there is no way out unless you have the box or bill mentioning imei other possibilities if you synced to itunes as claimed here cant confirm another very long shot is if you had installed paid app that is single device use and is linked to your imei number have call recorder app that does this and everytime change my device need to mail them with new imei number so end up having record as bochur mentioned in comments thanks asking telco is another possibility wish google would reintroduce this edit things that didnt help chatting with google help from play store options they were totally clueless and couldnt direct me to somebody who can help downloading data from google dashboard combed but to no avail only interesting thing is that you can see your google id here

197205 yes as of july you can still get your imei number from the dashboard just go to the find your device page and select your device then in the upper left corner the name of your device will appear with an icon next to it click on that and it tells you imei number
197233 since you have already initiated the erase procedure the only solution is to prevent the device from contacting google so the wipe command to find my device the google device administrator service on your phone is not received or executed once the erase is initiated from the website the command will go out it cannot be stopped from happening although it can sometimes be mitigated assuming you find the device and it is powered off or the battery is dead do not attempt to turn the device on remove the sim card and disable any wifi that may be in range device such as turning off your wireless router and any network it may automatically connect to if it connects to the internet and google it will wipe all data immediately once you have removed the sim and disabled wifi power on the device as soon as you are able to do so turn on airplane mode then go to settings security device administrators and disable find my devices administration capabilities important things here are usually photos and video in the dcim folder now backup any data via usb to pc sd card or otg flash drive do not attempt to backup to any cloud service install apps or anything else requiring network access verify again that find my device does not have permissions as device administrator by going to settings security device administrators now enable the network access wifi or reinstall sim and verify you can access the internet and your google account such as gmail and continue to use the device for few minutes would suggest backing up anything you needed an app or the cloud to backup that you couldnt earlier such as text messages via sms backup restore app now reboot and make sure everything is working as expected after minutes go back to settings security device administrators and authorize find my device again in many cases the wipe event has passed and the device will not reset but in some instances it still does occur either way realize it could still happen but if it goes hours the wipe event most likely will not occur also note that if it does get wiped you must log back into the device using the same google account and credentials that were on the device previously as it will likely be in factory reset protection frp mode there are few articles mostly dated on the internet regarding this most are fluff so be careful this answer is largely paraphrased from this one which have used before btw next time something like this happens research on the internet first then press the doom and gloom button after you know what it will do not before
197304 the enable secure erase button does not actually erase your device instead what it does is reach out to the device to and turn on the device admin permission for the find my device app so if thats all youve done your data is still fine and you can undo it by going into settings and removing device admin permission despite that id still go with acejavelins paranoid approach if had any un backed up data after you press enable secure erase google contacts your device to enable the feature not erase your device and once google gets an answer back you should see two new buttons lock device and erase device if you then hit erase device your device will be erased and since it was probably online otherwise the two buttons wouldnt have appeared its very likely too late the device has already been erased google does make it very clear what this button does unless you pressed that button you should be fine but again there is no harm in following acejavelins paranoid procedure so recommend being paranoid

201493 android from early on represented an open platform and it helps to get bit of context at time of its release the mobile platform was relatively unique with developer toolchain that worked on windows mac and linux every device could be put into developer mode without the need to register the device with central authorization server see apples ios and later microsofts windows phone distribution of apps on non smartphones was normally done on per carrier basis and some of that behavior persisted through with at removing unknown sources from their phones https forums att com t5 android quot unknown sources quot td and carriers continue to bundle their own apps on devices sold on their network bloatware official developer documentation makes mention of alternative distribution https developer android com distribute marketing tools alternative distribution as an open platform android offers choice you can distribute your android apps to users in any way you want using any distribution approach or combination of approaches that meets your needs from publishing in an app marketplace to serving your apps from website or emailing them directly users you re never locked into any particular distribution platform so if you are app developer once you can afford the devices you could in theory download the free developer tools write the apps test them and deploy corporate environment or region unsupported by google without ever having to interact with google in official capacity third party distribution apps include amazons app store epic games fortnite and droid open source apps with android fine grain install permissions were added so the end user now has the capability of blocking prior authorized apps without blocking others https developer android com studio publish publishing unknown
201494 starting android oreo sideloading installing an app from source other than play store has actually became more secure previously naugat or below when you used to tick unknown sources option it actually universally allowed all apk sources chrome amazon appstore etc means the system didnt care about the source of the apk file now you need to allow individual apps which can be set as source and dont worry that allowed app wont be able to install apps in background you will still need to hit install button to install an app so no security compromises here youll just have peace of mind while hitting install button if youve allowed amazon appstore only then you can be sure that you wont be installing malicious apk which was downloaded in background by an advertiser app

202022 ended up with this conclusion after searching lot useful info in unity stats armv7 intel x86 however was not satisfied so verified it from many resources according to android documentation armeabi was deprecated in r16 removed in r17 no hard float and historically the ndk supported bit and bit mips but support was removed in ndk r17 summery after searching lot mips deprecated mips64 deprecated armeabi deprecated armeabi v7a required most popular architecture nowadays arm64 v8a required newer version of armeabi v7a x86 optional very limited number of devices like asus zenfone genymotion android emulator x86 optional very limited number of devices like asus zenfone genymotion android emulator should also mention that chromebook are using intel processors based x86 and x86 architecture only add these architure when you support chromebook conclusion if you app supports armeabi v7a and arm64 v8a architectures because they have around of android devices important suggestion do you worry about app size you should you should split your apk for multiple abi android studio and play store support uploading multiple apk so that app has only architecture ndk files so this will be much efficient to build multiple apk important links what is abi management and cpu architecture unity stats cpu vendors unity stats on android hardware split apk guide find your device abi largest mobile database

203636 in short code related to service call command are just the arguments of the function and order at which the function occur in the aidl file of that service here is syntax service call your service name number at which the function appears in your service name aidl type of the argument like i32 or i64 argument in detail faced lot of problems to know about it and hence will share the solution with the help of clipboard service first you need to know about the service you are interested in for that you need to look for all the service that is there for particular android system by typing adb shell service list here is what you will get ethernet android net iethernetmanager wifip2p android net wifi p2p iwifip2pmanager rttmanager android net wifi irttmanager wifiscanner android net wifi iwifiscanner wifi android net wifi iwifimanager overlay android content om ioverlaymanager netpolicy android net inetworkpolicymanager netstats android net inetworkstatsservice network score android net inetworkscoreservice textservices com android internal textservice itextservicesmanager network management android os inetworkmanagementservice clipboard android content iclipboard statusbar com android internal statusbar istatusbarservice as am interested in clipboard service here is how it look clipboard android content iclipboard so from here we can summarise that the service name is clipboard service and the package path is android content iclipboard then you need to know the complete path where the iclipboard aidl is to know that you need to search on google for iclipboard aidl you need to look for something from android googlesource com website in the results like in my case https android googlesource com platform frameworks base git android r1 core java android content iclipboard aidl so after android r1 is where your path lies let that path be path of clipboard aidl core java android content iclipboard aidl as these service call codes are dependent on the android system hence you need to know your android os name in my case it is so will go to the following website where google puts there code and select my os version from the left hand side for the page https android googlesource com platform frameworks base in my case it is android r50 will click on it and then after that my url will look like this https android googlesource com platform frameworks base android r51 and then after adding path of clipboard aidl my complete url will look like https android googlesource com platform frameworks base android r51 core java android content iclipboard aidl here there will be many methods in the interface like in my case void setprimaryclipin clipdata clip string callingpackage clipdata getprimaryclipstring pkg clipdescription getprimaryclipdescriptionstring callingpackage boolean hasprimaryclipstring callingpackage void addprimaryclipchangedlistenerin ionprimaryclipchangedlistener listener string callingpackage void removeprimaryclipchangedlistenerin ionprimaryclipchangedlistener listener returns true if the clipboard contains text false otherwise boolean hasclipboardtextstring callingpackage so the code for the first method setprimaryclip will be as it occured at first place and that for the last method hasclipboardtext will be as it occured at seventh place in the aidl file similarly for the other methods so if want to call the seventh method will type adb shell service call clipboard as you might have seen that have not put the callingpackage name as it is not required if the method need arguments then you can pass it like as show in this example let us assume method whose code is in clipboard and that looks like this getdemostring arg1 int arg2 boolean arg3 so will call it like this adb shell call clipboard s16 first argument i32 i32 here i32 stands for bit integer and s16 for the string we can even pass boolean value as an integer as shown in the example in boolean integer stands for true and for false tip keep the logcat openlike in android studio to check for any error that occured while executing that adb command source

205434 storage emulated download is the actual path to the files sdcard download is symlink to the actual path of storage emulated download however the actual files are located in the filesystem in data media which is then mounted to storage emulated and often other mountpoints as well symlink in computing symbolic link is term for any file that contains reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution symbolic links were already present by in minicomputer operating systems from dec and data generals rdos
205494 storage emulated is actually data media exposed through an emulated virtual filesystem not the actual one this is with reference to my previous answer here but with more relevant details android storage on android sdcard storage emulated legacy mnt shell emulated mnt shell emulated data media on android for java android apps running inside zygote virtual machine storage to view bind mount is inside separate mount namespace for every app sdcard storage self primary storage self mnt user user id mnt user user id primary storage emulated user id storage emulated mnt runtime view emulated mnt runtime view emulated data media for services daemons processes in root global namespace view default sdcard storage self primary storage mnt runtime default mnt runtime default self primary mnt user user id primary mnt user user id primary storage emulated user id storage emulated mnt runtime default emulated mnt runtime default emulated data media for symlink for emulated and for bind mount user id of current user in case of multiple users or work profile normally that of device owner view is one of read for apps with permission read external storage or write permission write external storage or default for processes running in root global mount namespace outside zygote there were minor differences on previous android versions but the concept of emulation was same ever since implemented for little bit more details on androids mount namespace implementation see this answer in short sdcard and storage emulated which represent fat vfat fat32 filesystem point towards data media or mnt expand uuid media in case of adoptable storage through fuse or sdcardfs emulation being not android specific but generally linux related symlink and bind mount see creating bind mount are out of the scope of this question as the question is about emulation part mainly emulation why the emulation is here emulated filesystem is an abstraction layer on actual filesystem ext4 or f2fs that serves basically two purposes retain usb connectivity of android devices to pcs implemented through mtp now days restrict unauthorized access of apps processes to users private media and other apps data on sd card read androids storage journey for details the summary is early android devices were short on internal storage and relied on physically external sd cards that traditionally use fat family of filesystem to ensure compatibility with most of the pcs refer to microsofts dominance on pc world when the internal storage grew in size same filesystem was shifted to internal still called external sd card but the fat vfat implementation had two major issues which were addressed by google gradually android devices were connected to pcs directly usb mass storage just as we connect usb drive these days ums exposes the device at block level and disconnects the sd card from android framework un mounts thus making whole data unavailable to apps and possibly breaking many functionalities fat being windows favorite in development days was never designed to enforce unix permissions mode uid gid and likewise symlinks and ioctls like fs ioc fiemap so all data on sd card was available to all apps since every android app is unix linux user and has uid with no restrictions hence raising serious privacy and security concerns both of these issues were addressed through emulation actual sd card storage was moved to data partition or independent sdcard partition on some devices previously which holds ext4 filesystem gradually being replaced by f2fs fully implementing unix permissions this design made using ums impossible because whole data partition could not be exposed to pc for more reasons it contains lot of settings and apps data which is to be protected from other apps as well as human users linux filesystems are not supported by windows so ums was replaced with media transfer protocol which is client server type extension to ptp an already established protocol mtp doesnt expose block device but works through software stack mtp host runs on android as an app android process media fully sandboxed in android framework not capable of doing any escalated tasks now the apps and mtp which is also an app interact with emulated storage instead of data media achieving both purposes at the same time enforcing permission checks underneath and looking like fat filesystem on upper surface google is now implementing emulation through sdcardfs to overcome shortcomings of fuse one major being the input output overhead to improve read write speeds external storage permissions concept of public and private files on external storage can be demonstrated using an example install termux app create directories sdcard android data com termux test dir and sdcard test dir create files sdcard android data com termux test file and sdcard android data com termux test file execute following commands you should have whatsapp installed or select some other apps private folder now force stop the termux app and grant storage permission execute the commands again see the difference in permissions of same files and directories this seems not to be simply possible without emulation on native linux filesystem when there are hundreds of apps users to be dealt with simultaneously this is the filesystem emulation that lets the same file to be exposed with three different sets of permissions at same time independent of its original permissions on actual filesystem touch data media test file stat data media test file data media test file stat mnt runtime emulated test file mnt runtime default emulated test file mnt runtime read emulated test file mnt runtime write emulated test file also see what is the everybody uid related why is the storage emulated directory inaccessible how can make symlink or equivalent inside storage emulated

213168 magisk provides root access by providing working root binary mounted at sbin magisk any application that tries to run this binary will bring up magisk to grant them root access which is in turn managed and maintained by the magisk manager application the boot partition is separate partition that stores some data required to boot the system it includes initialization of some very low level mechanisms like the linux kernel device drivers file systems etc before the upper layer android os is brought up it is separated in way such that linux level stuff is stored in it while android level stuff systemui settings etc is stored in the system partition modifying boot does not count as modifying system the latter of which is what dm verity and avb usually checks and magisk patches and integrates itself into the boot partition so it doesnt touch the system partition at all it uses technique called bind mount to change the content of system files that other programs see without actually modifying the underlying filesystem beneath the system partition so real files are left intact
213344 most part of your question is covered in magisk documentation will quote one of my previous answers to different question with some unnecessary details prerequisites to have comprehensive understanding of how magisk works one must have basic understanding of discretionary access control dac user identifiers esr uid set user id linux capabilities process and file which provide fine grained control over superuser permissions mandatory access control mac selinux on android mount namespaces androids usage of namespaces for storage permissions bind mount android boot process partitions and filesystems android init services the very first process started by kernel rc files structure of boot partition kernel dtb ramdisk device tree blobs dm verity android verified boot full disk encryption file based encryption fde fbe etc what is root gaining root privileges means to run process usually shell with uid zero and all of the linux capabilities so that the privileged process can bypass all kernel permission checks superuser privileges are gained usually by executing binary which has either set user id root suid bit set on it this is how su and sudo work on linux in traditional unix dac non privileged users execute these binaries to get root rights or file capabilities setgidsetuid ep set on it this is the less common method used in both cases the calling process must have all capabilities in its bounding set one of the capabilities categories process can have to have real root privileges how android restricts root access up to android one could simply execute set user id root su binary to elevate its permissions to root user however there were number of security enhancements in android which broke this behavior android switched to file capabilities instead of relying on set user id type of security vulnerabilities more secure mechanism ambient capabilities has also been introduced in android oreo system daemons and services can make use of file capabilities to gain process capabilities see under transformation of capabilities during execve but apps cant do that either because application code is executed by zygote with process control attribute no new privs ignoring set user id as well as file capabilities suid is also ignored by mounting system and data with nosuid option for all apps uid can be switched only if calling process has setuid setgid capability in its bounding set but android apps are made to run with all capabilities already dropped in all sets using process control attribute capbset drop starting with oreo apps ability to change uid gid has been further suppressed by blocking certain syscalls using seccomp filters since the standalone su binaries stopped working with the release of jelly bean transition was made to su daemon mode this daemon is launched during boot which handles all superuser requests made by applications when they execute the special su binary install recovery sh located under system bin or system etc which is executed by pre installed init service flash recovery useless for adventurers updates recovery after an ota installation was used to launch this su daemon on boot the next major challenge was faced when selinux was set strictly enforcing with the release of android flash recovery service was added to restricted selinux context install recovery s0 which stopped the unadulterated access to system even the uid was bound to perform very limited set of tasks on device so the only viable option was to start new service with unrestricted super context by patching the selinux policy thats what was done temporarily for lollipop and then permanently for marshmallow and thats what magisk does how magisk works flashing magisk usually requires device with unlocked bootloader so that boot img could be dynamically modified from custom recovery or pre modified boot img could be flashed booted from fastboot as side note its possible to start magisk on running rom if you somehow get root privileges using some exploit in os however most of such security vulnerabilities have been fixed over time also due to some vulnerabilities at soc level such as qualcomms edl mode locked bootloader can be hacked to load modified boot recovery image breaking the chain of trust however these are only exceptions once the device boots from patched boot img fully privileged magisk daemon with uid full capabilities and unrestricted selinux context runs from the very start of booting process when an app needs root access it executes magisks sbin su binary worldly accessible by dac and mac which doesnt change uid gid on its own but just connects to the daemon through unix socket and asks to provide the requesting app root shell with all capabilities in order to interact with user to grant deny su requests from apps the daemon is hooked with the magisk manager app that can display user interface prompts database data adb magisk db of granted denied permissions is built by the daemon for future use booting process android kernel starts init with selinux in permissive mode on boot with few exceptions init loads sepolicy or split policy before starting any services daemons processes sets it enforcing and then switches to its own context from here afterwards even init isnt allowed by policy to revert back to permissive mode neither the policy can be modified even by root user therefore magisk replaces init file with custom init which patches the selinux policy rules with super context magisk s0 and defines the service to launch magisk daemon with this context then the original init is executed to continue booting process systemless working since the init file is built in boot img modifying it is unavoidable and system modification becomes unnecessary thats where the systemless term was coined main concern was to make otas easier re flashing the boot image and recovery is less hassle than re flashing system block based ota on modified system partition will fail because it enables the use of dm verity to cryptographically sign the system partition system as root on newer devices using system as root kernel doesnt load ramdisk from boot but from system so system img init needs to be replaced with magisks init also magisk modifies init rc and places its own files in root and sbin it means system img is to be modified but magisks approach is not to touch system partition on devices during normal boot skip initramfs option is passed from bootloader in kernel cmdline as boot img contains ramdisk for recovery so magisk patches kernel binary to always ignore skip initramfs boot in recovery and places magisk init binary in recovery ramdisk inside boot img on boot when kernel boots to recovery if theres no skip initramfs user intentionally booted to recovery then magisk init simply executes recovery init otherwise system img is mounted at system root by magisk init contents of ramdisk are then copied to cleaning everything previously existing files are added modified in rootfs system root system is bind mounted to system and finally system init is executed however things have again changed with now system is mounted at but the files to be added modified like init init rc and sbin are overlaid with bind mounts on non system as root devices magisk needs to be installed to recovery ramdisk in order to retain systemless approach because boot img contains no ramdisk modules an additional benefit of systemless approach is the usage of magisk modules if you want to place some binaries under system bin or modify some configuration files like hosts or dnsmasq conf or some libraries framework files such as required by mods like xposed in system or vendor you can do that without actually touching the partition by making use of magic mount based on bind mounts magisk supports adding as well removing files by overlaying them magiskhide another challenge was to hide the presence of magisk so that apps wont be able to know if the device is rooted many apps dont like rooted devices and may stop working google was one of the major affectees so they introduced safetynet as part of play protect which runs as gms play services process and tells apps including their own google pay and hence their developers that the device is currently in non tampered state rooting is one of the many possible tempered states others being un verified boot unlocked bootloader cts non certification custom rom debuggable build permissive selinux adb turned on some bad properties presence of lucky patcher xposed etc magisk uses some tricks to make sure that most of these tests always pass though apps can make use of other android apis or read some files directly some modules provide additional obfuscation other than hiding its presence from googles safeynet magisk also lets users hide root su binary and any other magisk related files from any app again making using of bind mounts and mount namespaces for this zygote has to be continuously watched for newly forked apps vms however its tough task to really hide rooted device from apps as new techniques evolve to detect magisks presence mainly from proc or other filesystems so number of quirks are done to properly support hiding modifications from detection magisk tries to remove all traces of its presence during booting process magisk also supports disabling dm verity and data encryption by modifying fstab in ramdisk vendor or dtb see how to disable dm verity on android changing read only properties using resetprop tool modifying boot img using magiskboot and modifying selinux policy using magiskpolicy executing boot scripts using init like mechanism thats brief description of magisks currently offered features afaik further reading how does supersu provide root privilege how to manually root phone android partitions and filesystems android boot process what special privileges system xbin su does have root access what sepolicy context will allow any other context to access it
214817 pull down the notification shade if it looks like this it is android if it looks like this it is android
214838 wanted to turn some of the comments into an answer that can be used for additional verification in case someone else runs into similar issue where the vendor also reskinned the notifications window android was released in march the security patch level is may this doesnt make sense at all would you trust it if the vaccination card for month old toddler says the most recent vaccinations were given months before he was born not to mention that id really recommend against using phone which is over years out of date on security patches the kernel version also doesnt match android has one of kernel version or the stated version matches that of android the build number also is cause for concern mra58k is related to the android rom and vendors are not supposed to use test keys for released products overall these are all causes for concern this device has been tampered with either rooted and the build prop edited or full rom edit and poorly at that since if they were competent chances are theyd have edited the above values as well to be less suspicious there is no way to know what other changes they made at best theyre trying to mislead you at worst theyre spying on your and stealing your money urge you to get refund if thats not possible recommend you install clean version of android so you have less reason to worry about malicious intrusions however that might not be enough because there might be intrusions in the device either hardware or software that can interfere with anything you do with the device agree with the others though that its security risk to use the device as is
215550 app developers can tell better but what perceive is that many modern apps use firebase cloud messaging proprietary service from google not part of aosp for push notifications in fact developers are forced to use googles proprietary products unnoticeably quoted from here the doze restriction on network access is also likely to affect your app especially if the app relies on real time messages such as tickles or notifications if your app requires persistent connection to the network to receive messages you should use firebase cloud messaging fcm if possible fcm is optimized to work with doze and app standby idle modes by means of high priority fcm messages fcm is part of google play services fcm sdks only hard dependency is google play services play services is set of apps which are injected to android devices with highly privileged permissions so they arent subject to data battery restrictions since you have blocked only the app and not play services app may receive push notifications though the actual data may not be delivered to the app so block gms in order to block push notifications or choose the apps which arent fond of google related what is the exact functionality of google play services services framework
216086 it lists apps that have the permission to install other apps the permission is found on the apps manifest for example file manager can install an apk same case with browser or whatsapp if contact sends an apk to you they are labelled unknown apps because the apps are not installed via google play store thus not trusted by google that does not mean that there is something wrong with the file from andrew ts comment the permission is request install packages that allows an application to request installing packages apps targeting apis greater than must hold this permission in order to use intent action install package note api is for android
216092 just to add some related details to reddylutonadios answer android permission request install packages is the one which defines which apps would appear in the list you have mentioned and its required on android to install apps from sources other than google play but this permission alone doesnt define if the app is allowed to install unknown packages or not it has protection level signature the system grants these app permissions at install time but only when the app that attempts to use permission is signed by the same certificate as the app that defines the permission it means that user apps will never be allowed this permission the apps which are allowed in settings apps notifications advanced special app access install unknown apps are those which have appops operation op request install packages allowed you can also check from adb shell appops query op request install packages allow results must be same as in settings to deny any of the apps appops set org fdroid fdroid request install packages deny and it will appear as not allowed in settings other permissions which are controlled with appops can be seen with dumpsys package grep a100 appop permissions sed related how to grant an app permission that isnt in its manifest
216715 whatsapp cant access the internet at then moment however it still receives the configured push notifications via google play services the google play service is different app on your device that still has internet access those push messages dont contain the actual message and whatsapp just uses them as notifier whenever such push notification message arrives whatsapp knows that there are new messages and tries to contact the whatsapp server to retrieve it in your case the connection to the whatsapp server fails and whatsapp only displays you the message you might have new messages
216719 no whatsapp does not hack around the network restrictions the app after certain amount not being able to connect to its server because you have disabled internet connection is just guessing thats why you get the message you may have new messages from its failure notifications channel from how to stop whatsapp you may have new messages notification as such though whatsapp is running and mobile data is turned on it may not be able to access the internet its only recourse is therefore to throw this notification as guess since suspect it can tell the difference when poor network is to blame and when its network rights are being micromanaged by the os
217961 it is possible with samsung find my mobile feature register here and youll be able to make loud sound even if your phone is in silent mode
217962 you can automate the process install macrodroid on the old phone open it and add macro then follow the steps below in the triggers tab in the call sms section select call incoming then select contacts choose your phone number in the actions tab in the volume section select volume change give the appropriate permission to macrodroid select volume change enable ringer and set the volume percentage in the constraints tab in the screen and speaker section select ringer volume then silent save the macro give it name
217963 you may consider using googles find my device web version app would not suggest third party app from unreliable sources although you cant trust google as well
217970 is there way to make one specific number always ringing loud even if the phone is in silent mode another solution could be that instead of putting the phone in silent mode you can set the default ringtone to silent audio file then you can set normal ringtone for the contact of the number you want to call from
218046 another solution would be using termux my favourite app in silimar cases can ssh to my phone from my computer adjust volume with termux volume play some sound file with mpv or activate the motor with termux vibrate
218275 theoretically the og pixel will work indefinitely until theres an irreparable software hardware issue realistically depends on how the user takes care of it end of life eol doesnt mean that the device will end its life it is just that the manufacturer in this case google will stop its support no more security os updates and the like if the user is adventurous enough they can unlock the bootloader warning will delete all the storage and flash custom rom which at least extends the life little further in addition seems its also compatible with project fi anecdotal evidence im using nexus which was released in android ice cream sandwich and eol in android marshmallow flashed lineage os after that until its not maintained android nougat as of the phone is still usable in daily life
218276 if google declares device to be eol this simply means that you no longer receive device and security updates therefore your android devices will not stop working however after the point of eol the chance of security vulnerability that allows to attack you and your data will continuously raise however as google devices can be unlocked easily you dont have to accept this unlocking the bootloader allows you to install an os that does not come from google like lineageos warning unlocking will erase all user data the first pixel code name sailfish is supported device by lineageos therefore you can download and install lineageos on your device and again receive updates until lineageos also drops support for your device but there are also some draw backs of unlocking and installing linegeos some device assume that lineageos devices are rooted and therefore insecure they just assume that in general independendently of the reality therefore apps like googlepay may refuse to work
