2379 the interaction between google talk via gmail and google talk via the android client seems confusing heres my understanding of how things work if chat is started in gmail it will sync in near real time to talk if chat is started in talk it will show up in the chat history in gmail but will not spawn new chat in gmail so the chat is confined to talk if chat is started in gmail and continued in talk messages will stop being sent to the chat in gmail and new messages will be sent to talk as well as the chat history in gmail in my short experience this transition can be bit flaky is this basically how it works what id love to see is perfect sync between gmail and talk that is if start chat in talk it will create new chat tab in gmail and everything will get pushed to both and vice versa anyone know if thats in the pipeline or even possible now how does everyone else handle moving as seamlessly as possible between gmail and talk thanks
2432 need to reinstall my android rom but before would like to backup my angry birds savegame data scores do you have any idea how can do it
2437 surprisingly havent found satisfactory answer for this in faq somewhere or anything have motorola droid with froyo if it matters am thinking about getting samsung galaxy tab pretty simple question what will happen if attach the same google account to the tablet what do not want to happen is for the new device to automatically download all of the same apps from my phone especially the ones that dont make sense on wifi only non phone device and especially if the installed apps on both devices need to always stay synchronized what want is to be able to sync contacts gmail calendar etc on both devices bonus question it would be nice if my paid apps were available for re download on the new device but that isnt even necessary so was thinking about creating new google account just for the sake of apps on the new device and adding my gmail account as secondary on the tablet so the bonus question is would this option be better plan if it would work at all

3129 with the release of the firesheep plug in for firefox it has become trivial for website browsing on open wi fi networks to be hijacked by 3rd party listeners android offers the convenient auto sync option however fear that my data may be auto syncd while am connected to an open wi fi network while at the local coffee shop or shopping mall is all the data android auto syncs encrypted using ssl or similar encryption mechanism is any auto syncd data unencrypted and transmitted in the clear for all to listen in to update completely insecure see below

3396 following on from an earlier question that posed on how to free up space on my android phone it became clear that key issue is to request that more developers allow their applications to be moved to the sd card what is the best way to let the developers of my favourite apps know of this request considered giving them low rating in the market and writing in the comment that would give them stars if they included the move to sd card option however since really like the applications and want them to be widely adopted to encourage further development on them dont really want to turn away potential new users by giving low rating

3978 it seems that some apps default to saving to sd card when theyre first installed on froyo rather than defaulting to internal memory this is annoying because whenever mount the sd card as storage in windows the icons for those apps disappear from my home screen and have to go into the apps list and find them to add them back onto the home screen if even notice theyve gone have galaxy with over 4gb of internal memory free so have absolutely no worries about apps taking up space on the internal storage or running out of memory so id like to use that space and save the sd storage for my files ie pictures movies and music apps that had somehow moved themselves onto my sd card when checked just now were sliceit and open signal maps in the past remember that both angry birds and angry birds seasons had done this too until moved them back onto the phone in fact thought for bit that angry birds seasons had replaced angry birds as the original disappeared from the home screen around the same time that installed seasons then got suspicious few days later when seasons disappeared too and found them both on the sd

4570 one of the first things that noticed on my nexus one as turned it on the first time was gmail talk voice maps google calendar and many other google based services know that even on windows or linux pc its very hard to avoid using google but it is possible as there are alternatives to every service that google offers on the android however things seem to be very tight you may recall the time in which internet explorer owned over of the market share simply because it was tightly integrated with windows back then netscape was available but even if it performed as fast as internet explorer starting it would take considerably longer so my questions are what are the non google alternatives to gmail talk voice maps google calendar on the nexus one do they really perform as fast as the native google apps services

5043 started wondering about this when realized most websites visit have white backgrounds and know that the screen is usually responsible for most of the battery usage since cant change the background in those sites might at least switch my wallpaper to black one most all phones need back lighting to brighten the screen when needed since that back lighting consumes battery is it correct to state that white screen consumes energy at faster rate than black one assuming the same brightness level in the settings im assuming that white screen needs stronger back lighting but dont know if its the case

5153 ive been thinking about getting pre owned samsung fascinate from verizon for cant afford month unlimited data plan but was considering the month 150mb data plan im planning on using it primarily as phone pmp without heavy use of internet related features most of my data usage will probably come from these things downloading apps occassionally checking weather maps etc texting through google voice plan all cancelling my texting plan and moving all my texting activities to google voice only use around texts sent and received per month is it reasonable to expect these activities to remain within 150mb month on related note am usually on my universitys campus which has wi fi can use the wi fi network to avoid suffering data charges update verizon ran promotion this weekend for upgrading to smartphone with unlimited data plan you got month credit for the next months so the unlimited data plan effectively becomes unlimited and went with that instead of the 150mb plan

5673 ran into serious sms bug which knowledgeable users seem to be saying means the sms message database is corrupt source source this is consistent with my current experience in my case lost all messages and still have some issues after that so want to factory reset my phone while have not rooted my phone have performed significant customization and have somewhere around apps installed including few paid apps ultimatejuice what things do need to explicitly backup what can do to minimize the pain dont care about save points in games surprisingly cannot find any good documentation of this using any obvious google search terms am aware of how do perform full pre rooting backup of an android phone which doesnt really offer an answer to my question for google cloud things such as contacts do need to backup the cloud version just in case so the phone doesnt wipe them from the cloud fortunately most of my personal notes are stored in cloud applications like catch and evernote presume these should be unaffected as far as can tell the backupmysettings option is not available for my phone samsung epic running my paid apps come back from market anyway right guess could pay for mybackuppro if it really made things simpler but there would need to be some way to not backup the corrupted sms database files also am assuming carrier bundled apps such as swype will automatically work have marigold android backup and backed up to the sd card except sms mms also have miq but im not sure trust that to do restore factory resetting the phone will not affect the sd card correct have appbrain is that automatically remembering all apps have on the phone so it will suggest installing all of them if just install appbrain or will it only do that for apps installed through appbrain

6199 since android can be installed on wide range of devices im wondering how important ram and the cpu speed are to the performance of device there are always tradeoffs when something is increased and another one decreased is more ram or faster processor better for general browsing and less mulititasking what if im interested in gaming or doing lots of things at once will more ram make up for slower processor or vice versa

6458 if you were to install home screen application that does not give you access to the system settings screen to go to manage applications and also does not let you launch apps such as the market app or 3rd party install unistallers is there any way to uninstall such an application know that android requires your permission before letting new app take over the home screen privilege but say youre trying newly published launcher app that is buggy or malicious you are of course still going to tell android its ok to give this app the home screen privilege now once it is installed your phone is now effectively useless is there way for typical end user who doesnt have eclipse adb to get out of this situation other than doing complete factory reset realize there are ways to uninstall an app via adb adb uninstall package name but it seems like typical end user is potentially screwed if they ever install such malicious buggy app this seems like gaping security hole in android no

7133 have an old motorola droid that is no longer subscribed on any verizon service still use it for things like web browsing ebooks and along with some wireless stereo headphones music ive already turned off 3g data usage evdo by disabling the enable data option under mobile network settings however when turn off the cell radio cdma bluetooth is also disabled first observed this problem on the stock android firmware now my phone is rooted running on an android based firmware cyanogenmod why disable the cellular radio simply put want to turn it off because dont use it moreover it uses battery life and cpu time even if relatively small amounts ive tried two different methods of disabling the cellular radio but both ended up doing the same thing turning on airplane mode then re enabling wi fi this has the expected consequence of also disabling bluetooth using the phone info menu by dialing info and pressing turn off radio this actually just turns on airplane mode as you can see even though wi fi does stay on airplane mode disables bluetooth the headphones wont sync until turn off airplane mode which of course turns the cell radio back on in both cases airplane mode is enabled so bluetooth gets disabled but now that the device is rooted should be able to disable the cellular radio without using airplane mode at all how can do that

8851 all of sudden my samsung galaxy claims to not support mp3 files the phone has been idle for few hours did not touch anything ogg files however still play without problems when this happens no app can play mp3 files my custom ring tone is not played anymore it just vibrates as if it were muted reboot of the phone fixes the issue but within days the problem comes back it does not make difference if files are stored on internal or external sd card this also affects video playback im just not sure if it happens at the same time or independent of each other the youtube app can no longer start videos unknown playback problem and the video player app claims all video files as unsupported suppose the issue may not be the video playback itself but the audio codec used in the video mp3 any idea how to fix this or debug this dont want to reboot my phone every couple of days it takes minutes to do this and phone should just work applied firmware lately and this only seemed to make the problem worse had this before with but only very rarely im curious if titaniumbackup may be the culprit as the backup scheduler seems to stop processes sometimes maybe others experiencing this issue use scheduled titaniumbackups too the hint was that since upgrading to also upgraded to the licensed titaniumbackup version and scheduled daily backups but this may just be coincidence what contradicts this theory backups are scheduled at night but last time saw this issue it happened during the day mp3 worked in the morning failed in the afternoon the phone was idle during the time it decided to no longer play mp3 looking at forums only found few hits in google people having the same problems suggest to simply reboot the phone but that is no fix at all or they suggest to send the phone back for replacement and guess what it has not fixed the problem for people experiencing this issue so suggest it is not hardware issue neither related to sdcards nor to the phone itself

8979 so understand the first thing need to do with my phone after rooting is to back everything up but was confused about of the apparently popular tools used for this for example is nandroid an application run on computer connected to the android device or on the device itself understand clockworkmod is custom recovery what does that mean why do need it what does it mean to flash it asides from browsing and installing new roms how does rom manager interact with the other two does it include them both so just need to download it from the market and be done with it will appreciate any answer that can sort out the differences with emphasis on what as an end user actually need to do and whether there is any risk on those actions

16698 my wife has decided to get the kids set of android tablets for christmas these are coby kyros 4gb wi fi only models the kids are ages so don particularly want to let them have free reign of the internet or the app stores also want to make sure the tablets are protected from the various forms of malware ideally would like to be able to establish white list for the websites they are allowed to visit and make it so that they are not able to add any apps or modify the white list without parental intervention however am not familiar enough with the android platform to know where to start on any of this google has helped me find out that apps exist which claim to be able to restrict access to other apps but almost all of them have comments indicating that they are very easy to bypass likewise have been seeing mixed reviews as to the effectiveness and value of the antivirus options that are out there so far have not been able to find anything about building whitelist or restricting content accessible from the web so am asking for suggestions as to specific topics apps that should be reading up on and or other approaches that can take to reach these goals edit should note that this model does not come with the android market pre installed it has some third party app store on it it does come with an apk manager installed and have played with one of them enough to get the market and gmail onto it so should be able to get most anything installed removed if can figgure out what it is actually need to do
16847 it was noted in another thread that it should be possible to build up white list for an android device using the etc hosts file would like to experiment with this idea does anyone have any guidance to offer as to how to go about it it has been many years since played with that area of networking but from what remember the host file allows you to specify an ip for an url which overrides the published dns settings with that it is fairly easy to build list of content that want to have accessible or explicitly blocked but am not sure how that helps prevent access to other content am not aware of and so far google has not showed me any way to tell the host file to intercept all other requests does android support some form of wild card in the hosts file or is there some way to disable dns regardless of the active network connection should note that the devices am worried about at the moment are wi fi only tables running android am willing to root them if necessary

18232 every now and then red star icon appears on my brothers notification bar as shown below the message related to this notification is some advert like turbo boost your battery he has been installing software from doubtful places so my guess it is some sort of malware he accidentally installed im not very familiar with android but my guess was to identify the process responsible for the notification so checked the process list but nothing out of the ordinary was shown tried force closing all processes some returned although all of them originated from htc or his carrier but nothing made the star disappear how can the malware be detected and removed notification icon notification message
18242 want to buy an android phone however with everything that is happenning in the it world today all the backdoors carrier iq stuff and so on am more and more convinced want trully open os that means without proprietary applications without proprietary drivers binary blobs or at least with at least of this as possible stallman style know that one fully open phone is openmoko phone but thats not an android and it has very outdated hardware is there another possibility see that this question on android se was marked as unconstrictive for some reason hope this wont be too

18601 ive done lot of reading into rooting of android devices really want to know exactly what is going on at each step before commit to the process im little confused as to where the superuser apk and su files come from it doesnt look like they are official google files but rather files created by random individual that said how safe are these files from research have general understanding of their purpose was wondering if anyone knew what these files were executables scripts what they contained and how they generally work thanks
18644 realize this is long shot but my phone was lost or stolen few hours ago at the time it was stolen didnt have any specific applications installed to track it or wipe the data so my bad im hoping the fact that have pattern lock will at least prevent anyone from accessing my data my question is do have any options for tracking or data wipe after the fact im more interested in tracking note have read similar questions but unless im mistaken they all address the question in terms of preparation before losing the phone im asking about fallback options after losing the phone
18892 after being annoyed with my previous rom thought id install ics on my sgs2 until cm9 comes out but sadly it now reboots several times day without any real reason the device is just lying there on the table doing nothing and every now and then the screen turns on and can watch it reboot so how would start to analyse this issue obviously could try to flash different roms like mad man until the issue resolves itself but would prefer more sensible approach
18948 ive bought used htc magic with cyanogenmod on it it has google market the market version is which is nowhere near the latest iirc in app billing for one thing is not supported isnt google market supposed to upgrade itself when new version comes out why doesnt mine do so probably some kind of cyanogenmod interference any good way around that please edit debugged the situation little bit happen to know that market updating happens out of the main market process the market com android vending downloads the update then fires broadcast intent update market to receiver in another app com android vending updater which in turn installs the package heres what got in the logcat activitymanager121 permission denial broadcasting intent act com android vending update market dat content downloads download from com android vending pid uid requires com android vending permission update market due to receiver com android vending updater com android vending updater updatemarketreceiver so it looks as if the market app lacks permission to invoke the updater the manifest file of vending apk however does have uses permission android name com android vending permission update market line how is it possible for an app to have uses permission but receive permission denial message edit2 the permission com android vending permission update market is marked as signature in the marketupdater manifest meaning only apps signed by the same certificate as marketupdater are granted that permission that could be the reason market is not granted the permission could be signed by different certificate edit3 thats exactly the case the public key is different the one on vending apk seems to match that on various versions of vending apk that are floating around the net
19000 google maps seems to have an insane amount of intents registered for it as well as other ways of being started since this is pretty resource hungry app especially memory wise would very much want it permanently not running unless until actually need it however android keeps starting it all the time for example when the connectivity status changes which for me happens pretty frequently indoors or gps network location changes is there some way of ensuring that google maps doesnt start any processes guaranteed until click on an icon to deliberately launch it environment droid running rooted stock froyo have autostarts and advanced task killer as well as pro version of titanium backup installed im fairly open to almost any method as long as its reliable it lets me use google maps with intended functionality once do need it without requiring minutes of work to re configure ideally doesnt require me to reboot to use it but this one is not deal killer would strongly prefer generic method which would be applicable to other applications not just google maps im software developer with hefty dose of unix linux system administration experience in other words solutions which require shell prompt or writing running shell scripts or perl in android scripting environment are extremely welcome solutions involving writing my own java android app are acceptable as long as they are detailed enough than total android development newbie can get at least some work done without being lost things tried killing the processes via task killer is not working they come back up either immediately or in little while probably via intents but not certain standard methods of getting rid of gmaps issues log out of latitude shut down gps and network locator this seems to help lot but find the need to permanently shut down gps locator to be unacceptable it wont let me run locale app or locale based tasker things freeze via titanium backup pro this requires reboot and generally not very pleasant possible approaches thought of but dont know how to do are somehow fully eliminate turn off all intents registered by google maps when not needed problems first dont know what all the intents google maps uses second the only practical way of doing that that know of is autostarts app which is not workable solution it takes mins to find and re enable all the intents am aware of autostarts is really poor at per app intent management its centered on per intent never mind possible intents that autostarts does not know about its black box dont know which intents are missed if any have script which will rename the jars or whatever the executable files on android are entire apk from say googlemaps apk to googlemaps disabled apk and back problem dont know if this is possible to do on rooted froyo also google maps was pre installed on droidx so would renaming somehow only affect the update but not the original app have script which will go into the apk and rename move empty out manifest file to remove any intents for that app problem would this require recompile it definitely requires reboot which is minus

19339 whats the best way to record video with high quality audio specifically this is for presentation where microphone could be placed by the speaker know that an app that records with the right codec is necessary but what about the microphone id prefer to use usb mic but even though android supports usb host mode it doesnt appear that this is easy to accomplish what about 5mm microphone would that yield acceptable results or would it be better to stick with the built in microphone are any of the video recording apps capable of handling the microphone
19368 how do use an external microphone on my galaxy nexus and what kind do need know if it should use jack plug mm but not all jack connectors are the same and dont know if the lower or middle or upper part is for the microphone want to use my phone for video conference but there is going to be lot of noise around me so need an external microphone without all the background noise which the microphone in the phone gives dont think the gnex can handle usb mic through the micro usb port correct me if im wrong

19673 possible duplicate where does google music store offline songs have about gigs of music stored within google music and recently got sick of streaming and risking data charges so painstakingly allowed it to be stored offline so my fresh gig sd card now only had gigs left then flashed new rom thinking that all my music would still be there cached or however it works but was wrong when click show offline tracks only within the google music app it shows nothing yet my sd card still only has gigs of space left so my question is where are these offline tracks stored on my sd card so can go in and delete them to free up space so can back them all up again thanks and also why wont the app recognize that there is offline music stored on my sd card after new rom is flashed figured that data would be untouched across roms

19935 android market has just updated an app in my device liked the update but its fully different from last version which was also my favorite so want to keep last version too have last versions apk thanks to titanium backup but cant install it without replacing current one android architecture sucks is there any way to do this hacks etc note want to keep current version which must be connected with market to receive future updates
19987 the recent apps list in ice cream sandwich added the ability to swipe apps out of the list thereby dismissing them permanently and as far as know this is vanilla function not cm custom rom one the documentation and platform highlights dont appear to cover the under the hood workings of this functionality but im curious to know what the system is actually doing further adding to my curiosity decided to do quick test started up music on cm9 install then backed out of it then checked the recent apps list and saw it was indeed there and in the proper state based on the thumbnail then went into settings applications and force stopped the music app but it was still listed in the recent list leading me to believe its not connected to processes lingering in the background realizing now that music may have been poor choice also tested with the usa today app this exhibited basically the same behavior and it seemed like it was forced to relaunch after the force stop which makes sense though the thumbnail in the recent apps list didnt reflect this cached im guessing so what actually happens at the os level when you swipe an app out of the recent list does it simply clear the apps data out of ram and garbage collect it destroying its saved state

21019 im about to buy samsung galaxy ace its not much expensive and think its pretty good phone however everyone has been complaining with the battery life but admitting that isnt bad compared to all the other smartphones read about how to save battery with tips tricks and ill certainly do it but id like to know whether battery life would increase recharging it only when completely empty some old phones used to gain life expectancy from that dont know if things are changed now
21112 im planning to buy new android phone and id like to be able to transfer the progress have made at several games to the new device so wont have to play all the levels again from scratch currently have an htc desire and will buy an htc evo 3d theres probably no simple general solution to this but was wondering if anyone did something similar and could provide some advice where to look for files that might hold game progress information
21144 the samsung galaxy tab comes with special charger which im assuming provides higher current output than the usb standard without it the device can actually die even if the usb cord is plugged in to usb port albeit little less quickly im looking for other cheaper ac and car adapters but dont know the minimum power they need to provide to power the device does anyone know the minimum current needed for 5v usb connection for the galaxy tab or perhaps link that provides this information
21149 am new user of android phone used to own an iphone dont remember needing an apple account besides using it to download applications from app store now need gmail account to do even some of the basic stuff like finding my location on google map is google violating my privacy why am forced to log in to gmail permanently to use android update from eren tantekins comment it seems that apple is using its own application to run google map that may be the reason why google account is not required from richard borcsiks comment it seems that apple is collecting location data as well this am not aware of with the background knowledge above would take eldarerathiss comment as the accepted answer apologise if this appears to be rant to anyone just want some clarification thanks
21171 this is definitely noob question im not an engineer but as far as my knowledge goes the power supply on phone would be its battery however my nexus one stopped turning on recently the battery charges fine as the led indicator shows but when try to turn it on get nothing this is the result of me taking the phone apart and trying to clean the contacts of the sim slot as it wasnt recognizing sim cards and after putting it back together cant seem to turn it on anymore then took the phone to repair center and the guy told me the power supply is bad that he would have to replace it the battery is fine but its not getting power to the device so my question is what is this power supply he speaks of the battery is fine and hes obviously not talking about the power adapter and what could cause this power supply to fail followed the directions here to take apart
21296 have an android phone which is connected to secured wi fi hotspot how can find out the password of the hotspot from the phone
21307 looking at the responses to this question it seems that mobile service provider cant automatically detect whether or not phone user is tethering their phone or not though they can infer it by the type of activity user does however my service providor charges extra for both usb and wifi tethering they can provide accurate usage statistics and charge by the data packet so they must have some deliberately set up way of monitoring this believe the most likely way of doing this is they likely have some kind of software built into my installation of android that reports whether or not im tethering so does that mean if root my device and then presumeably that software is gone they wont be able to tell anymore im weighing the risks and rewards of rooting my phone and whether or not could bypass their nickel and diming by charging extra for tethering would be deciding factor
21320 have rooted galaxy i9100 and was wondering if can restart the bluetooth on my phone via the terminal client on my phone

21645 after updating my uk htc sensation to android was keen to try out face unlock im happy to say that it works reasonably well however the setup process has led to me having query when setting up face lock after your face has been captured for the first time and setting up your backup access you are given the following prompt youve finished to unlock your phone just look at it tip improve face matching by having your face captured in different conditions the tip sounds good however it doesnt actually tell you how to have your face captured in different conditions after clicking ok to the prompt you are returned to the security menu and any attempt to re set up face unlock just seems to over write your previous settings or at least assume it does as it asks you to set up new backup system how can recapture my face multiple times to improve face recognition
21750 ive been searching and hoping to find an app for android that syncs up with google reader and has one key feature the feature im looking for is the ability to fetch the entire news article that youre reading certain websites cbc news in canada for example allow you to read more however this opens new browser instance to view the rest of the article im looking for the ability to have that content scraped inside the application for reading reeder for ipad has this functionality does anyone know of an app for android that does the same

22884 or how do root my device without rooter rooting instructions for android devices that have seen are typically of the following form download gingerbreak apk run gingerbreak click root device observe that superuser apk has been magically installed possibly along with busybox and other things and enjoy your rooty goodness what am wanting to know is this how does the rooting actually happen what does gingerbreak do understand the end result of rooting su is present and working superuser apk is installed and controls access to su various utilities are present provided by busybox optional also think understand the basic idea of how gingerbreak gets started it exploits some local privilege escalation vulnerability and uses its new found powers to deploy superuser and whatever else is necessary so unless am wrong in some of the understanding laid out above the core of thing want to know is what the root installer does to deploy and activate superuser it seems that just putting superuser apk in the right place wouldnt be enough how does it get allowed root access how does it get hooked up to moderate that access for other applications what does gingerbreak do post exploit to enable and secure root access
22997 im sure many people like me are aware and annoyed by the extremely limited amount of ram in nexus 512mb but only is usable have searched all over google for solution to increase the amount of ram available and came up empty tried swap file applications but they just broke my systems sd card partitions causing complete reset wonder if there is any hardware solution to this problem is it possible to swap the chip out for bigger capacity one realize that it is not as simple as swapping out pc ram from dimm but havent seen any schematics for the chip layout on the arm boards in the smartphones so really hope that it is somewhat possible to increase the amount of ram on the board

23938 since smartphones have become the thing it has somehow been decided that locking your phone to particular primary mail address and having drm is okay android despite being open source is somehow not the exception since android is open source however it would seem that developer would be able to customize it to remove the primary email restriction on the phone and to unlock all purchased applications to be available to whomever is using the phone at the time only requiring sign in to purchase new applications or when using certain applications dont currently use android and bought windows phone only to find that it does the exact same thing as android and most other phone operating systems are there any android projects that are attempting to move android towards drm less environment

26733 newb question as just received my wifes htc desire where can check how much bandwidth it uses or used during certain time period her contract only includes 500mb month so she needs to be able to monitor this
26809 have htc desire with norwegian language set up in google play all program descriptions are translated to norwegian find this quite annoying because most of the translations are bad and looks quite silly in norwegian sometimes need to imagine what it would be in english to understand what it say is it possible to force the google play app to display all texts in original language edit have realized that the issue is different for different apps examples applock by domobile lab this one is the description shown as badly translated to norwegian in google play on my phone when go to google play in browser on my pc it shows description in english my pc has english system language and have set up google settings to use english mindfeud by monkeybin studios this is shown with english description in google play on my phone but it has button next to the description header you can click on to translate which is function in google play probably using google translate this is exactly how want it to be tvguiden by meetv as this is norwegian app and of course has good norwegian description in google play on my phone this is also fine with me since it is proper translation when go to google play in browser on my pc it shows description in english which is evidence that it provides description both in english and norwegian in this case its most likely written in norwegian and additionally translated to english in example suspect the app vendor have translated using automatic tool and reports to google play having translation for that language in example the app vendor does not claim to have translation to norwegian so in this case it is shown in google play in english with button that the user can choose to get it translated example has truly proper norwegian translation done by humans so the app vendor reports correctly to have translation for norwegian it would be interesting to get experience from others on this app if it will be shown in english for users that has phone language set to other than norwegian example hungarian is this the result of some app vendors ref example misunderstand how the translation system in google play is supposed to work

27071 have nexus running jelly bean using the android file transfer program was examining the contents of part of the internal drive and found this android data com google android videos files movies bwf0dghldy5ob2x0qgdtywlslmnvbq framework lfl4unyvage wvm gb last modified jul pm in another directory adjacent to bwf0dghldy5ob2x0qgdtywlslmnvbq theres subtitles directory which contains two files lfl4unyvage cc bytes and lfl4unyvage en cc kb both modified on the same day jul but earlier in the day at pm as you can see the wvm file is very large tried renaming its parent movies folder to movies2 to see if it broke anything and so far it doesnt seem to matter tried copying it to my mac but it says it is unable to copy the file yet it can copy the parent folders okay and dont currently have any movies that know of saved to my tablet either from the play store or copied over from my computer what does this file do and would it be safe to delete it and the associated subtitles to save space
27127 ive been happy owner of an acer iconia a500 for bit over year now but couple of weeks ago it started to complain about its internal memory being full was bit surprised as keep movies and such on the external sd card but assumed is was some browser cache maps or so which had eaten up fair chunk of the 32g memory it has internally however that doesnt seem to be the case have cleared the data of almost every single app have installed but still if look at the storage tab of the settings see the following couple of hours ago get the feeling that the rightmost grey part of the bar should be bit more than 379mbthe available part sd card at the bottom of the picture is the external one never mind that one ive tried almost every disk usage app available out there and they all show similar results the following is diskview picture taken after removed few apps in this picture sd card is the internal one one thing all the disk usage apps seems to have in common is that unless the device is rooted they cannot see what is in some directories like data which makes me think it is either android itself on this device which has some kind of cache which is misbehaving or that some process is producing extreme amounts of logs somewhere sorry for this long intro but the basic question is how do proceed guess one alternative is to find what is worth backing up and do factory reset or something but wold really like to find out what happened first rooting it is an alternative which would probably help me find out more but sort of like it as it is except for this issue if it is needed to resolve it could of course do it but it feels like you shouldnt have to with an appliance like this is there another way forward have this naive hope that there is button somewhere havent seen that clears all logs or reduce the log level from debug to info edit one thing ive been considering but cannot investigate is if it could be cores ive had lot of crashes lately presumably because it has been running low on disk in response to izzys comment below apps adds up to more or less exactly the 700mb listed as apps seems to be the total of data and the apps themselves

27277 have lg optimus one p500 for sometime am wondering why my phones battery has four terminals am aware that two terminals are for the positive and negative points and the the third connects to the batterys internal thermistor to monitor its temperature still that leaves me puzzled with what the fourth terminal could be for interestingly my phone has only three terminal where as the battery has four have searched for answers in google but no useful results other than description about temperature monitoring comes up also since another doubt also lies in the same image what is the port that is marked as in the following image it appears to me as some sort connector and my guess is that it is connector to cable with which manufacturers can access something deep in hardware the nokia phones which had also had this feature and guess this should be common for all phone then update am more keen on knowing what the fourth terminal on the battery does rather than why there are three in phone and four in battery as axeman said this battery could be used in other phones of lg as well

28296 know im asking for the close to impossible as real full backup certainly requires root permissions but still there are many folks around not wanting to root their devices afraid of voiding their warranties or bricking their devices or just not having their devices supported by any rooting method also know there were lot of questions asked already on this topic and checked all of them having the backup tag none covers the entire topic all just have pieces and especially people new to android but other non power users as well would have hard time figuring out the best way so want detailed canonical answer to the question not involving root solutions how to achieve backup as close as possible to full backup please do not give simple one liner answers like use app xyz full stop if mentioning an app and doubt single app would be the answer here include what parts are covered by it as well as ideas on how to fill the gaps it leaves and to make it absolutely clear know the first thing coming to mind is titanium backup use it myself but this does not apply here this question is strictly about methods for non rooted devices moreover the answer should be as generic as possible in terms of applying to wide range of devices it should not be restricted to one device or manufacturer already mentioned having investigated all questions here tagged backup these will certainly be helpful providing details for answers here so will list up the topmost ones concerning my question how to backup an android device how do perform full pre rooting backup of an android phone what info does google backup how can data on an unrooted phone be backed up could non root android smartphones rom be backup how do back up and restore my phone before installing custom rom backup my android without my apps settings configs etc all these provide some details for my question so feel free to get inspired by them but feel there are still details missing also it would be helpful to have summary say an answer including the full description of the maximum possible last criterium while id consider cloud based solutions legit id favour local solutions if you can provide both all the better but some people value privacy quite high im one of them and thus would not trust their data to some cloud service thanks to ryan we now have solution for really complete backup of all apps and their data which didnt dare to hope for the only disadvantage his solution only works for less than of all android users namely those whose devices are running at least with android so again ask the close to impossible any solutions applicable at least on gingerbread or better even froyo so they cover the majority of current devices these solutions may involve multiple tools try to keep it as simple as possible though think of your mother to follow your instructions and keep in mind no root to further motivate high quality answers and hopefully avoid low quality ones will be harsh one here as rarely do will down vote answers not fitting the mentioned criteria on one end but on the other end will setup bounty for the best answer which cannot be done immediately but earliest after days

30136 have rooted lg p500 optimus one running stock recently updated to unofficial cm10 android and observed few serious issues observed that googles my location service was not working many apps like my tracks endomondo etc which were compatible with other phones with were said incompatible all microphone related apps were not working after several hours of breaking my head understood that my system partition was absolutely full it had only 4kb of free space out of 190mb total capacity with my investigation found that few files were not copied to the system partition during the rom installation and gapps installation many troubles are the result of such missing files my questions system partition it is 190mb in total size who or how it was fixed as 190mb can the size of partition be increased tried tool but did not help after all the process completed without any errors still see no change in the size are there any other ways to do it hephappy rom developer had commented in xda page as no space p500 has 190mb for system partition and hence he withdraws the plan of developing jb rom for p500 is it then hardware limitation after all these issues switched back to my stock and still see my system partition as 190mb but with lot of free space does this mean that 190mb is sort of hardware size limitation if it is so then this would be one of the serious factors that are to be considered while buying the phone as the hardware in other means can accommodate the needs of jb except the system partition size which is real shame update few screenshots carrying frequently asked info taken in cm10 rom free internal storage 47mb system partition size 190mb ext2 partition on sd card created to create symbol link for few apps that cant be moved to sd card

34969 guess most of you at least have heard about wakelocks many of you will have experienced them already wether knowingly or not some may know how to deal with them in general but only few know how to deal with the more complicated candidates for those who dont know though above link leads to an explanation short summary apps may request wake lock to keep device component from sleeping so they can perform task even when the display is turned off this is very useful in most cases keeping the screen on while navigating keeping wifi active to stream music but used in the wrong way it causes your battery to be drained within short term up to per hour most times it is easy to identify the source usually bad behaving app will show this in an answer below as it might prove helpful to many users but what to do if the app which requested the wakelock exits without releasing it the android system will not take care of it sure reboot would solve the issue but it is not always an desired option so from users perspective im not asking about development solutions but how user can handle things what can be done by the user to solve the issue and avoid further battery drain prefer answers not involving root so all users can benefit from it however rooted solutions are fully valid and welcome as well
35093 ive got nexus on os version that suddenly started to drain its battery very quickly when looking in the battery usage see mediaserver eating of the battery over time with several minutes of cpu time logged and several hours of keep awake time typically the screen phone idle or other services eat up the majority of battery life tried closing all apps and charging it up and sure enough overnight it still drained significant battery again mediaserver was the culprit as reported in the battery usage chart it had kept the device awake all night and drained of my battery despite zero use havent added large number of files and im not playing music etc so mediaserver shouldnt be doing very much on the drive how can stop mediaserver from eating my battery life like this
35313 ive had my galaxy s3 for few months now and have always been able to connect to my pc via usb few days ago it suddenly stopped working ive found many other android se threads but none have been able to answer my question symptoms when plug the phone in via usb the phone beeps get lightning bolt on my battery but thats it there are no usb options in the pull down status bar and the pc does not recognize that device has been plugged in click screenshot for full size pc system windows x64 with the latest drivers and kies software from samsung phone info samsung sgh i747 android version baseband version i747uclg1 kernel version user build number imm76d i747ucalg1 what ive tried my wife has an identical galaxy s3 plugged her s3 into the same cable and it was recognized immediately so know the pc and cable are both working correctly uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers several times anyway alone and with the kies software every usb port on the box factory data reset both from the setup menu and the diagnostic bootup menu usb debugging mode both on and off changing the uart and usb settings in the phoneutil after my last factory reset its set to pda mtp adb anything else should try is there way to determine if the usb plug on the phone is bad edit screenshot from my wifes phone using the same computer same cable

35499 was wondering if have an app that is available on the play store is it safe to provide direct download of the apk file to someone either signed with the proper keys or just debug version safe in the sense of does the marketplace do anything special to the apk to protect the source code signing keys etc reason ask is user of my app has said that their marketplace play store is no longer working and therefore can not upgrade the app so asked me to email them the apk file the app is free app so on the surface cant see any issues though just wanted to double check although this raises the question the apks of the apps you download from the marketplace paid and unpaid are on your phone are these apks on the phone somehow unique to the phone google account otherwise what stops one from buying an app and passing that apk on to others
35580 recently bought nexus and would like to transfer my photos of my previous device to it my previous android phone used the standard usb mass storage which gave problems to copy back and forth stuff but the nexus like many other modern android phones suppose uses mtp instead which has the interesting feature of refusing to copy the original dates timestamps of the files using instead the date at which the files are being copied this is obviously huge bummer when it comes to photos not only because one cannot check the original date at which the picture was taken while browsing on the phone but also because they end up completely unsorted is there way to transfer photos to jelly bean android phone that doesnt support usb mass storage preserving the original timestamps things ive tried so far transferring via usb mtp adb push both full folders and individual files transferring via ssh using sshdroid winscp uploading and downloading from dropbox transferring zip file via mtp and uncompress the file on the phone transferring from the other phone via bluetooth quickpic fix date function local sync photo date correction ftpsyncx smoke signals yelling at the phone none of them preserved the timestamp and this is driving me insane also am not rooted yet but if the only viable way requires root would welcome that answer as well

35658 need to run configure file into my android phone so think the best way to do this is to use the adb shell command im running an android emulator onto windows platform and there im running the adb shell command into dos window using the cd command im changing to the directory where my configure file is and then im executing the following command configure im getting the following error configure permission denied so try to run adb in root mode with adb root but apparently my adb is already in root mode moreover have the character before each line of my adb shell have also tried to use chmod but dont see any difference before and after executing this command ls la so maybe the problem is here how can run the chmod command maybe someone here can help me with my issue and if you have also an explanation about why dont have the permission to run my configure file it will be great thanks ps my goal here is to use the net snmp package on an android platform by compiling the sources of this project directly onto the platform

35847 have an android device which is running android or something like that my little brother decided to try and guess my lock screen pattern the other day and ended up locking me out have since been unable to log back in to the tablet using my google account details provided the correct login details however it says they are incorrect could this be connected to the fact have no internet connection have no internet connection as the device is wifi only and the wifi is currently turned off cannot turn it on as am locked out how can log back into my tablet without wiping the user data
35852 one of the nice features introduced in android jelly bean on tablet devices is the ability to create user accounts just like you do on desktop operating systems however as far as can see there doesnt seem to be log off option available anywhere that would result in stopping all processes initiated by user the only standard option in the multi user environments world can see is switching between user accounts in order to do that all need to do on my google nexus tablet is lock the screen and then unlock it by hitting the hardware on off button on the screen that shows up you can select what user account youd like to log in to this is quite important as am worried the processes started by other users might have an impact on the performance of the device

39499 im looking for way to send an email to myself as quickly as possible am using my inbox as todo list and sometimes even send emails to myself to add new items the optimal solution would be one where after single touch on homescreen and typing line of text like buy milk some app or service would automatically send an email to my address with subject equal to what typed wish to avoid choosing destination address being forced to type something into the body and so on im currently using evernote for that occasionally moving items to my inbox manually but even then its or touches several seconds needed to load evernote on my bit dated milestone thanks for any ideas

39851 have an application running on rooted no name android tablet running ics that controls usb device via the usb host mode interface the android hardware usb host xml file is present in system etc permissions and everything works wonderfully except when run the app for the first time following reboot and then plug in the usb device get popup window saying allow the app appname to access the usb device use by default for this usb device cancel ok and have to tap ok before it can start using the device need to turn off the user confirmation so that the app can use the device straight away how do do this ive seem some suggestions about using keypress generator to simulate the user tapping the button on the screen but id prefer to avoid that sort of approach and set things up so that the confirmation request simply doesnt happen probably cant get the supplier to do custom kernel build for me but should be able to get the firmware signing key from them so can sign my app as system app if that will help one associated problem ticking the use by default for this usb device box doesnt appear to help if unplug and replug the device then get the confirmation prompt again have noticed in this situation that the device number in dev bus usb changes each time unplug and replug etc which perhaps explains this particular problemette

40934 since nice wacom tablet is bit pricey especially for someone like me who doesnt do much graphic editing was wondering if it is possible to use tablet my nexus as wacom esque drawing tablet when connected to linux computer did bit of searching however most of the info found is for using wacom tablet on an android device ive never used wacom device however have been doing some graphic editing in gimp and think it would be much easier than just using mouse and since have nexus it seemed like the logical place to start would have to use the nexus as usb peripheral for the computer and dont know if it is possible to transmit the touch screen coordinates to the pc if anyone can point me in the right direction id appreciate it

42129 have read that each android applications runs on different dalvik vm process all forked from zygote also read that these vms are really lightweight and use copy on write buffers and all that so far so good but also read that this was not done for security reasons isolation in fact dalvik vm should not be considered security boundary says google so my question is this why each process has to run on different vm
42245 it is nothing new that one can use multiple android devices with single google account switching on new device for the first time asks whether one wants to store ones data with google which then would always sync some stuff to the google servers basically some application data if the apps support it explicitly wi fi passwords browser bookmarks list of the apps installed from google play words added to the dictionary used by the onscreen keyboard most of your customized settings details might be found in the google dashboard relevant questions here covering those issues include what info does google backup what exactly is synced with google how does android sync the wifi profiles the developers api on google backup gives some further insight on how the backup stuff is supposed to work and several questions here show how it really works that is sometimes it does sometimes only partly and sometimes not at all aside from reliability and the fact that not everybody wants his private data in the cloud and even mentioned api reference2 warns android makes no guarantees about the security of your data while using backup you should always be cautious about using backup to store sensitive data such as usernames and passwords my main question is having backed up data from multiple devices using the same account what would happen to factory reset device being used that way before would it be recognized and have only those things restored which have been used on it before device identification could take place via imei but not via the android id as that might be gone with factory reset and this could be the reason for the behaviour described in nalums answer what would be restored to new factory reset device you just initialize for the first time with this google account if devices would be identified with backups in the google account used this could trigger special action for new device restore all device changed or restore all from the no longer connected device as it was probably replaced but stick to restore only what was on that device in case of factory reset the deal is if one has multiple devices they are often used for specific issues so one does not want everything on all devices as ive seen no way to chose which data to backup to exclude those sensitive data we have been warned about wifi passwords would belong to that category assume theres no choice on restore either so how is this handled
42347 can someone tell me how to change the country preference for google play have searched high and low but in most of the forums people ask you to go to gmail settings edit profile and change the country there but there is no place to change the country in settings there is something called place which can be marked as current but that has no impact on google play dont want to circumvent country restrictions want to permanently change the country so its not duplicate of how can circumvent regional restrictions in googles play store
42474 when it comes to troubleshooting often read recommendations like use adb logcat to find some more details looking for good way to backup all my apps including their data full backup of non rooted devices refers to adb backup and adb restore in several places one can find ways to remotely do on an android device with the use of adb such as transferring files using adb push or adb pull accessing the command line via adb shell and more so adb seems to be good thing to have for an android user but how to get this adb thingy on my computer not being developer installing the entire android sdk seems bit overkill is there more minimalistic approach available
42642 id like to be able to easily transfer large files wirelessly fast between android devices preferably without requiring root as secondary objetive it wouldnt hurt if the same solution could be used to transfer files between the android devices and windows pc specifically im trying to exchange files between my nexus android and samsung galaxy s2 android bluetooth is simply too slow so thats out of the question transfer via the internet is also not an option hence so is cloud based solutions only nexus supports nfc so thats out too fast file transfer looked promising and very simple but does not work on devices that dont have wifi tethering setting such as the nexus wi fi direct supported from android and up seems to be decent lowest common denominator between my two devices however galaxys s2s native send via wi fi direct sees the nexus but seems to get stuck in the connecting most times when there finally seems to be breakthrough get waiting and spinning circle even if it worked it would only allow me to send from the galaxy s2 to the nexus as similar option os not present on the nexus j4velins wifi direct is no longer available in the play store with the following explanation wifi direct drivers are broken on many devices which led to users leaving negative reviews for this app as dont see any sense in keeping free app published when only getting star ratings for an issue which only your device manufacturer can fix the app is no longer available at the play store nick adams wifi direct file transfer seems flaky at best invations from nexus to galaxy s2 are never received invitations from galaxy s2 are mostly received but even when accepting promptly the peers doesnt always show as connected when they finally do usually after quite long wait can select file to send but its never transferred transfer failed it says almost immediately in the notification bar budius incs wifi shoot is working slightly better but still very unreliable actually managed to occasionally send files both ways but never when attempting connection from the nexus to send from the nexus to the galaxy s2 had to go through this akward manoeuvre share the file on the nexus via the wifi shoot intent start the receive wifi shoot app on the galaxy s2 invite the nexus from the galaxy s2 never the other way around accept the invitation on the nexus press the shoot button on the galaxy s2 take the whole switching back and forth between devices and garnish with random delays or failures in any step of the process is there really no easy reliable fast way to transfer files directly between different android devices generally my experience with wi fi direct is all but positive device often wont even see device lying next to it sometimes it will see the other device only to have it disappear from the list before have the chance to connect when do have chance invations are not realiably received from galaxy s2 to nexus mostly reliable but never worked the other way around when invitations are received and accepted partnership rarely manages to be setup invited or connecting and even when that happens some apps cant seem to transfer files through it sigh maybe j4velins explanation pretty much sums up the sad state of wi fi direct on android which otherwise seemed as the best solution to my quest

42749 google keep on android seems to convert arbitrary numeric data into clickable phone numbers any sequence of or more digits with differing punctuation seems to trigger it seem to have triggered this lot so far and not once have actually typed phone number this is proving to be quite problematic the hypertextd numbers are too easy to tap particularly when you are going back to edit that text which then transports you away to the dialer most annoying is there any way to prevent the app from doing this update installed the update to today but there is no change in this behaviour yet in fact cant see that anything has changed with this update possibly bug fixes guess but nothing new is listed in the official change log either however this over zealous hyperlinking of numbers is more prevalent than first thought the default text messaging app does it as well so guess they share common text element

53225 as this warns you should not enable swap on the wrong partition or you can destroy your phone ok before we go any further previous phones had partition layout where mmcblck0 was the sdcard external our phone uses mmcblck1 for the external sd this is important because if you use an app it may be preset to use mmcblck0 as swap partition using this setting will cause you to use your sbl2 or sbl3 as swap partition this will brick your phone and unbrick guide will be useles so the swap partition might be dev block mmcblk0p3 if have partitions fat32 sdext swap on my sd card or dev block mmcblk0p2 if have partitions fat43 and swap or dev block mmcblk1p if you have different phone etc and the wrong choice can brick your phone how do you find out which partition is which it should be the only partition on any drive of the phone with the swap filesystem fdisk does this on ubuntu but outputs nothing in android blkid does not show the swap partition cat proc partitions lists lot of partitions but doesnt indicate which is the swap cat proc swaps only lists swaps that are already being used cat proc mtd only says dev size erasesize name and nothing else ls dev block vold lists some partitions as but doesnt indicate what they are 4ext recovery will show it in the table of partitions swap swap mib but doesnt say the dev name even if theres no command line tool to print it directly surely theres way to deduce it from some other information

62210 unlocking the bootloader and or the recovery is very popular discussion across many devices but doing so exposes very obvious and inevitable issue with security an unlocked recovery means that no matter how secure you make your android lock screen someone can easily reset phone to restore the phone to fully functional and lockless insecure state and the worst part they dont have to erase your datameaning they can access all your personal files and folders it is almost hilarious in fact if the phone supports insertion of external sd cards you can even flash your own software into the phone and maybe bypass the lock screen without wiping any data for example one possible loophole is using the tasker app which has feature that can temporarily disable the keyguard and the best part is that tasker can be flashed using the recovery so is there any method by which could add security measure that prevents complete access to my recovery and or boot loader that will make my phone less insecure expected answer method by which custom pin password must be entered before entering the bootloader recovery so that my bootloader recovery is still technically unlocked but simply requires authentication to use this also ensures that conventional unlocking methods wont work as the phone is not really locked this also means that one does not have to lose root access to ensure security
62387 enabled developer options on my samsung galaxy grand duos and then changed limit background process option from standard limit to no background process after that my phone is working fine with no hanging problems or no slowness as before but my doubt is will this change affect any process updates applications or anything which might cause an error or failure

63170 my galaxy s2 has recently died completely over night it does not turn on regardless of which combination of buttons try and how long press them ive tried with two different batteries without battery sim no sim and so on it still seems to recharge the battery as it builds up heat when connected to charger in the top left corner below the display side camera since im certain it is beyond repair ive ordered new phone and am now thinking about how to get to the stuff that was not on the sd card of the broken one which neglected to backup for few month ive been thinking about removing the memory device physically no harm done if break anything else as consider it broken already anyway unfortunately there are hardly any resources on the internet that was able to find in that regard so my question is simple where is the internal memory in the s2 and how can rip it out dont care if break any other components as long as get to that memory device
63630 am used to install and remove various operating systems in my pcs even having several at time usually to install new os means burn the iso to cd dvd usb insert it boot maybe you have to tweak bit the bios first the only difference between pcs is its cpu architecture x86 x86 arm etc depending on that you have to download one iso or another but never have to worry about which graphic card mouse keyboard screen network card etc it has the install wizard automatically detects that and installs the corresponding drivers sometimes if they are not bundled the installer also downloads them anyway the key point here is that the iso is always the same now many mobile os come out ubuntu tizen firefox os the omnipresent android and why not any linux arm distro out there sadly have random chinese mobile that surely will never get official support in any platform and will never be able to test them but are not todays phones just tiny arm pcs why is installation that different why do always need to have precompiled monolithic rom specific for my phone model why not just single iso per os for any phone that detects and installs automatically the needed drivers just like always has been in the pc market note understand the problem with privative drivers but remember debian asking me for those when there were no libre alternatives at installation and could install them then or later suppose that workaround could be used in those cases too correct me if im wrong

65557 is there technical reason why android phones general lag lot behind the stable released version of android this applies to both new phones for example recent trip to the phone shop everything was to kitkat could not be seen and also old phones my girlfriends iphone had an ota update to the latest os this is july phone whilst july android is basically paperweight presumably android itself doesnt concern itself with the actual hardware and thus talks to the os via abstractions guess then the handset maker just provides the drivers for the specific hardware thus cant see the issue with pushing ota updates if the abi remains stable my phone doesnt grow new hardware features
65922 just found out that some apps that uninstall from my tablet are still listed in all apps section by my device although marked as not installed apps list click image for larger variant how can fully remove them please note that those are not system apps or pre installed apps by manufacturer
66192 have noob question im planning to buy an android phone which doesnt include sdcard slot only internal memory am now using htc desire which include sdcard slot change rom on my phone so often what im worried about is will formatting data before flashing rom going to remove all data in internal memory as the one im planning to buy rely only on internal memory or does htc make some partition for something like virtual sdcard space that is stay untouched even wiping data from recovery
66250 have galaxy nexus running if it matters but id presume the rules would apply to most android os in general it isnt currently rooted but can root it if necessary that ive recently replaced with newer phone now id like to give my year old my gnex as basic game kids app device that he can mess around with since he was used to playing few kid games before on it still want wifi access so airplane mode is out however id like to be able to completely remove the phone functionality from the phone the phone has no service but can still make emergency calls and im concerned about him possibly doing so before can explain to that it was an accidental call so is there way to completely disable the phone dialer the ability to place emergency calls the contacts address book bottom line if you think in apple terms id like an iphone to become an ipod touch but for my android
67121 im really confused about android memory management just read here that killing apps by swiping from recent list or using task killers wont save your battery but drain more because this cause the os to load the apps all over again next time you launch it or startup by themselves they also said the actually thing we should worry is cpu usage not ram usage is that mean using too much ram doesnt drain battery as ram is hardware holding something on it shouldnt drain battery what if was playing temple run and just press home button so the app will load faster next time launch or should we just press back button until the app exit as we always do ive also searched the internet but some said it would drain battery as it sits on ram some said there is no difference between ram holds actual data or nothing should we let go of our app killing habit and just feel relax some precise answers would be greatly appreciated thanks
67157 the heartbleed vulnerability in particular versions of openssl is serious security issue which allows malicious servers or clients to undetectably obtain unauthorized data from the other end of an ssl tls connection my android device has copy of openssl installed in system lib its version number is 1c which appears to make it vulnerable to this attack shell vanquish grep openssl system lib libssl so openssl 1c may how does this affect me do android apps use openssl if not why is it there can expect firmware update from my carrier if root my phone can update it myself
67237 ive got multiple android devices and have plethora of apps ive just done factory reset on one in order to use it for development purposes only however there are couple of apps that need that ive already paid for if attach my google account to this device by default the device will begin downloading all of my apps and while this is good feature for some dont want all that crap on this device how can prevent my device from automatically downloading apps when attach my play account

68611 firefox removed the ability to send tab to remote device namely you could send share intent from any other app select share select firefox select any other firefox sync device you want to send the tab to and few seconds to minutes later it would appear in your desktop firefox as new tab that was my main use of firefox on android how do get exactly that back that is want send tabs from an android share intent to firefox on the desktop not the other way do have foxtophone but hardly ever use it it should be one click operation dont want to copy paste urls dont even need target device selection although would be okay with the two click operation required in firefox because always want to send to the same device this should work even when the android device is offline plane in which case the tabs should simply be queued and sent when the network comes back thats exactly what firefox did the use case is everything spot on mobile from emails interesting stuff while browsing reading articles on pocket etc but that maybe doesnt work on mobile flash requires more screen estate or just requires some kind of action from me which dont want to perform on mobile

72855 ive noticed quite few apps requesting the receive sms permission two things are clear to me here receive sms enables an app to snap incoming sms read sms just applies to sms already stored as some of the apps just were asking for receive sms but not for read sms got curious this seems to imply receive sms is not only targeted at the receiving part but the app can also do what it wants with the received message read it then throw it away silently so the user doesnt even notice there was an sms which might be the way tan trojans act to snap identifiers for online banking transactions but would it also be possible for such an app to intercept the message receive it read it and process its content in any way forwarding it by other means such as via ip and then pass it on as if nothing had happened in other words can it spy on the user this way

74618 as with the latest update to google play one now longer sees the full list of permissions requested by an app on install update1 feel my privacy invaded even worse an app could sneak in additional permissions with an update and without the user knowing23 so im looking towards alternatives tl dr know weve got what are the alternative android app markets but thats more or less listing of other markets without giving backgrounds4 and its not even mentioning aptoide dont want another app that has to run in background permanently to check license validity so things like the amazon appstore or androidpit are out appbrain is just another front end to google play so nice as it is it doesnt solve the issue as for app installs and updates it just has to re direct to google play which im rather about to flee ive already checked out droid few days ago and feel it pretty fitting my needs follow the link for details but with just about apps as of it leaves too many gaps aptoide on the other end is said to serve more than apps currently as the name suggests it uses apt style repositories which im used to from linux debian and derivates it even lets you have your own private repo to share apps between devices or with friends all apps are offered for free so no need for license server but how safe is it for the end user ive googled and ducked for hours but could not find any source on this instead found lot of links of the type get paid apps for free black market and other piracy oriented stuff which is definitely not what im after im more than open to pay for good apps5 so getting them for free is not the intention behind my question like droid aptoide has multiple repositories but couldnt figure out whether theres trust able main repository like with droid there is related information available in the package description this one indicating safety measures such as malware scan signature validation and third party validation but as the corresponding web page shows this information seems to be at least partly relying on user feedback which could be faked manipulated or is not even presented to the user the package info names scanners used to check cannot find this info on the web page while might be able to look things up via package info cannot ask my years old parents to do so on this page aptoide also points out how to see results of their security measures and explicitly states aptoide anti malware platform analyses applications in run time and disables potential threats across all stores emphasis mine which suggests malware protection comparable to that of google play how does that go together with those black market rumors maybe they just dont remove offending apps but only mark them instead so finally the question is there way to safely use aptoide as source for apps if so how6 if not why not bonus points for an idiot proof way which could be recommended to less experienced users footnotes know it would be possible opening the google play store web page of the app scroll through it and click the corresponding link when found but you cant call that user friendly or expect users doing this on every update on first install it requested the unsuspecting read phone state with the usual justification with an update it could request call phone process outgoing calls and others and the play app would not bring that up as they belong to the same group to figure new permissions one had to compare those of the installed version with those of the present one have fun ive just edited two answers and added some details on appbrain and droid to fill those gaps ive bought lot of apps on google play or donated to the dev directly and droid has donation buttons on each apps page to make this possible could imagine by knowing and restricting your use to safe aptoide repositories this could be achieved but as wrote couldnt figure out which ones to consider safe the aptoide article on wikipedia suggests theres default repo on install and more repos need to be added manually so it might be sticking to that first one is safe
75360 got some huge games which dont play regularly but dont want to delete either is it possible to backup those apps as apk so that can install them offline later im not talking about backing up only the app data many tools exist for that purpose want the ability to install the app again offline at later time also this is not necessarily an app suggestion request any method to achieve this is ok with me

77423 heres something that want to do with my android phone galaxy s2 cm9 ill be happy if someone could tell me whether its possible and how often want to transfer files from my computer to my phone but its clunky process the easiest way for me right now is to use airdroid but its cumbersome connecting via usb is cumbersome too because need to enable the usb storage thing what really want is this want folder on my computer that can put files into and have them automatically uploaded to dedicated folder on my phones sd card without any further action on my part its important that this wont mean constantly having heavy program working in the background on my phone because its slow enough as it is any way to do that
79112 need to increase the size of my galaxy 2s system partition from 4mb to well anything possible the main reason why want to do this is because want to install gapps which is not compatible with devices with small under 500mb system partitions the galaxy 2s internal storage is 16gb but mostly use my sd card so dont really care how much of this will be taken to use in the system partition ive found lot of pages explaining different methods to achieve this like this one from techotv and this one from xda but all of them were phone specific and never gave the information if it would be compatible with other models or not or they would resize to specific set size theres also this question from android se but the answer werent satisfactory enough for me as the author limited himself to only say that it is possible but not saying how to add few more information the phone is rooted and with cyanogenmod nightly which is android it would be interesting if the information provided works under linux have access to windows but rather not have to use it arent there any simple way of resizing the partitions like gparted but for android

82313 for all have heard reducing the screen brightness of your phone can increase your battery life just about every expert in the field agrees to this statement but today came across this article which kind of raised quite few questions in my mind the excerpt from the article in question here is all these screen dimming color cast applications function in essentially the same way by overlaying graphic on the screen to reduce the brightness and or change the color cast of the screen think of it like adding partially opaque layer to an image in photoshop when you tell the lux application for example that you want the screen percent dimmer than the actual hardware in the phone can provide via led adjustments the application essentially cheats by layering gray mask over the screen that decreases the brightness because the screen elements are darker other apps like screen adjuster darker easy eye twilight and even the brightness adjustment function in popular battery saving app juicedefender all work the same way so if the screen brightness applications like lux only add partially opaque layer they are essentially not dimming the backlight correct me if am wrong here so in turn it would not have any affect in battery life right the article continues saying anything that layers something over the screen in anyway disables the install button as the button is rendered unclickable in order to prevent malicious software from creating false overlay that leads the user to think an application has different set of permissions or that the application is an entirely different app altogether so does reducing the screen brightness via settings uses some other technique probably it actually reduces the backlight
82339 accidentally started downloading mb file from google chrome and cant find the option to stop it the downloads app just shows the files that have already finished but not the downloads in progress the notification on my top bar just opens the downloads app
85290 found directory on the sd card of my nexus called d1o1m0o7b1i1le that definitely wasnt there last week it contains directory called dont remove which contains bunch more directories with random names each containing folders image thumb and video all empty havent installed anything new that know of and this directory just feels sketchy so im concerned that it might be virus but havent been able to find many other references to it on the internet xda has nothing but google shows two pastebin results that look like process dumps have been doing some basic development lately but would think there would be more references to it if it were part of android ive just downloaded avast mobile and scanned everything but it doesnt seem to have turned up anything other than few settings im running the android developer preview rooted so theres definitely more opportunities for compromise on my device than most anyone know what virus might have and if so how can get rid of it or if this is just something normal should ignore
86920 few months back rooted my nexus using towelroot installed twrp and elementx kernel now as the android lollipop update is around the corner dont think ill be able to install ota update because of rooted phone and custom recovery in some forums even read that it might mess up my phone so now want to know what is the safest way to get the official android lollipop update dont mind losing root custom kernel and all that even searched going all stock but that seems like cumbersome solution with many risks one easy way was thinking of is downloading the android lollipop system image tgz file when google uploads it and flashing that into my phone using twrp however dont know how and cant find anything about how to flash tgz file can do it by placing it in the memory booting into recovery install androildl tgz will that do it if yes then what changes will it make will my custom kernel and root be gone or not thank you

87410 want to know if its possible to get disk image of the storage space on android devices when they dont use external storage like sd cards im mostly interested because my kids factory reset my kindle fire hdx and was hoping could get disk image using something like dd in linux and then try to recover some of the user data like photos and videos using something like photorec http www cgsecurity org wiki photorec ive done this lots of times with sd cards and hard disks by simply mounting the storage device in desktop running debian and executing something like dd if dev sdb1 of image iso then you can use photorec and or testdisk depending on what you want to get useful stuff out of the image file even some of my very old android devices seem to allow mounting storage device in this way without removing sd card from the phone and following this process unfortunately it looks like many new devices that dont have removable storage like my kindle fire hdx and my nexus only allow you to interface with computer using media transfer protocol mtp and picture transfer protocol ptp can use these protocols to get bit by bit copy of the storage in the device is there way to add the older storage device capabilities to new phones
87897 recently flashed my nexus to android lollipop using the factory image have set pattern lock for unlocking the device but whenever turn on the phone have to click on the little lock icon or swipe upwards to bring up the pattern unlocker dots in kitkat or earlier versions those dots would come up as soon as turn on the phone is there any way to set the pattern dots visible on lock screen by default went through all the settings but in vain

88120 the google calendar app recently updated to the new material design look ive noticed that notifications have changed in way that do not like when calendar event comes due it appears as notification in the notifications bar at the top of the screen in the past it stayed there for about or hours not sure exactly but it was well over hours as long as did not mess with it but now it seems to only stick around for very short amount of time as long as the event is ongoing think in other words it seems that once an event is over the notification disappears this is not good news for me used calendar events as reminders to get things done ex take out the trash on wed night would always see this in the evening and can put it off until later in the evening if need be worst case when go to bed would see the notification still sticking around and then go put the trash out im looking for way to get the previous functionality is there trick for this im also open to trying free calendar or task apps that do this suggestions please running android on nexus

89622 because do not want to consent to the google location services privacy agreement have this switched off by doing so know some location functionality like cell based and wifi based location will not be functional however would expect simple gps functionality to work in normal way functioning in normal way to me would be to use gps data if available else use the last known location historically this is how gps receivers work the current am running android lollipop implementation from google however seems to not give any location at all when there is no clear fix throwing me lots of warnings and placing me all over the world instead of in my home location my question does anyone know third party location provider spoofer which simply caches my last known location if there is no gps fix just giving me back normal functionality additional functionality which would be very welcome is caching wifi cell data so if have been somewhere it will remember without gps fix any suggestions would greatly be appreciated
89737 on pc there are hard disks acting as storage space where the operating system and application files are stored and there is ram which is memory which gets used up by the operating system executable code and applications executable code while everything is running on my samsung galaxy siii when go to settings more storage there are various sections which talk about storage space and memory as though these were the same thing so here come my questions apart from storage space provided by the optional sd card which must be inserted into the back of the phone next to the sim card is there single memory chip acting as both storage medium for files when the device is turned off as well as random access memory for the running operating system executables and apps in execution as the following screenshot reports there seem to be 00gb on my device used both as hard disk and as ram is this how this storage medium works single chip for both where can see the amount of space available on my sim card according to wikipedia such space can only be used to store specific kinds of data such as network specific information maximum of contacts except for newer models where each contact can only consist of name and single phone number pair and sms messages sim card capacities are also limited to 32kb to 128kb or more but in any case its very small amount of space it could be that because of these limitations the samsung galaxy siii and other modern android phones do not make use of this space for user data but correct me if im wrong thank you for your replies
90141 im looking for possibility to retrieve both the package names and the common names of apps installed on an android device via adb or at least to retrieve the common name if the package name is known quick search on our site brought up two related questions but they dont solve my issue how do get the common name of an app having the package name like com android blabla command line or included app doesnt work via adb but uses an app youve got to lookup with manually matching the request of the op how to find app based on package name just reverts to an url lookup at google play which doesnt always fit as not all apps are available there im looking for way to retrieve the information directly from the device if possible not any way including web lookups or via an app as those two questions have it know there are multiple tools available to obtain package details adb dumpsys package while this lists all packages with bunch of details the common name is not shown adb shell pm list only gives the package names aapt would be able to obtain the common name but would require to first pull the apk file from the device which is not really convenient and obviously will be pretty slow with many and or large apps installed did miss something know the information must be on the device how else could it show the app names in the gui doubt android parses the apk file each time the gui need the common name so is there way to get hold of it using adb directly tl dr background if somebodys curious want to be able to quickly obtain list of user apps from any of my devices without having to revert to acrobatics list of their package names can retrieve using adb shell pm list but as those are package names only recognizing apps is guess work so if there were some adb command to retrieve the common name for given package name could simply use loop like for pkg in adb shell pm list do echo adb whatever the command is pkg pkg done and get listing of all the installed user apps in human readable format together with their package names use cases see what superflous apps are installed which could remove cross check lists from multiple devices documentation and probably more but the above are what need it for
90152 im using the geotracker application to record position and velocity as exercise along track live on relatively flat ground only shift up and down no more than5 meters at the very maximum but while latitude and longitude readings seem quite precise the program which uses gps and imho does not use the pressure sensors barometer to determine altitude reports the difference between maximum and minimum altitude along the track to be about 50m this is quite inaccurate it seems why is this thanks

104585 know that google play applications cannot do anything that is not spelled out in their androidmanifest xml and will be blocked from doing so want to know if non google play applications are locked down with the same security measure will android tell me what permissions they require before installation and block functions that use permissions not noted in the manifest of non google play apps because google says in the event that an application attempts to use protected feature which has not been declared in the applications manifest the permission failure will typically result in security exception being thrown back to the application protected api permission checks are enforced at the lowest possible level to prevent circumvention an example of the user messaging when an application is installed while requesting access to protected apis is shown in figure does this apply to non google play apps

109833 have samsung galaxy s6 edge 64gb running android lollipop which ive had since release day april 10th and as the title mentions there seems to be an issue in that my images are no longer displaying in the default gallery app also have quite lot of music on the phone which doesnt display in the music player anymore im not sure what causes the photos and music to disappear as it seems to be totally random can still see the files in the default file manager my files the first time it happened thought that it may have been glitch so did factory reset and everything was fine again although it does take about hours for me to get the phone just how like it it then happened second time few days later and so did another factory reset when it happened the third time was getting pretty annoyed and took it to my local samsung repair centre where they said it was software problem and they would have to reinstall android and it would be sorted however days later it happened again so went back to carphone warehouse where purchased the contract from and demanded new phone as it had to be an issue with the phone as couldnt find record of it happening to anyone else and samsung had already eliminated software problem now weeks after got new phone it has happened again the images were there this morning and come this evening they have all disappeared from the gallery and again the music has disappeared ive done nothing out of the ordinary with my phone today so cannot identify what has happened if take new pictures on the camera they appear in the gallery fine but the old ones do not if look in my files can see that the old images are in the exact same location as the new photo that ive just taken its almost like they are hidden from the gallery if install an app such as quickpic all the images are displayed in there both new and old however cannot use this for sharing images to facebook etc so its not ideal the same applies to the music files that have if look in my files can see them but they do not appear in music player which means that all my alarm tones have been set back to their default tracks morning flower the screenshots below shows all the images that are currently in the camera folder where only the top one appears in the gallery and only the top one is in the images category in my files ive had play around with all sorts of settings cleared the cache partition clicked show hidden files in my files and rebooted the phone several times but there still seems to be an issue ive also deleted the media data from the media storage app which emptied my gallery but on reboot didnt do rescan or at least didnt get any results as its an s6 edge there is no sd card so it shouldnt be an issue with mounting the disk although it wouldnt make sense since the new files are in the same location as the old ones ive managed to find couple of people with similar issue on ae but theyve not had response see here and here is there some sort of debug log that can create and upload to somewhere could it be specific combination of apps that ive got since there are minimal people with the same issue id be grateful for any ideas as its driving me insane thanks in advance adam edit ive linked up my phone to the computer and run adb logcat but the log is huge and im not sure what im looking for the following error appears fairly frequently mediascannerser binder transaction failed size if there is specific bit in the log that would be helpful please let me know and ill do my best to extract it edit is there procedure that can follow to create bug report that can then send to google or samsung

116473 there appears to be giant security vulnerability with android that seems to basically affect all phones pc world wrote the vast majority of android phones can be hacked by sending them specially crafted multimedia message mms security researcher joshua drake has found drake found multiple vulnerabilities in core android component called stagefright that used to process play and record multimedia files some of the flaws allow for remote code execution and can be triggered when receiving an mms message downloading specially crafted video file through the browser or opening web page with embedded multimedia content the mms attack vector is the scariest of all because it doesn require any interaction from the user the phone just needs to receive malicious message for example the attacker could send the malicious mms when the victim is sleeping and the phone ringer is silenced drake said after exploitation the message can be deleted so the victim will never even know that his phone was hacked he said what can regular user do to mitigate the issue disable google hangouts

only system partition to the external sd card su dd if dev block platform msm sdcc by name system of storage microsd system img bs 1m ls storage microsd system img rw root root sep system img the size exactly 2gib was bit suspicious could it be that this was because of the fat32 partition on the sd card no it was not tune2fs revealed that this was indeed valid ext4 image exactly sized at 2gib which passed fsck with no errors at all and fastboot from the linux machine attached to the tablet concurred after an adb reboot bootloader linuxbox fastboot getvar all bootloader version bootloader

125121 my nexus screen met tragic end due to violent contact with flooring tiles everything works except the touchscreen which displays fine but does not react to touch any more would like to get full copy of my data partition but my device uses full disk encryption with lock pattern can easily get image files of my partitions from cwm recovery through adb adb pull dev block mmcblk0p23 userdata img which gives me nice 6gb file but mounting this image is another story since it is encrypted my pc uses xubuntu also have windows at hand if necessary but guess linux system is more useful here my phone is rooted know my unlock pattern of course so there should be some way to mount read my userdata img file any pointers thanks

129074 doze has been bringing great benefit for my aging nexus but sadly its presence also marks an end for my whatsapp web experience since their web app is actually just mere interface and still requires the phone to be actively connected to the internet as we all know doze puts ones phone into stand by state where every unnecessary connection is halted this means it will also halt the whatsapp app in my phone and thus in my computers browser now is there way to exclude whatsapp from doze mean is something like that possible prefer non rooted approach to this problem but should rooting be my only option so be it

136711 what versions of youtube for android definitively support fast forward and rewind im referring to the forwards and backwards buttons in landscape mode that permit you to jump seconds lost this feature after accidentally updating the youtube app and am seeking way to restore this functionality if can determine what versions support the feature then ill be able to sideload the correct version the only information ive been able to find on the subject references the introduction of the feature in ive tested and number of other versions to no avail perhaps the feature has been disabled server side does anyone have any first hand experience with version that includes this feature
137895 many people tell about fastboot that it can be used to flash image on one of the partitions is the reverse also possible that is take binary snapshot and store it as zip file containig the exact binary representation of the partition to be backuped the reason ask this is backup has two steps take and image snapshot to backuplocation backup and replacing image snapshop from backuplocaito restore to me it seems that fastboot is only doing one while being able to write to the androids internal flash in binary dd style seems it should also be able to read from the flash this way nobody would need to organize and run another potentially not trustworthy rom to do the reading job

139347 my phone is galaxy s3 not rooted have es file explorer and terminal emulator installed downloaded an android build of wget intending to execute it from the terminal emulator app the file currently exists in storage sdcard0 download which is an internal partition not physical sd card as rw rw root sdcard rw wget wget gives permission denied chmod wget gives bad mode this is apparently because androids chmod only accepts octal digits chmod wget gives operation not permitted can copy the file with cp so the filesystem is writable other as here give several possible reasons for chmod failing on android one is sd cards formatted with fat which do not support permission bits but as say this is not actually an sd card another is the filesystem being mounted with noexec my android linux knowledge is way too lacking to check such things is android blocking me from executing wget by design is there way to execute it without rooting my phone

141885 have previously nervously rooted phones ive owned samsung s2 s3 as wanted to be able to use adaway ad blocker effective not just in browsers adblocker but also in other apps say nervously because always found the mode in which these modified roms are offered websites such as xda developers bit dodgy flimsy nevertheless this has worked well in the past but am aware that might just have been lucky as those forums abound with bad experiences bricked phones or at the very least tons of wasted time trying to at least make your phone work again even in its stock let alone rooted firmware now have new phone the most expensive ive owned so far s7 edge and browsing these same websites again feel just as edgy performing this risky operation for instance the s7 edge section of the xda devs website has several rooted roms available however without spending hours and hours it is not obvious what the differences between them are to name just few doubts how are recovery firmwares different from ones just called kernel or rom in what way does each of those roms differ from the cyanogenmod which ive happily used in the past but for which there is no s7 edge version released from what can see incidentally used odin to install cyanogenmod on my old phones rather than recovery are there major differences in how the s7 edge will operate with such rooted firmware rom as compared to the stock one specifically will it be any more vulnerable to exploits etc given that no one can really tell whether these roms have built in trojans given all these concerns about android rooting is there any way that adblocking can be performed without rooting if not what is the least intrusive and least risky way to root an android in this case an s7 edge
143330 think my device got malware lock screen with ads sometimes appear and must swipe an area at the bottom of the screen to open the phone am in eastern europe some ads are in slavic languages and they are seemingly related to travel image resized click to view the full image have seen ads for lot air polish carrier recently went to their site considering my recent surfing activity and the nature of the ads guess the malware is connected to airlines active in eastern europe the lock screen also promotes the app du quick charger by claiming it has recharged the phone extra fast during screen off it also shows battery level have never installed du quick charger doubt du quick charger is installed on the phone the problem started after installing ryanair app the problem is maybe but not surely related to this uninstalling ryanair and restarting the phone doesnt remove the occasional appearance of this lock screen after while the situation has changed for the worse now this lock screen appears after every screen off have always used avast am not rooted and only install via google play what is this and how do remove it

144951 on facebooks mobile website on my sisters phone when you click the messages tab it first opens play store opened on messenger app or it opens messenger if its installed if you click back the messages page is properly displayed but if you click on conversation the same thing happens play store pops up but when you click back the proper conversation page is loaded in chrome phone moto 3rd gen android on my phone the mobile website in chrome works just fine theres button that suggests installing messenger but can normally browse and use messages phone oneplus android oxygenos is there any way to prevent the facebook website from trying to open the app certainly dont want to use any fb app details on what already tried installing and uninstalling messenger clearing defaults and clearing data for both chrome and messenger if you copy link to conversations page and open it in new tab it opens the page properly without jumping to play store so is it malicious script from facebook itself
145273 as saw yesterday google keynotes with an awesome release of many new features one of the best feature which like most as an android developer that is android instant apps the new android instant apps lets you access apps from anywhere without installing it will let you run android apps as seamlessly as loading web page and it is compatible all the way back to jelly bean have question in my mind that if it will be accessed without installing then will it be counted as installation on play store and if it wont then what is the meaning to use it from the developer side what will be the benefit to the developer dont oppose this feature just want to know how it will work
146291 was wondering how android applications and android implements the share button and share mechanism for instance when hit the share button on youtube list off apps to share to pops up how is this list determined is there specific share intent and then all spots capable of sharing the type of intent provided in the intent extras show up what is the technical name of the design pattern used to implement this thanks

152087 what are the technical differences between root based firewalls like afwall and non root based firewalls like netguard is there any impact on the security effectively provided by such software ive already checked bit in netguards source code to make myself an idea but think this may still be good question and im interested to get other peoples analysis on the subject would like to restrict such question to the core technical feature provided by such software like the kind of firewalling stateless or stateful are there any hardcoded exceptions the robustness of the code handling untrusted packets etc and not on secondary features or anti features they may have ads tracking cosmetic unless they concretely affect the core objective of the software in other words no rants please in case there are limitations it might be worth mentioning if they are implementation specific the consequence of some choice made by the development team or consequence of the technology used relying on very different systems it is possible that one has to cope with limitations that the other does not have

176501 laptops have usually at most four cores and dualcores are probably more common have recently switched from quadcore to dualcore and can confirm there is limited number of usecases for quadcore even with cpu intensive tasks on the other hands at mobile phones quadcores hexacores and octacores seem to be common why what tasks can utilize them understand that big little can be part of the answer that is the main benefit of so many cores is not the ability to use all of them simultaneously but rather using core with power consumption appropriate for the current workload however for example the snapdragon has eight cortex a53 cores which does not seem to be case for big little maybe the arm architecture has lower point of optimal performance per watt that is having single core tuned for optimal performance per watt results in lower performance on arm than on intel so more cores are used in order to deliver the performance this is just hypothesis but even in this case dont see what workload can efficiently use say eight cores on mobile phone on laptops can imagine few like full non incremental compilation of project but on phones games can be performance hungry but they usually require gpu performance rather than cpu dont they theoretically multiple cores could speed up android lollipop marshmallow aot compilation when installing or when upgrading the phase optimizing apps am however not sure if this can utilize multiple cores as far as remember the code only one app is being compiled at time but maybe there is some parallelism within the compilation process itself also android could utilize multiple cores when compiling but since it reportedly compiles when idle and charging the benefit seems to be rather minimal at least when one charges the phone overnight really dont care if it takes 30minutes or two hours in such scenario

189450 im roaming in mexico with an international plan via us based gsm carrier this gets me 4g on telcel in mexico and it works great however occasionally for reasons unknown to me sometimes my phone will switch off of telcel and switch to cell network named which does not provide cellular data this happens while browsing the internet on my phone while tethered to my laptop or while im asleep from quick search gather that is at ts imsi code but my us carrier is not at though this phone was never carrier locked is there an android setting that can modify to either stop my phone from changing cell networks automatically prohibit my phone from connection to specific cell network in this case tethering is explicitly included in my plan so dont think its telcel kicking me off when notice that my data connection is gone can switch back to telcel by selecting it via the cellular operators menu in settings my phone is motorola moto pure running android edit whoops the offending network is which is movistar
