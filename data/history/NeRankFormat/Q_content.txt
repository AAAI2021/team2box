219 there is dispute among historians over whether the roman empire collapsed because of its increasing size and system imminent flaws which were not suited for this size the bigger the territory the harder to govern it efficiently it is possible this factor could also be viewed in regards to todays large russia and very large companies where the communication lag within system increases this brought me to the question how was communication in the roman empire set up and did it exist in holistic way at all how were orders and information feedback from marginal regions transported or brought to important decision makers did the romans use horsemen runners carrier pigeons or form of postal service how reliable was this and on what time schedules did person to person exchange happen letter and reply letter can anyone here shed some light on this process and its limitations or implications for consistently increasing roman empire is it safe to assume it must have played an important role when analyzing the success and then the demise of the roman empire

235 know more about the american war of independence than about other british colonies but have begun to wonder why was it just america the british had colonies in other places but there doesnt seem to have been any rush to war for freedom as there was in america what made these colonies special in some respects ive thought of the following taxation with or without representation was motivating factor yet all colonies would have been taxed in some respect so dont see why this one was singled out unless the burden was placed more on the colonies here due to the protection needed in the wars for france the heterogenous nature of the colonies immigration had occurred from various countries though not in large amounts but even though many here were british they were not homogenous group that would maintain close link with the mother country the british would want to maintain colonies here that were profitable and would not want to lose them especially after protecting them from france see first point so they needed to money to pay down war debts there was that close connection to england that many maintained george washington was known to have many goods imported so if it was just an american identity that spawned here why not in other colonies at the time the carribean colonies were just as isolated and in some way heterogenous the indian and chinese colonies were in lands that were large and in period of time later became free of british influence but it was not from colonists are there any books or is there research on this subject at all

651 many african countries are currently in the bottom parts of socioeconomic rankings like gdp per capita life expectancy literacy hdi etc some of them possess decent amount of natural resources and relatively low population burden so this is disappointing are there historical reasons for this to have happened and yes know there are poor countries everywhere but there seems to be an unusually high concentration of them especially in the sub saharan region and before colonization is brought up as factor let me remind you the united states is former british colony
663 after period of maritime explorations see zheng he in the early 15th century the ming dynasty started shutting the middle kingdom out of the rest of the world this of course continued with the qing and the empire remained largely isolated until the 19th century because of foreign initiative however just when spain and portugal started flourishing with an economy based on trade the chinese chose to close their doors to the world why might have caused them to do this

732 it seems common position that monotheism tends to evolve out of polytheism wikipedia offers few historical examples of this however many polytheistic religions seem to have monotheistic overtones some native american mythology speaks of an universal and omniscient great spirit hinduism is said to be monotheistic by some accounts even though it appears to be polytheistic to the casual observer further some of the most famous polytheistic religions have different definition of god than the monotheistic religions do every monotheistic religion that am aware of there may be exceptions believe that their god is the creator of the world and all that inhabit it from this view point many gods in the famous polytheistic religions would be considered simply spirits possibly angels possibly demons depending on the terminology of the specific monotheistic religion consider the following famous polytheistic religions ancient egypt amun ra is apparently self created creator god who ruled over many all of the other egyption gods ancient greece all greek gods can be traced back to the single primordial god chaos please note do not pretend to have anywhere near complete understanding of the mythologies of these groups ive just done very superficial survey of these belief systems there seems to be enough evidence at least from superficial look at these few religions that it would have been feasible for these various religions to have grown out of monotheistic world view rather than vice versa is there any evidence to suggest whether either polytheism or monotheism came first as an established form of religion or do we even have any way of knowing
747 im in year ancient history class studying rome and whenever look over ancient sources on wikipedia there is always list of lost works and occasionally sentence describing how unfortunate it is we dont have one of them for whatever particular reason im curious though are these actually works that are lost permanently or are we still discovering more of these currently take suetonius as an example of such historian

787 in the art of war sun tzu opined that if you put your army on forced march of certain speed you will lose one third of your troops along the way rough rule of thumb was that an army would start to disintegrate after losing about one third of its strength at what point do armies tend to break were the advantages to be gained by forced march usually enough to compensate for such diminution of an armys strength or did an army on forced march lose significantly less than one third its strength because it sloughed off by definition its weakest members
789 there are books and articles about the soviet submarine and the uss scorpion in with various stories of attempted nuclear attacks and reprisals is there factual narrative about these events or non events if thats the case
793 in medieval times an attacking army that had breached the walls outer defense of city could enter it and overrun the defenders at relatively little cost major modern exception was the battle of stalingrad the city was invaded and largely overrrun but the defenders were able to conduct successful house to house street to street defense in the remainder for two months until the germans were surrounded by counterattack similar thing occurred with the warsaw uprising in polish rebels were able to hold parts of the city against greatly superior forces for two months basically until their food and ammunition ran out these battles constrasted greatly with other less successful city defenses such as those of rostov and kharkov earlier in the same war why was that
805 in general ulysees grant began the final campaign against richmond using war of attrition thats because of the unions to numerical advantage against qualitatively superior confederate force better led and fighting on home ground in series of battles wilderness spotsylvania cold harbor grant advanced about miles in one month at the cost of about men roughly to loss ratio compared to about for the confederates when these tactics earned him the sobriquet of butcher grant his retort was ill fight it out along these lines if it takes all summer once his proximity to richmond reduced the confederates capacity for maneuver the union loss ratio went down to to and ultimately to spelling doom for the outnumbered confederates does ulysses grants using such attrition tactics help or hinder winning the war
808 know that this question might get closed but will try it nevertheless the reason why am so interested in broad comparisons of historical situations with current ones is because believe that this is the single largest contribution the field of history can have to society my very broad question goes like this what historical situation is comparable to what europe is currently facing by the current situation am particularly interested in the following qualities relatively large cultural differences between regions mature and stable societies that have not faced crisis for significant period of time half century in the current case being significant power but falling behind in the power race unsustainable in the long term aging societies unless of course action is taken if you believe that the question should get closed please try to think of how can ask question to gain knowledge to better understand how europe got into the current situation and how it is likely to come out of it
812 often hear stories about enemies defeating elephant riders by axing the legs of the elephants does this mean that the commander of the elephant army did not put enough armor on the elephants legs
813 the treaty of versailles forced germany to accept all responsibility for the war if the war was initially due to the assassination of archduke ferdinand by serbian assassins why did the treaty of versailles hold germany responsible are there documents that establish the reasoning behind holding germany accountable is it because they were the first to invade neutral territories are there competing claims narratives

825 viktor suvorov is somewhat famous ex gru spy who defected and wrote series of books the most infamous and sensational were series of books on world war ii starting with icebreaker which alleged with supporting historical facts and documents that stalin was planning to attack nazi germany in with the end goal of rolling over entire europe having read the book in russian the logic seemed fairly sound and the cited facts sounded legit at least to teenager who had decent knowledge of history for an average person but not more however in study of history context it seems that suvorovs books and theories are viewed between disputed and outright scientific fraud lot of discussions are summarized on the wiki soviet offensive plans controversy but the point of view was even expressed right here on history se in wladimir palants answer to why did hitler attack the soviet union when he was still busy fighting the united kingdom im not aware of any serious historians favoring this theory and suvorov unfortunately isnt one he seems to be willingly omit or even falsificate facts in his books by misquoting and quoting out of context my question is are there specific examples of suvorov omitting proven historical facts that majorly contradict his theories logic or especially falsify proven historical facts
831 why did hannibal attack with elephants from the front why not from side also why did the elephants just keep walking through the small gap why not wreak havoc in the middle of roman troops like heat seeking missiles why did the elephants just keep charging forward why was hannibals cavalry routed even if theyre routed once the roman cavalry return why they dont join in

858 according to this guy the jewish rebellion in that ignited the war with rome was by no means inevitable judaism was legal religion in the roman empire and neros own empress poppaea was very interested in it contrary to biblical novels and movies far worse things could happen to you in the ancient world than to be conquered by rome the romans hung out the traffic lights in their sprawling empire curbing piracy at sea and brigandage by land thus providing security in the mediterranean world the apostle pauls missionary journeys would have been impossible without the pax romana the roman peace that ordered society as for the horrors of roman taxation would much rather have paid the tribute to rome as citizen of jerusalem than american income tax hed rather pay roman tax than pay american income tax wonder how much romans actually had to pay
863 in this scifi se answer to can we date the technology in the lord of the rings movies made statement that wasnt able to research as fully as id have liked and therefore would like confirmation of whether historical research supports it gunpowder used to blow up the wall at helms deep the earliest invention is in china 6th to 9th century but it was not used for explosives back then iirc the first mention of the use of black powder for explosives could find was dicovery channels un cited mention of 12th century in china the first use of black powder as explosive as opposed to projectile propellant in europe eludes me but it wasnt used for civilian purposes mining explosives till 17th century so the questions are is there confirmed source indicating the use of black powder for military purpose explosives as early as 12th century ad in china as in to blow stuff up instead of to propel something are there no references to earlier use what was the earliest confirmed such use in europe other regions matter less since isengard seems to be europe equivalent in tolkien kinda geography situated north of gondor as lennart correctly surmised was thinking of the use of black powder for demolition type effect as was done in lotr not as an explosive in shrapnel producing grenade bomb
868 whether its indiana jones national treasure or the latest dan brown novel popular culture has fallen in love with the idea of finding long lost treasure preferably in some elaborate underground vault forgotten by the passage of time the hero typically has to find clues and solve puzzles in order to find out where the treasure is or to open the hidden vault its contained within of course those are just movies but im wondering are there some real life examples of long lost treasure being found are there any cases where the discoverer had to solve series of puzzles or riddles in order to find or access the treasure

888 according to wikipedia other sources and politically incorrect stereotypes the majority of the famous conquistadors were from the present day spanish autonomous community of extremadura hern cort francisco pizarro hernando de soto pedro de alvarado pedro de valdivia lvar ez cabeza de vaca alonso de sotomayor francisco de orellana vasco ez de balboa note that extremadura is landlocked and ships bound to the americas typically departed from andalusias atlantic coast source wikimedia commons source wikimedia commons nevertheless john michael francis mentions that the majority of conquistadors were from andalusia the makeup of each expedition was similar with an average of percent from the southern spanish kingdom of andalusia percent from neighboring extremadura percent from the core kingdoms of old and new castile and the remainder from other regions in the iberian peninsula other europeans were rate restricted to the odd portuguese genoese flemish or greek man can think of only few conquistadors working for the spanish crown that were not from extremadura christopher and bartholomew columbus were from genoa jaun de la cosa was from santo in present day cantabria juan ponce de le was from santerv de campos in present day castile and le gonzalo jim nez de quesada and sebasti de belalc zar were from cordova and the pinz brothers from huelva in andalusia alonso de ojeda was from cuenca in present day castile la mancha what led extremadurans to take leading role in the conquest of spains territories in the americas

951 do not know whether running farm has ever been considered the most prestigious kind of work but it is certainly nowhere near as prestigious as for example being doctor at least in my part of the world the exception is maybe if one runs winery why is it like this does it have historical reasons if this changed over time when did it loose its prestige am mostly after non localized answer but in case someone wants to know my part of the world is northern europe
954 the decisive battle of the great northern war between sweden and russia was the battle of poltava thats located deep in the ukraine southeast of kiev between cherkassy and kharkov that seems like strange place for swedish army especially one based on the baltic in livonia which encompasses latvia and estonia one would expect such an army to march east to moscow or perhaps north to the newly founded city of st petersburg apparently swedens king charles xii had led his army west across poland all the way to occupy saxony the home of the elected king of poland with the aim of making poland puppet state then back east across poland for an invasion of russia via lithuania which then also included modern belarus and parts of the ukraine did king charles xii create new base in southern polish cities like krakow and lublin from which to draw supplies and reinforcements for what would then be logical invasion of the ukraine was he trying to conquer ukraine on behalf of his new polish allies or were the allies in question perhaps the turks natural enemies of russia if so were they supplying him across the black sea and up the dniepr river what was he doing at poltava was he trying to go around the main russian army and take moscow from the rear basically it doesnt make sense for swedish army to be that far south except possibly at the head of grand coalition involving other countries
964 the vikings appear to have had two long lasting communities in greenland and site has been found at lanse aux meadows in newfoundland canada but is there any solid evidence that the vikings had more extensive presence in pre columbian north america
970 early in the past millennium kiev was probably the largest most modern city in the former soviet union at least until the mongols came one might have expected it to be the capital of the soviet union with its location on the dnepr river and relatively easy access to eastern and southern europe plus the black sea via the dniepr or did mongols change all that another logical main city is st petersburg formerly the capital with its coastal position and window to western europe looking at the capitals of europe they are mainly located on the coast oslo stockholm helsinki or along major river london on the thames paris on the seine not far from the sea moscow by comparison seems to be in the middle of nowhere the only comparison can think of is polands warsaw which became the capital when poland and the former lithuania merged with warsaw being near the center of the combined country or is that why it became russias capital and largest city with equal access to the baltic and the urals the white and black seas
982 as best as understand it the founding of the islamic republic of iran in was when persia became iran what was the motivation for changing the name

1000 when europeans started showing up in the new world the native cultures were technologically far behind many still used stone tools north american tribes used flint while some mesoamerican cultures used obsidian andean and other civilizations worked precious metals for decorative purposes was made aware in the comments that some cultures had indeed adopted bronze working or even used meteoric iron but on the whole the use of hard metals like bronze and iron doesnt appear to have been nearly as widespread as in the old world despite many parts of the americas having rich metal deposits so my question is which cultures did make extensive use of metals for producing tools and weapons and why did metalworking technology not become as prevalent in pre colombian america as it did across eurasia
1007 most of the royal rulers in the last years seemed to be strongly relying as one of the sources of their power on the notion that they hold divine rule sanction of god mandate of heaven etc examples abound from pharaoh in egypt to christian monarchs in europe to chinese emperors to even alexander the greats supposedly half gold ancestry was wondering if there was an example of monarch who ruled purely based on secular basis with zero claims to religious mandate ideally should be dynasty succession of heirs on the throne 20th century socialist communist dictators dont count even if kim family of north korea can be described as royalty from certain angle if possible id prefer non obscure and non trivial example king of villages with population totaling people on some remote island is not quite what was looking for lets say lower bound is subjects geographical area of at least square kilometers the size of manhattan island if anyone cares and the combined reign of the king and ideally his heirs exceeds years
1017 historically armies usually had balance between warriors with projectile weapons bows guns and close combat edged weapons sword pike axe etc this was necessary because ranged weapons of the time were not good enough to prevent armored enough or just fast enough force to close in with the shooters and hack them down with swords in some armies the same warriors fulfilled both roles mongols gun equiped cavalrymen of year war or bayonetted riflemen but the swordsman pikeman role was just as required as with separated roles even mongols after raining down arrows on an enemy closed in for edged weapon fight same with year war cavalry or infantry tercios this is obviously not the case today where handheld edged weapons are last resort backup and rarely used in full on combat outside urban fighting or even including it my question is what was the first battle that clearly was fought by both sides in the modern way with vast majority of the fighting by design being done by firing projectile weapons at distance to clarify the question in response to comments at distance simply means that the casualty was inflicted by solid object propelled away from the soldier and not held in the hand in other words bullet shot from gun counts clubbing over the head with the gun stock doesnt vast majority as measured by either most importantly casualty ratios from ranged weapon wounds vs handheld weapon wounds yeah us army infantryman today is trained and able to kill an enemy with bayonet an entrenching tool combat knife or pencil or toothpick if need be but in random infantry on infantry battle how many enemy casualties are inflicted by toothpicks how many by bayonets knives and how many by bullets alternately by attempted attacks where attempted attack is fired bullet or single strike with edged weapon by design meaning that your doctrine your training and your expected and actual battle intends for that vast majority fighting as defined above to be with ranged weapon this is important to eliminate useless trivial example where small force came in for regular ancient style sword infantry fight got people killed at distance from bow got frightened and ran away before closing in because the enemy was too numerically superior the casualty ratio is for range weapons but that is by accident not design this is about personal ranged weapons say man portable bows rifles muskets it excludes things like artillery airplanes tanks minor complication would be included in whether hand thrown edged weapons count as range weapons which might plausibly introduce as possible answer some javelin exclusive battle im not aware of as hand held edge weapons in which case range weapons distance must be increased to exceed throw distance or simply ignored which introduces neither of those complexities
1030 one of the common reasons given for the renaissance and the subsequent scientific revolution is the rediscovery of classical works by scholars in europe and the social change that the study of those works brought however the byzantine empire and the islamic world at that time also had access to the ancient greek and roman works in fact there were several islamic scientists during the early middle ages who made important discoveries what are the major reasons then that the renaissance and the scientific revolution happened in europe but not in the other two regions in fact why didnt such change happen in the ancient world itself was it the establishment of universities that happened in large part in europe that was responsible for this change
1031 prior to americas entry into wwi the zimmerman telegram was one incident that helped push america to declare war against germany and join the allies while mexico never fought against the us so was this even possibility dont know how strong mexico was at the time everything have read says it was not able to sustain war of any kind against the us and considering how far germany was would there have been any way for germany to give aid the telegram seems more ruse on the us than way for germany to incite mexico to wage war on the us and distract the us from the war in europe

1070 wikipedia says that ronald reagan persuaded saudi arabia to rise oil production so to drop the prices and make pressure on the soviet economy encountered such claim in many other sources as well but if we look at the oil production plot we can see that in there was actually drop in oil production by saudi arabia while the ussr had the peak of oil production at the same time saudi arabia increased production only after the production by the ussr dropped in the end of 1980s so was not it actually the ussr who dropped the prices and not saudi arabia
1085 from my understanding of the qing dynasty and few more dyansties before it as well the empire under the emperor owned all land power and responsibilities were delegated to state elected bureaucrats who control either geographic region or an aspect of government pretty much like modern day governors and secretaries from my knowledge there were no fiefdoms nobles warrior lords knights nor exchange of land for protection deals between the multiple layers of government the qing dynasty seems more like monarchical federalist bureaucracy than feudalism why is it still considered the feudalistic era of chinese history in fact feel like qing dynastys system of government management is almost as far from feudalism as you can get
1087 have heard that the number of legs horse has in the air in statue indicates how the rider died according to what have understood legs in the air rider died in battle leg in the air rider died by wounds made in battle legs in the air rider died by any other reason is there any truth in this or was it tradition at any point or place
1110 the modern country of somalia is pretty much universally considered failed state within somalia itself however is the de facto state of somaliland which if remember correctly is almost exactly coterminus with the former colony of british somalia the failed portions are almost entirely in the former italian holdings making things even better somaliland was an independent state for week before joining in federation with italian somalia now politically understand that the has certain allies in the region that would not like it to be an independent country but im not clear on those geopolitics furthermore its not like the is the only country that recognize other countries what id like to understand is what these historical animosities are and what the present geopolitical ramifications would be of recognition in short why dont most countries recognize somaliland
1141 question says mostly all to be more concrete am talking about the popularity of krishna and buddhism on the religious side and stuff like yoga on the more practical side some other things might be the popularity of gurus etc
1150 often encounter claim that the hitler came to power democratically exploiting democratic procedures was elected etc such claims are usually made by right wing liberals who use this argument to justify political restrictions on their opponents as being painful but necessary measure sometimes the nazis are counterpoised to the bolshevicks who the narrator alleges unlike the nazis made an anti democratic coup which makes them even worse in the view of the narrator but if we look at the results of the german elections we see that the share of nazi party in reichstag before was not much exceeding the last elections before were even less successful to nazi party because their share shrank while the share of german communists rose these numbers did not allow the nazis to form cabinet according the constitution and there was no possibility of an alliance with other parties as we know hitler was appointed to kanzler office by the president following behind the scenes deal among german political elite so my question is how much the claim that hitler came to power democratically is justified

1199 today we use the terms america and the united states as synonyms the official name of the country is the united states of america but prompted by question on another forum wherein an author writing in referred to america and the united states am curious as to whether the terms have always been precise synonyms now the question in this case may be put down simply to bad writing but in the united states of america included states and territories as it does today would the term america have been at that time larger concept not precisely synonymous with the united states in the civil war did america mean anything that could be pinned down precisely or did everything depend on the viewpoint of the speaker

1213 there seems to be widespread feeling that the us electoral college distorts the will of the people in presidential elections of course that ability was part of the reason that our founding fathers introduced the system but ever since the rise of political parties and state laws restricting elector votes the system doesnt do anything to provide the protections originally envisioned the major political parties dont seem to really want to get rid of the system for fear of causing unpredictable changes to their power while one side or the other grumbles about the results of particular elections no changes that im aware of in recent years has been seriously pushed have there been reform campaigns in the past not counting the 12th amendment why didnt they succeed

1382 in november three months after the battle of stalingrad began the soviet union launched operation uranus counterencirclement of the german forces in and around the city in two prongs the larger northern prong debouched from the south bend of the don heading southeast and four days later reached the appointed rendezvous point at kalach miles west of stalingrad which contained the main german line of communications day or so later the smaller southern prong of the attack was launched from the west bank of the volga on northwesterly course with kalach three days distant about one day into the advance it was counterattacked and briefly halted by the german 29th motorized division before this division was redeployed to resist the northern thrust but had the germans known what was going on they might have reinforced the 29th motorized and at least stopped the southern thrust from arriving at kalach to complete the encirclement suppose this had happened was the capture of kalach by the northern group sufficient by itself to isolate the germans is there reason to believe that the northern thrust would have been able to complete the encirclement on its own by marching past kalach to the volga if this were not the case or would the germans have been able to escape from stalingrad if they had managed to stop the southern thrust from reaching kalach
1416 with regards to the union victory at gettysburg being the turning point of the american civil war were there any major confederate victories after the battle of gettysburg did the confederacy ever come close to returning the war to their favor if they did come close are their any battles that historians regard as battle that if it had gone the other way it would have led to longer drawn out war or would be more correct in thinking that following the battle of gettysburg it seemed that any chance of confederacy victory was very slim

1460 know that some african nations participated in the slave trade by providing captured enemies as slaves to europeans but what are some of the reasons they did was it simply new economic opportunity that they took advantage of and sought to use to gain advantage against their rivals im looking for nice synthesis of the issue and some decent sourcing to other materials or book recommendations
1466 after wwii france was in rebuilding mode and yet they insisted on trying to reclaim indo china it would seem that in the new world order this did not make much sense for country that was trying to rebuild itself to commit to such massive amount of blood and treasure to something that would arguably not produce much dividends in the future im looking for some articulated reasons by the post wwii french government to try and reclaim the territory or compelling cost benefit argument as to why they pursued this course of action
1476 one thing that comes up often when discussing what ifs with family or friends is why the british government never nabbed alaska when russia had placed it up for sale and made it into canadas fourth territory was it bad timing canada gained self governance that year lack of money hard to believe with an empire of that size or lack of interest or indeed another reason that havent thought of

1499 was reading an article and was wondering if there is anything out there to indicate that the founding fathers saw the potential for conflict regarding these specific points economic and social differences between the north and the south states versus federal rights is there any evidence to indicate that during and after the revolutionary war the time frame during which the united states was being formed into its own country some of the founding fathers saw the potential for future conflicts that might lead to national dispute is there any evidence that would suggest certain founding fathers warned that such issues could lead to civil war is there any evidence to suggest that any were aware that such dispute had high chance of happening but decided to forge ahead with the confidence that the newly formed government could resolve such issues over time

1514 when reading about operation downfall noticed that if japan had not surrendered following the nuclear bombs at hiroshima and nagasaki there could have been at least more nuclear bombs ready for the invasion am unable to find any information about the plans for these bombs or any plans regarding more bombs to be used before an invasion of japan with operation downfall being developed it seemed that there was thought that few nuclear attacks would not force japan to surrender was wondering if there is any information about other nuclear bomb targets before during and after an invasion of japan

1529 the new book the man without face by masha gessen is at least partially intended to humanize russian leader vladimir putin in hopes that it will eliminate the power he appreciates by maintaining fearful reputation as is discussed in her interview on the daily show here has book ever been so incendiary so revelatory that it resulted in the leader it criticized being removed from power acknowledge that there are likely many factors contributing to the downfall of an oppressive leader what am after here is an instance where book can be cited among the causes of leader being removed

1547 modern readers of lewis carrolls books alices adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass will undoubtedly make some connections between radical changes in perspective following the ingestion of special foods and drinks and recreational drug use these connections may be partially due to the use of imagery from the books by the drug culture of the 1960s and 1970s but also due to relative familiarity with recreational drug use in modern culture would the original readers of the book circa made similar connections note am not asking if lewis carroll intended the books to be about drugs but whether victorian era reader would have considered this to be valid interpretation
1552 since the police invited security firms to bid for roles in the uk was wondering if there are historical events where mercenaries were used to police city or town or local and what the effects were suspect that the years war would have quiet few of those but cannot think of specific examples
1553 so ive got relation that was born 8th february tuam galway ireland now at that time ireland was under british rule but shortly afterwards gained independence thats my understanding anyway so im trying to trace the birth certificate and im wondering about open questions such as was she british or irish or did she start british and become irish automatically as child and more to the point where am likely to find her birth certificate would that sort of thing have been centrally held at the time
1579 you may remember that the united states and great britain had minor spat in which shall we say did not put them on the friendliest of terms in while britain was focused on its war with france the same country decided to take advantage of the situation and declare war on the united states the 1820s saw the aroostock war and border disputes between maine and canada there was also the pigs ear war and whilst or fight didnt result in anything major it is reasonable to say that the usa and the uk were not on particularly great terms moreover during the american civil war the uk came close to recognizing the confederate states of america and yet by the time the usa needed to demarcate its alaskan boundaries in the uk was good friend by wwi the usa were supporting its english ally even over against the germans who arguably had populations that were almost as big and certainly by wwii there was special relationship that finally helped tipped the balance so given this history between the usa and uk heres the simple question how did the us and the uk become such good friends obviously theres the historical connection but overcoming the animosity of having to fight for your independence and the stain of having lost its colony has to hurt when and how did usa and uk patch things up
1584 what evidence is there to call the conflict between poland and the soviet union war of independence as for definition of independence would say it is full political legal and military independence from another state for example vassal becoming independent in war note this is based on comment on this answer
1646 if there is anything in my mind that has been particularly pronounced about american historical interests it has been an overriding interest in the military aspects of history this can be viewed in the curriculum of american schools where the conquests of the greco romman empires and european american wars are given lions share of attention in the history channel where before the channels devolving into series of reality shows and alien biblical nonsense was virtually monopolized by commentary and analysis of the civil war and world war ii it can even be seen on this forum where many of the posts seem to focus on military history tactics and culture think it is very important for america and given its power the rest of the world as well to determine if and if so why americans have become so focused on the military aspects of history are there examples of other empires such as england the netherlands spain etc having similar cultural fixations on the military or is this unique aspect of american culture if this is trend what in american history has lead to the development of our military veneration while believe this question may stray from the forums format somewhat do believe that it neither deviates too strongly from said format or is phrased in such way that it is impossible to provide analysis of trends which can be backed up by solid research
1653 after the resolution of the revolutionary war john adams and later thomas jefferson were diplomatic agents in london john adams had been there while and had previously met the king apparently amiably happen to be reading american sphinx by joseph ellis where on page it is stated when jefferson visited adams in england in the spring of the two former revolutionaries were presented at court and george iii ostentatiously turned his back on the both neither man ever forgot the insult or the friend standing next to him when it happened recently read john adams by david mccullough where the same incident is stated differently on page when adams presented jefferson at the kings levee at st jamess on march george iii could not have been more ungracious in his notice of mr adams and myself according to an account later provided by jefferson later still grandson of adamss would take this to mean the king had turned his back on them and the story would become rooted in history but almost certainly no such incident occurred jefferson said nothing to the effect at the time nor did any of the numerous ministers courtiers members of parliament and other diplomats present who were ever watchful for the slightest sign of royal disapproval or anything the least out of the ordinary nothing untoward was reported or hinted at in the newspapers and importantly nothing was ever said or written by james adams who of all men would have been enraged by any disrespect shown minister of the united states being presented under his sponsorship ellis footnotes the version he reports rather extensively including letter from adams to jefferson not too long after the event and in their respective autobiographies so any further insight on what happened did it actually happen did king george iii turn his back on john adams and thomas jefferson
1660 am computer science undergrad with great interest in history lately have been asking myself if there are general aspects or specialities of computer science which lend themselves to the study of history given that would likely find any such combination of great interest and others here would too thought this would be good topic to ask here not only are there potentially other technically minded people but also history professionals who may already be working with specific computer technology methods and algorithms brownie points for those who provide specific references of potentially applicable technology such as algorithms programs methodology etc super omg points for those who provide specific avenues of research which combine the study of history with approaches from computational disciplines have some specific examples which will provide in the answer section if there is some confusion over the general question or if answers are not necessarily forthcoming understand that this is question that may be better suited to another forum or to two forums understand if the community feels that this question needs to be migrated
1690 although india and pakistan became independent states simultaneously they have been travelling in different paths after that many believe that democracy is major reason for the difference in fortune of both countries pakistan has been under military rule for long time during its existence while in india military has never been involved in government what are the reason for this difference military intervention in government between these two nations given that pakistan and india at least north india share common culture and they had been under the rule of same dynasties for long time also the military tradition and even officers during the early part were inherited from british raj
1700 when the united states lost the vietnam war the vietnamese showed another face of war with big difference of power the weaker country can win this is happening again in afghanistan and in iraq in afghanistan the united states one of the richest countries in the world fights with one of the poorest and even with this difference it isnt able to win the war so what im asking is can an invading country win the war if and only if the people of this invaded country are not willing to fight hard enough

1716 am fascinated by the stark differences between election mechanics strategies policies of the early united states when compared to today in the early days of the us it was seen as ungentlemanly to campaign before presidential election know that washington adams and jefferson all stayed out of the fray though perhaps surreptitiously directing subordinates to do the campaigning work now of course campaigning for president is more than full time job how long did this difference last when did it become acceptable to even acknowledge that you want the post
1722 what were the economic effects of the cuban revolution were living conditions improved for the average cuban im looking for objective criteria like average income wealth distribution life expectancy literacy and similar
1737 it is often alleged that grand part in the success of the nazi and fascist movements in europe was their hard line anti communism thy used anti communist sentiments to gain popularity and even many people who did not share their views in general still supported them due to their anti communist stance so wonder what was the reason why anti communism gained such popularity in europe it should be noted that the criticism of communism of the late 20th century is not applicable to the first half the major cold war era critcisms included human rights violations deficit of democracy inefficiency of planned economy and lack of economic freedom but in the first half of 20th century many anti communists would support authoritarian government state regulation and restrictions on political rights to even greater degree than in communist countries there are several theories why anti communism was so popular the communists themselves claim that the wealthy classes oppose communism because they want to keep their wealth and social inequality this theory does not explain why anti communist movements such as the whites included many people who were ready to sacrifice not only their wealth but also their lives to the fight against communism and that it included many of those who did not belong to the wealthy classes or belonged only formerly without any hope to return the possessions it should be also noted that in many cases the anti communists employed extreme and difficult to explain cruelty to captured bolshevicks such as freezing them alive driving nails in their heads and the like which is not normally observed in any economically motivated wars such as wars for resources or colonies sometimes it is argued that the hatred towards communism was motivated by religion that the people just fought against atheism rather than an economic system this idea also does not explain why those anti communists themselves supported regimes that were sometimes hostile or indifferent towards religion or even concluded alliances with states which worshiped non christian faith such as islam or buddhism and why they were equally hostile towards left leaning clerics counting them as traitors so what are the reasons of the widespread hatred towards communism in the first half of xxth century
1740 almost all of the information that can find with regards to the moorish invasion of the iberian peninsula simply states when the moors invaded there seems to be very little on what the motivation of the moors was to invade the iberian peninsula is this just little studied area of history im hoping someone can provide some academic sources supporting reason why they invaded and not just stating that they did invade
1754 cant seem to find information about economists or others warning about the overheated stock market of the 1920s in the us that would culminate in the stock market crashing on black thursday october 24th and black tuesday october 29th keep seeing general statements that prudent experts warned about the overheated stock market but that is it if you could provide paper names or books published prior to those dates that would be great if it has to be post event book or paper it needs to be one that provides the names who warned against the possibility of crash
1756 during the spanish civil war to to what extent did the international brigades play role in fighting the fascists coup my understanding is that they were relatively minor element mostly dramatized by the republican government and socialist parties world wide however am really interested to know if they were effective in any major battles would also like to know the level of soviet support that was given to the brigades in comparison to international support for the republican government and fascist support for the military coup wikipedia provides some interesting statistics apparently heavily from antony beevors the battle for spain but some context and additional sources would be appreciated
1758 the molotov ribbentrop pact was the non aggression pact between the soviet union and nazi germany prior to and during wwii it seems that the actions of the two countries after the invasion of poland would confirm suspicions that they were working in concert in some fashion but that doesnt mean that the specific secret agreements were known to the allied powers my question is did churchill roosevelt or their administrations know at any point prior to entering into an alliance with the soviet union that there were explicit agreements between nazi germany and the soviet union
1759 the northern expansion doctrine was the idea that japan should pursue its imperialist objectives through siberia which was diametrically opposed by the southern expansion doctrine which was the idea that japan should pursue its imperialist objectives in the pacific know that the southern expansion doctrine was supported by the navy and became the controlling doctrine for japans military actions after failure of the northern expansion doctrine epitomized by the defeat of the japanese army by the soviet union at the battle of khalkhin gol but cannot find any information about the formation of the northern expansion doctrine there is information out there about the genesis of the southern expansion doctrine but not the northern expansion doctrine my question is what was the genesis of the northern expansion doctrine within the japanese military and government
1798 read stalin triumph and tragedy by dmitri volkogonov and believe it said that stalin didnt kill anyone with his own hands he signed lot of death lists but those are just pieces of paper did he kill anyone with his own hands or watch any executions
1799 reading about the election statistics in the united states was amazed about how few votes are received by the minor parties and their candidates for example gloria la riva received only votes in country of million registered voters for the presidential elections in suspect this only marginally exceeds the number of her friends and relatives am quite sure that nothing similar could happen in most other voting cultures if person is registered as presidential candidate and is on the list they no doubt will receive at least several hundreds of thousands of votes no matter how unpopular or unknown he or she is this is because of the following factors protest voting people who do not like the major candidates may vote for somebody unknown so to signal their protest confusion somebody confused the candidate with another public figure due to similarity in the name solidarity people from the same geographical area town or the same ethnic religious background or the same profession or the same sex may vote for an unknown candidate just due to some background similarity people of the same neighbourhood usually are well aware of their candidate even if he did not receive federal media coverage random voting people just vote for somebody with funny name or happy number in the list biography readers some elderly people in many countries still retain their habit of thoroughly reading the candidates biography usually listed at the voting place and if they like they can vote despite any tv advertisement just mistakes person wanted to vote for another candidate but mistakenly selected this one or mistake during the counting so wonder why these factors do not have any force in the us to me it seems completely unrealistic and fantastic that person included in the federal presidential list can earn so few votes
1835 at the end of wwii were nazis working on anything else besides the if so what was it how close was it to completion and could it have potentially turn the events around for them
1851 how did nazi germany finance itself during the war they produced large amount of war material during but how was this production financed what were germanys revenue streams that enabled them to purchase and transport the raw materials of war and pay the workers doubt they were exporting goods during the war so any revenue was likely internal to the country given the depression was still going on in how did they pay for the war
1869 the germans knew that oil would be crucial to the war and that they would likely need to capture new sources for the war effort the main oil producing regions at the time that might be captured were the caucasus region of southern russia and the middle east the germans committed hundreds of divisions in their attempts to take the russian oil but mere fractions of this to the african front which was less well defended why is this and why were the following not considered to help hitler had helped franco in the spanish civil war why not get the spanish to capture gibraltar thus tipping the balance of power in the mediterranean decisively towards the axis were any political attempts made to get turkey to join the war on the axis side thus allowing second front to be opened in the middle east and russia could the dak have been activated sooner and with greater resources including more luftwaffe support by staging more aggressive campaign sooner could the germans have won in north africa thus gaining sufficient oil in order to not have to worry about it when barbarossa was launched
1877 am reading about the spanish civil war in book by antony beevor entitled the battle for spain the spanish civil war according to beevor while the nationalists were able to control the skies by using superior german made aircraft the republicans had the edge in tank combat with soviet 26s he also claims that the spanish civil war lead to the development of heavier german tanks dont know too much about german tank design especially before world war ii what was the technological state of german tanks in comparison to other major armies of the 1920s and 1930s did the russians maintain superior tank design into world war ii assuming what beevor said is true note understand that superior is difficult to define for example my understanding that while the tiger tank may have been widely considered superior to the american sherman tank the american army was able to turn out such high quantities of the sherman that they were able to overwhelm the numerically smaller german tank divisions believe thats the case anyway
1890 this article on the end of the ancient egyptian civilization posits four different points at which the civilization ended is it the definitive end of native egyptian rule at least until the 20th century in this case the answer would be the flight of king nectanebo ii in bc is it egypts absorption into the roman empire in bc or the last appearance of the ancient hieroglyphic script just before ad or the closure of the last pagan temples in the sixth century the article seems to argue that the final option the closing of the last pagan temples is the most appropriate for the end of the civilization can find lot of articles advocating that the end was when the civilization was absorbed into the roman empire but am wondering is this the majority view amongst academics and does it make the most sense as the end of the civilization realize this is somewhat opinion based what history isnt but there should be someone who can articulate why one point is the accepted majority if it exists at all
1910 was the ww2 memoir death traps by belton cooper historically accurate
1924 today visited again the kansas cosmosphere and space center space flight history museum and noticed for the first time the claim that part of john kennedys motivation for pushing for manned moon landing by was an attempt to get russia and perhaps the as well to focus research and financial energies on peaceful space race rather than potentially devastating nuclear arms race to what extent is it possible to know how successful this objective was clearly the cold war never got hot ignoring the proxy wars that were fought but would the outcome have likely been different sans space race

1976 am specifically interested in the period right before the beginning of the newspaper era which im broadly defining as the 18th century so lets say was there phenomenon like our present day current events that people ie commoners would be aware of or were the going ons of royals and sovereigns mostly the province of the elite
1977 my suspicions are that road in rome italy likely has strong claim or perhaps road in egypt it just needs to be road that has been in continuous use for traffic whether it was some form of vehicle or pedestrian through the present day per the concerns raised by some of the comments the requirements are regular upkeep some sort of system of paving some sort of control over the road by city
1983 earlier today barack obama declared his support for gay marriage he told abc news for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that think same sex couples should be able to get married gawker claims he is the first us president to openly support gay marriage but who was the first head of government to do so in world history
2004 wikipedia puts the boundary as the modern definition of europe delimits it from asia at the aegean sea the dardanelles sea of marmora bosporus the black sea along the watershed of the greater caucasus the northwestern portion of the caspian sea and along the ural river and ural mountains as both mapped and listed in many atlases including that of the national geographic society and as described in the world factbook however there is no cite for this and cant seem to find definitive information what group or individual put forward this as the boundary between europe and asia know that this boundary has changed lot historically so im curious as to the most current boundary assuming wikipedia is correct

2014 im listening to gettysburg by stephen sears and the officers on both sides seem to always exhort their men to aim low for instance general john gibbon told his 2nd division infantry do not hurry men and fire too fast let them come up close before you fire and then aim low and steadily gettysburg this was on july as picketts division approached cemetery ridge there seem to be number of variations on the command such as fire at their feet but it always seems to be intended to correct the problem of overshooting rather than undershooting it makes sense to me that artillery fire could be more effective if the rounds bounded across the ground and at gettysburg the southern gunners tended to fire ineffectually over the heads of the union line but would have assumed the best musket and rifle shots would have been aimed slightly high to account for ballistic trajectory this might have been better question for the late firearms se but what was it about civil war weaponry that caused trained soldiers to need reminding to aim low
2024 on the night of july the western allies mounted an amphibious invasion of sicily three days later hitler summoned nther von kluge and erich von manstein to his wolfsschanze headquarters in east prussia and declared his intention to temporarily call off operation zitadelle von manstein attempted to dissuade him arguing that zitadelle was on the brink of victory on no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves which he had committed were decisively beaten in an unusual reversal of their roles hitler gave von manstein few more days to continue the offensive but on july he ordered withdrawal and canceled the operation he then ordered the entire ss panzer corps to be transferred to italy while hitler often made notoriously poor judgments for all the wrong reasons did he make the right decision for germany for the wrong reason in this specific isolated case was zitadelle really on the brink of victory as von manstein believed
2026 know that gandhi was involved in the civil rights movement in south africa during he beginning of the 20th century but was there specific person or group that he learned how to protest through non violent means
2027 ive read the german and english wikipedia on this topic as well as the translated belarussian version and some sites googled they all seem to argue that the rus part stems from the region called ruthenia the german version advocates that the bela part might derive from word meaning western as the western part of the rus whereas in the english wikipedia it is translated as white also according to the english version the name originated in the 13th century have colleague at work from belarus and he says something completely different according to him the country was named after beautiful bela girl called rus around the year does somebody know where his believe comes from and what the more likely true explanation is my colleagues explanation sounds like conspiracy theory to me only the historians who loved their country explain how it really was and all the information find on the web was either misinformation spread from the current government or propaganda left from the time when belarus was part of the soviet union
2042 in the united states we received changes in the social safety net over the past century with the big changes coming in the form of social security and medicaid medicate as well as other programs the great society under the johnson administration in the 1960s was the last big program change introduction yet in early american society there was lot of basis on self sufficiency that often is touted as coming from the protestant roots of many who came here somewhere along the way that self sufficiency changed to where the government needed to step in and offer aid to many including the poor citizens of this country in looking at our history we went in just over hundred years from self sufficiency and an expanding country to bread soup lines in the great depresson what precipitated this change was it industrialization social forces that changed in the late 19thc due to immigration were the uneven economic cycles of the 19thc cause im looking for historical root causes that would have allowed for change in social norms to where it was ok for people to accept help from the government rather than expect it to stay out of their way
2056 putting aside their reasons for wanting to do so and all the emotional responses they would provoke was the secession of states from the union to eventually form the confederacy an illegal act in itself was it just something that nobody was sure of until somebody bothered to try it if it wasnt illegal per se then is it now did the post war union act to make it more difficult for states to secede in the future
2062 why were so few luftwaffe attacks flown against the normandy beaches on june understand there were roughly aircraft available in france belgium and yet there were only aircraft that strafed one of the beaches the answer found via google was the aircraft were held back until reinforcements could be brought up from germany am wondering if there were other reasons for example fuel availability allied air superiority over the beaches holding the aircraft in reserve for the anticipated invasion at calais the allies seemed to be expecting the luftwaffe judging by the number of barrage balloons over the beaches why was the luftwaffe held back when the allied invasion forces were at their most vulnerable

2094 sumerian texts speak of worldwide flood that wiped out most of mankinds achievements on earth had always suspected such flood even if only covering all of sumer was mythical but then read the following on wikipedia archaeologists have confirmed the presence of widespread layer of riverine silt deposits shortly after the piora oscillation interrupting the sequence of settlement that left few feet of yellow sediment in the cities of shuruppak and uruk and extended as far north as kish theres no citation listed unfortunately so is there any reliable archaeological evidence of this flood can anyone point me in the right direction few feet of sediment means there must have been major event so im surprised hadnt run across this before
2100 dont really know how to ask this question so help in editing it to better fit the stackexchange format would be quite welcome from what can tell classical mayan civilization was exceptionally gruesome so much so that have hard time accepting it reading articles on wikipedia this is what see the cities were almost constantly at war with each other war captives were often sacrificed kings and nobles would frequently pierce their bodies for blood in public ceremonies in horrifying ways involving thorns ropes and delicate body parts there were sacrifices of children and ive heard there are few examples of cannibalism can that be right can mayan civilization really have been so horrifying know very little about the period and im hoping these aspects of it didnt really exist

2215 has the united states congress ever repealed legislation rather than amend the legislation or let the legislation be annulled by the supreme court it seems to me that once law is passed it becomes very difficult to remove such law even if it becomes evident the law is absurd or detrimental even the most notorious laws in the us only get amended so to remove the most sharp edges or get repelled by the courts as unconstitutional but are there any counter examples where the us congress opted to repeal law

2255 in the usa all that seems to matter is the letter of the law this example demonstrates how us law is being used for things it was never intended the british justice system places huge emphasis on the intent of law if law is made to discourage one activity and you do somthing very similar in grey zone the courts will likely convict you based on the intent of the law also if law was intended to discorage one thing and you do somthing completely different that was not intened to be part of the law but through some accidental wording includes what you did the courts will very likely aquit you not so in america how did the court system in america become so different from their british counterparts with regard for intent

2263 in movies books set in the napoleonic wars the british are normally deployed into lines and the french into columns the columns are usually the advancing ones charging into the line as the line hold their ground and fire volleys at the advancing column in the movies its always depicted that this situation benefits the british because they outshoot the column the whole line can shoot vs just the front rank or the outer edge of the column and they dont have to move meaning they can reload easily and faster not to mention that it seems scarier to be in the front rank of column the result is normally the french getting slaughtered before they even reach the line or when they arrive they would be so outnumbered that it becomes an unbalanced melee well to be fair of course english speaking movies tend to show british victories actual history reading seems to confirm that the french indeed liked fighting in columns but why did they do this when it seems obvious that the line is more advantageous the only advantage can think is probably faster speed because less files to harmonize but dont think this justifies the greatly reduced firepower and why is it in the movies the french seems to be the one attacking and the british standing their ground how would the french deploy if theyre the defending side is there good example of french victory using this kind of setting

2554 was reading an article on the vasa the ship built under command of king gustav adolf the ship sank during its launch on august part if the article mentions that the ship was somehow unbalanced and the idea proposed is that it was built with two different philosophies one of which is the english mediterranean version which supposedly were built around frames with well structured and precise measurements for the planking the other half of the ship was supposedly done by the dutch method which just built the ships quickly from the bottom up can kind of understand the dutch version at least from land perspective where like house you can craft something from the bottom up and use what you have which is the suggestion of the dutch method but what would be the origin of the english method which obviously meant more involved process with craftsmen and some serious education to deal with the mathematics it would take to design the ship before it was built in some ways id almost see this as going back to the early civilizations in europe like the romans or the greeks with the knowledge passed down or evolving over time would this be the case or did this arise out of later time

2605 historians have titled alexander iii of macedon the great in very short period of time he conquered one of the largest empires in ancient history and was undefeated in battle what id like to know is what factor more than any other made it possible for alexander to achieve this military historians typically focus on his battle tactics and strategies certainly those were remarkable and proven effective but was that it the macedonian army he inherited was quite skilled would alexander have achieved the same given any other army in the ancient world would he have been equally effective against another ancient army or were the particular opponents he faced particularly vulnerable to defeat know theres probably no single answer and it may well be combination of factors but id like to hear different theories
2609 some historical figures are remembered for their actions alexander of macedon napoleon while others are remembered for their intent charles de gaulle which historical figures are remembered for consequences that contradict their intent for instance one could argue that hitler is responsible for the establishment of modern day jewish homeland in the holy land that certainly was not his intent but he did much more to further that goal then theodor herzl or haim weizmann ever did however we do not traditionally celebrate hitler for this accomplishment which historical figures are celebrated or hated for an accomplishment that was contradictory to their intention

2683 historically the name persia has been applied to southern asia to disassociate that land from the people who inhabit it who called themselves aran similarly the name palestine has been applied to the levant to disassociate the area from judea to be clear understand that the names existed in sense before the broad official application to the land however they were officially decreed as names for the land by foreigners to repress the people living in the land am not referring to recent political events so please no flamewars am listing those two as examples for the sake of explanation so no need for pedantry of notable development in the past century have been the return to the ancient names to both these places iran and israel what other areas were named to disassociate the lands from their inhabitants are there any movements to restore other such lands to their former names

2810 hungary and japan were nazi germanys allies during wwii yet it could not possibly be argued that the japanese belong to the aryan race and hungarians speak non indo european language which probably disqualifies them as aryans too did the german propaganda try to account for that were there any statements from the nazi officials or scholars regarding the racial status of the hungarian and japanese people additionally considering that the nazi leaders planned enslavement and subsequent extermination of poles on racial grounds were any analogous statements made about russians during the time the ribbentrop molotov pact held what about other axis or pro axis slavic nations such as slovaks or bulgarians
2817 commented on this answer sometimes particularly in developing countries they literally are printing more money in the usa typically we increase the money supply to make up for some kind of undesirable market tightening which in theory should not cause much inflation in developing countries it is often done just to inflate away domestic debt it doesnt hurt the decision makers any as they can hide their assets in foreign currency but it absolutely trashes domestic savings emphasis mine what are the advantages and disadvantages of inflating away domestic debt by literally printing more money what are some examples from history have the theories of inflation been supported by historical evidence
2822 we all know the immense contribution ancient roman medieval roman or byzantine and pre modern hre cannon law has made to the modern world these empires relied on written constitution or code and trained magistrates lawyers and notaries cf judith herrin byzantium the surprising life of medieval empire peter wilson europes tragedy new history of the thirty years war much of todays european civil law can trace its origin to those cannons and much of our current legal framework courts judges constitution senate and lawyers are direct copy of their ideas know that india also has long tradition of its own legal principles for example we know from john keay india history that during the mughal period the administration was uniform and structured and that there existed courts known as kotwaalis and magistrates or kotwaals cf but how did this law function and how was it administered where did it originate did the mughals bring it with them or was it indigenous to india therefore have three three questions for the legal framework in indias ancient period and early middle kingdom period 2nd century bce 7th century ce was there more or less uniform law uniform law would mean that different kingdoms and janpads would follow roughly similar laws non uniformity would mean widely different laws in different realms was this law or these laws documented were there lawyers and trained magistrates

2839 how did the war affect beer production during world war ii this is follow up question to this question at seasoned advice which is gathering interesting food science answers but which are are short on historical perspective and long on historical speculation this source cites various brewers almanacs for evidence that beer strength suffered during ww2 but doesnt indicate why of course there were supply issues but what and why and what substitutions might have been made are the interesting details that would help support or discredit the answers the original seasoned advice question is getting and besides supply there could have been political social or rationing pressures on how beer was produced and distributed so speculation aside how did the war affect beer lingering after effects of the war might be interesting but thats not the main point of this question
2840 read today on the wikipedias main page there were numerous deaths at the berlin wall which stood as barrier between west berlin and east germany from august until november before erection of the berlin wall in million east germans circumvented eastern bloc emigration restrictions many by crossing over the border from east berlin into west berlin from where they could then travel to west germany and other western european countries between and the wall prevented almost all such emigration the state funded centre for contemporary history in potsdam has given the official figure of deaths including people attempting to escape border guards and innocent parties this makes overall impression that the number of deaths on the east west germany border was unusually high note that there is even museum dedicated to the victims but the number cited people looks negligible so how this number compares to the number of deaths due to incidents and illegal crossings in other inter state borders such as israel egypt india pakistan the ussr china united states mexico north africa europe

3060 every so often see newspaper article which states that the wealthiest people in my country make less substantial contributions to philanthropy relative to their wealth than do their american counterparts invariably our higher taxes are cited as reason why this is so supposedly leading some to form the opinion that they are already giving their fair share to the less fortunate if this is significant consideration it would be reasonable to also expect change in the rate of philanthropic contributions when country alters the amount of tax it collects from its wealthy im interested in whether this is so in the us given that its long had culture of philanthropy by the wealthy has such relationship with taxes been observed there have no particular definition of wealthy in mind and am open to any that allows for comparison of data from different periods

3085 on at least two occasions poland appointed as kings rulers of other countries once was in the fourteenth century when the king was lajos of hungary another was in the eighteenth century when the king was augustus the strong of saxony in neither case did poland merge with the kings other country so these personal unions did not end by uniting the two countries on the other hand poland did form partnership with lithuania by marrying off its king jadwiga lajos daughter to jogaila lithuanias grand duke king although the partnership wasnt fully consummated until the mid 16th century century and half later how would lajos for instance have ruled poland while personally governing hungary from budapest did he appoint viceroy or did he have council of polish nobles reporting loosely to him while they mostly did what they pleased did poland gain any advantage from having these kings with commitments elsewhere did the country do better or worse with lajos augustus and others if applicable in comparison with kings that did not have these conflicts of interest and are the two sets of questions in the two paragraphs related that is does how this kind of government worked affect how well the government worked

4337 eratosthenes calculations of the size of the earth were very precise and very accepted during columbus time still columbus was convinced that the world was significatively smaller and that getting to asia from europe was feasible what was the method used by columbus to calculate the size of the earth maybe more importantly why were his results accepted
4342 are there any precedents for presidents having served in other official government roles after the ends of their terms conceivably they could become ambassadors or supreme court judges for example am aware that some former presidents served on special government commissions true for president hoover under president truman or as official envoys on foreign policy occasions true for presidents carter and nixon believe but these are not official roles in the sense of this question it is about regular and permanent roles in the executive branch legislature or judiciary the background of my question is of course that presidents clinton and obama held hold office at relatively young age and they and their contemporaries normally go on to run their own foundations am wondering about conceivable alternatives
4364 after wwi the treaty of versailles became the rallying cry for more extreme political forces in germany as its terms were blamed for the countries hardships and as an insult to the country itself are the terms of treaties imposed upon germany after their defeat in wwii felt to be as insulting as the ones that were imposed with versailles to the german people of the second half of the 20th century
4368 from what read hussars are originally cavalry forces in medieval hungary but then it became class of light cavalry that were in service in many european nations and during the napoleonic wars according to wikipedia hussar most of the great european powers raised hussar regiments the armies of france austria prussia and russia had included hussar regiments since the mid 18th century in the case of britain four light dragoon regiments were converted to hussars in why were there such widespread adoption and why are they called hussars what common characteristics do these regiments have that link them to the original hussars in medieval hungary and that separated them from other light cavalry class like lancers dragoons or uhlans
4374 on recent visit to prague was much impressed by the citys beauty and the number and splendor of its historic sites such as prague castle the charles bridge bit further afield karl tejn castle its many stone towers and lovely details such as the ubiquitous cobblestone streets the extraordinary richness on display reminded me much of seville spain which also possesses mighty palaces of the nobility and huge cathedral for seville the main source of its extraordinary historic wealth seems clear its location is where ocean going cargo ships from the south american colonies were unloaded on the river guadalquivir and where hence lot of money was made and spent during the golden age of sevilla many prominent historic sites in prague similarly date back to golden age of bohemia that began with the reign of charles iv holy roman emperor and king of bohemia am wondering what brought the golden age about overall in this case the czechs are an enterprising people and in charles iv they had an enlightened ruler but assume there must still have been some economic fundamentals perhaps in the form of raw materials or new crafts specific to the region that allowed the king and the people to catalyze their own golden age which still shines today so what was the material basis for the golden age of bohemia
4377 it is my understanding that the republican party arose from the anti slavery movement and more specifically as reaction against the repeal of the missouri compromise and yet pretty early on at least as early as the reconstruction if not earlier the republican party became roughly speaking the party of big business imagine that the evolution of the gop from the anti slavery party into the pro business one was motivated largely by the relative alignments of political interests at the time but would like to know more specifically the names of those most clearly responsible for bringing about this re positioning of the gop please provide sources

4418 in soviets transferred crimea from russian soviet republic to ukrainian soviet republic why is this strange the whole act at least officially was meant to be gift token of friendship you do not normally give huge pieces of land in moderate climate which are also strategically located russians are not known for giving land away quite the contrary russia has been constantly expanding since xvii century after the deportation of the tatars by stalin russians were the majority population of crimea at that time and still are russia doesnt seem to have solid foothold of the black sea coast it seems that their only usable naval port apart from sevastopol which is in crimea and is only leased from ukraine is novorossiysk

4487 consider this in the ancient world murder and theft were prohibited however slavery was ubiquitous and considered normal afaik nobody thought of it as immoral though probably some called for kind treatment of slaves so when did people start talking of the very institution of slavery as immoral and demanding its abolition and how did they justify that obviously since they had to convince others of their point of view they couldnt just say we hold this truth to be self evident know that the church prohibited slavery in the early centuries of its existence but then allowed owning non christian slaves
5522 with regards to the ongoing us presidential elections just read this on electoral vote com could there be faithless electors presidential electors are supposed to vote for the person who got the most votes in their state or for three electors in nebraska and two in maine their district but an electoral vote for someone else counts even though it may violate state law if the electoral vote is close there will be intense lobbying of the electors to switch sides electors have received death threats in the past no doubt some have been offered bribes as well this gives the impression that it would be very unusual but still real possibility my question is when was the last time if ever an elector was faithless in us presidential elections voted for someone else than the candidate who got the most votes in their state or district
5536 sometimes encounter accounts that the main reason why chemical weapons were not used in wwii was because initially they were invented by jew fritz haber and as such hitler expressed opinion that use of chemical weapons was inhumane and jewish method of warfare there were even some hints that the nazis made certain propaganda canpaigns against use of chemical weapons which involved wwi war veterans who suffered from gas attacks wonder whether it is true that the nazis regarded chemical weapons inhumane or was it only propaganda disguise

5592 via the straight dope came across this page which claims that lord jeffrey amherst commander in chief of the brits in america seriously considered distributing blankets infected with small pox to native americans you will do well to try to innoculate the indians by means of blanketts as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race should be very glad your scheme for hunting them down by dogs could take effect but england is at too great distance to think of that at present while it is not known if the plan was carried out or not is this the earliest known example of bacteriological warfare

5648 we know that modern olympics are very popular international sporting events what is the earliest known documented instance of an international sporting event let us define an international sports event as an event where teams or participants from different empires countries or far off regions within the same empire or country competed against each other far off is subjective but lets define it to mean distance large enough to prevent systematic movement of people on regular basis more regular than the event itself so gaul and italy would be far off regions in the same empire under the roman period
5672 it seems to me that east of italy germany all of europe was in the soviet sphere of influence with the blatant exception of greece im sure that the long coast made access to western influence easier assuming that western influence is what the greek hegemony of the time wanted but why was greek failure of soviet influence was greek success of western influence how much of this can be attributed to internal greek policy and culture birthplace of democracy edit the wikipedia article on greece glosses over the greek civil war but having found the page that describes the war in detail the answer to this question resides in there in short nato involvement and lots of dead greeks thanks to anixx for pointing me in the right direction
5676 for all these countries that the red army entered poland romania part of germany czechoslovakia hungary the procedure was straightforward once the soviets beat the germans they become de facto occupants and could establish government of their choice with bulgaria it was little bit different once it became clear that the red army offensive would enter their country local communists swiftly executed coup detat which was obviously not opposed by either the bulgarian public or the ussr even so they still went under soviet control in yugoslavia they had their own socialist government however since yugoslavia was independent from ussr as much as it is questionable if they were part of the eastern bloc they surely werent under ussr power like the rest albania had some similarities also being independent since albania was geographically separated from the eastern bloc in that it only bordered yugoslavia somehow it never occurred to me that the red army did enter yugoslavia and did take major part in liberating the capital in what were the reasons for completely withdrawing their troops and when did it happen it is so unlike stalin to do something like this he could leave at least few rear units and try to influence if not control the situation later this would repeat the usual scenario that had played out previously the west could object but surely they wouldnt bring their own troops to yugoslavia to escalate conflict especially since everyone was still facing the germans it seems that it is somewhat exceptional that yugoslavia was handled this way with respect to all the other countries where the red army dropped by

5747 what was palestine before if not country could you give me some history on this also the recent recognition of palestine as country in the un could have far reaching implications are there other examples of similar situations where the un has provided recognition in volatile region edit after reading the following answers it seems that any answer to the question what was palestine before necessarily includes information about who for some of you who means which religion or which race lived in the region at what times while it is completely fine to provide facts such as lived in the region during time or kicked out in so and so date it is not okay to make judgements about who belonged there and who was right or wrong if you want to take this route would suggest doing it on another thread the question here is not to discuss israel palestine conflict the question simply asks what was palestine before
5765 know the obvious answer to this question is for protection but would imagine that for wall to be justifiable in terms of costs attacks must have been fairly frequent if the attacks were so frequent what was there to protect farmers who would be working and living outside the city walls surely their job was of paramount importance or their wouldnt be any food for the city so how would this work heres photo of conwy in wales showing the walls surrounding the city as well as the fields surrounding it
5773 modern fiction is often filled with fantasy versions of the middle ages from lord of the rings to game of thrones and everything in between but how did the reality of this trope operate there obviously would have been farmers creating and selling produce in markets and blacksmiths fixing horses and making armour and weaponry but what about everyone else how did people afford to live realise there was no middle class in those days but the average person would have still owned home for example in 13th century city like conwy in wales what would the average person have done for money who lived within the city walls how did their version of capitalism operate to put it another way that might be easier to answer what would children have done with their day what would wives have done with their day what would husbands have done with their day and how would they afford to eat and live
5788 once saw documentary that discussed discovered possible round table but wondered how pie in the sky this possibility was as well as just how much how little evidence is there for any possibility of truth in the legend my daughter is just beginning study of the middle ages and we will be studying some of the legends in her related literature have done some research but feel as though im drowning in articles that seem too similar to each other that are vague at best hoped for either somewhat more knowledgeable answer to the question or couple of ideas for good resources or both know there isnt lot of evidence and if there is any truth to it it is most likely that king arthur is actually an amalgam of multiple men if pure myth how is that this character became such symbolic force in history to be touted as something more

5868 as beginning student of chinese am also learning bit more about chinese history as such am more and more impressed by the quality of thought that has been left behind by chinese philosophers from the hundred schools of thought period to bc during the era of warring states confucius bc laozi 6th century bce zhuangzi bc etc so many main lines of concemporary philosophic thought seemed to be alive and mature already at that remote time pre socratic and later hellenistic philosophy began in ancient greece also in 6th century with plato bc socrates bc aristotle bc epicurus bc zeno bc bc etc what do we know about possible historic influences from china on developments in greece or the other way around am aware of one book thomas mcevilley the shape of ancient thought comparative studies in greek and indian philosophies whose title and table of contents seem relevant to influences from india but have not read it yet would also be interested in historic influences for religious thought from buddhism say

5883 ive heard that in most battles prior to the introduction of gunpowder weapons the casualties were usually very low around even in long battles prior to the moment when someones formation was broken and the side stopped really fighting and just ran away or was fighting without the benefits of proper formation if the side couldnt retreat and that most people killed in battle were killed by the pursuing victorious force is it true is it matter of debate between historians is it basically true but exagerrated or is it considered myth

5925 have this romantic idea about the lost writings of epicurus that perhaps somewhere at the bottom of the aegean sea there still lies ship sunken in ancient greek times with copies of the philosophers writings stored in some waterproof amphorae or something like that maybe one day they will resurface as was the case with the antikythera wreck and mechanism or maybe they wont and the ship and its remaining contents will just dissolve into enlarging entropy personally would certainly welcome their discovery most dearly now my question is along similar lines but more concrete in terms of known history what were important instances of historic documents or other artifacts that were thought lost with the library of alexandria or that were inaccessible at the time in soviet russian archives and that led to significant new historic understanding when new developments occurred and copies became available perhaps surprisingly and are there trends over time that perhaps show that new such discoveries get rarer as possible sites become more fully explored or more frequent as historians technical ability to explore them enhances

5992 the wheat and chessboard fable describes geometric problem that is often quoted in stories about the invention of chess according to wikipedia the main theme of the fable is when the creator of the game of chess in some tellings an ancient indian mathematician in others legendary dravida vellalar named sessa or sissa showed his invention to the ruler of the country the ruler was so pleased that he gave the inventor the right to name his prize for the invention the man who was very wise asked the king this that for the first square of the chess board he would receive one grain of wheat in some tellings rice two for the second one four on the third one and so forth doubling the amount each time the ruler arithmetically unaware quickly accepted the inventors offer even getting offended by his perceived notion that the inventor was asking for such low price and ordered the treasurer to count and hand over the wheat to the inventor however when the treasurer took more than week to calculate the amount of wheat the ruler asked him for reason for his tardiness the treasurer then gave him the result of the calculation and explained that it would take more than all the assets of the kingdom to give the inventor the reward the story ends with the inventor becoming the new king in other variations of the story the king punishes the inventor in some variations wheat is replaced by rice what are the origins of the fable more specifically and since chances are the fable was passed down through oral tradition what are the earliest recorded instances of it
5999 id curious to know how and when the word diablo came to mean the devil in luc ferrys brief history of thought he states the devil is rather one who spiritually speaking does everything in his power to separate us dia bolos in greek meaning the who who divides from the vertical link uniting true believers with god and which alone saves them from solitude and death wiktionarys trail runs via latin ultimately to greek where its etymology reads from diaballo slander from dia across and ballo throw etymonlines entry provides little hint deofol evil spirit devil the devil false god diabolical person from diabolus also the source of it diavolo fr diable sp diablo ger teufel is tiufal from latin via goth diabaulus from ecclesiastical gk diabolos in jewish and christian use devil satan scriptural loan translation of heb satan in general use accuser slanderer from diaballein to slander attack lit throw across from dia across through ballein to throw see ballistics jerome re introduced satan in latin bibles and english translators have used both in different measures in vulgate as in greek diabolus and mon see demon were distinct but they have merged in english and other germanic languages but what does from ecclesiastical gk diabolos in jewish and christian use actually mean also was it imported by ecclesiastical greek when the word meant as ferry suggests the who who divides or the wiktionary meaning of slanderer or did the word already represent the devil by then also when did this happen

6074 recently ive read certain book about the middle ages that has been quite popular with laymen but is held in utter contempt by professional medievists in fact hadnt known the books reception history before finished reading it so approached it as tabula rasa now im no professional historian myself but do know few things here and there so spotted some of the glaring errors myself and of course missed some of the others one point which am almost certain is an error but would like to query you about is this the book asserted that villages were frequently innominate is it true that medieval villages didnt have names is there archival evidence with lists of villages or something like this

6106 mongols of khans time are generally considered to be cavalry army which makes sense logistically given the width and speed of their military maneuvers but is there historical evidence of khans mongol armies ever using infantry in any significant degree of given fighting force im mostly interested in timlines around gengis but pretty much anything till the time of kublai khan is fair game please note that im using narrow definition of infantry soldiers trained and equipped to fight primarily on foot they may have horses for movement but always primarily fight dismounted using infantry tactics im only including front line soldiers auxiliary engineering logistics and whatever equivalent of military police garrison troops inside the empire the mongols had do not count even if they were not cavalry non horsed archers are probably in scope but again only if they were explicitly meant to fight on foot as opposed to simply regular cavalry archers that were dismounted for accuracy at specific part of the battle depends on details inspired by this

6128 henrys story georgias ruling http classiclit about com library bl etexts ohenry bl ohenry georgia htm describes dire social problem related to the usa land laws and the land sharks when the state was young she felt the need of attract ing newcomers and of rewarding those pioneers already within her borders year after year she issued land scrip headrights bounties veteran donations confeder ates and to railroads irrigation companies colonies and tillers of the soil galore all required of the grantee was that he or it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district surveyor and the land thus appropriated became the property of him or it or his or its heirs and assigns forever in those days and here is where the trouble began the states domain was practically inexhaustible and the old surveyors with princely yea even western american liberality gave good measure and over flowing often the jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain mounted on pony that could cover something near vara at step with pocket compass to direct his course he would trot out survey by counting the beat of his ponys hoofs mark his corners and write out his field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed sometimes and who could blame the surveyor when the pony was feeling his oats he might step little higher and farther and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for but look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare however no one ever had to complain of the pony under stepping nearly every old survey in the state con tained an excess of land in later years when the state became more populous and land values increased this careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless litigation period of riotous land grabbing and no little bloodshed the land sharks voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain wherever the identi fications of the old tracts were vague and the corners were not to be clearly established the land office would recognize the newer locations as valid and issue title to the locators here was the greatest hardship to be found these old surveys taken from the pick of the land were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers and thus their titles were demolished and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land over at double price or to vacate it with their families and personal belongings immediately land locators sprang up by hundreds the country was held up and searched for vacancies at the point of compass hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of splendid acres were wrested from their innocent purchasers and holders there began vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons going nowhere cursing injustice stunned purposeless homeless hopeless their children began to look up to them for bread and cry does this actually describe the historic reality on one hand it is known that henry worked as draftsman in the general land office in texas so he probably had profound knowledge about the usa land laws on the other hand the situation he describes is so convoluted that find it hard to believe it really existed any information on this subject will be appreciated

6182 have read many times that the only way for europeans to get to china or vice versa was through anatolia and persia this gave istanbul an advantage in throttling trade as well as mesopotamia and locations in persia am sure that due to climate considerations those were the easiest routes but when those were blocked by unfriendly regimes why didnt trade or travel go north of the caspian and black seas through what today is called kazakhstan and ukraine is there reason that it was particularly difficult to go that way have never read about any significant traffic that way on the contrary it is usually stated that the only way to china was through persia

6250 was browsing the internet and came across the post which dictator killed the most people it seems that leopold had lot of people killed this got me thinking dont see for example heirs of hitler or related to him rule germany that would be absurd though in case of leopold his lineage is still the royal family currently in belgium how is this possible is it because they are not direct descendants or are these killings not comparable to other killings under dictators know the information saw is not from the history books and so on dont know lot about history normally im not even remotely interested in this stuff though this find very strange and intriguing if someone could shed some light and clarify what am missing
6256 find it quite diffucult to find reviews of academic books on various subjects especially for books in the english language in denmark we have service where we can search almost any book academic or regular and get references to reviews no such thing seems to exist internationally which find weird for example the book civilization in the west by mark kishlansky and others got from my university but cant find single review in any journals and therefore cant really get any perspective on its validity even though im sure its fine have searched the databases jstor web of knowledge historical abstracts american historical review english historical review and off course google to no avail the same is true with the book the greeks history culture and society by ian morris and others where can only find one review am doing something wrong or are reviews this sparse find it weird because both books are published by pearson which guess means they have substantial audience many thanks in advance
6259 one of my family relatives who lives in seville spain my family is from andalusian descent has sent me pictures of book she owns and has received from her mother my family claims that the book in question was passed from generation to generation within my family since the xv century the book is in bad shape and my relative doesnt feel comfortable moving it from the apartment where she lives or even turning pages to take pictures of it still convinced them to open it and take few pictures of the document include some examples below my first question is how can research where the escutcheon above is from what type of escutcheon is it my family says that the book talks about two individuals who my family claims to be our ancestors juan ez salgero alonso mez salgero their names can be seen on pages inside the book have pictures below from the stories my family remember the two individuals above fought along with ferdinand of aragon also known as fernando of antequera during the reconquista against the mulsim kingdom of granada and conquered antequera this story seems to be consistent with what the following page from the book where think the text in large character says cant understand the small text at the bottom la nobleza limpieza de juan nu ez salgero descendientes de los primeros ganadores de la ciudad de antequera where understand limpieza to refer to limpieza de sangre the text seems to say that juan ez salgero was of the nobility and of pure blood christian with no muslim or jewish ancestry and descendant of the individuals who conquered antequera in september back then ferdinand of aragon was not king yet he was crowned king of aragon in and winning this battle gave him the title ferdinand of antequera don fernando de antequera so this seems to be consistent with the story told by family relatives here is another picture of different page they took my second question am having hard time translating the text above to modern spanish for example the first sentence seems to say por estas preguntas se examinan los testigos en la xx que hacen juan ez alonso salgero where think xx is provin but dont know what that word means it looks like provincia but it would not make much sense considering the rest of the sentence also what does the rest of the text say what is boco my last questions more generally am interested in knowing what this book is all about for example what was the purpose of the exam and the witnesses from the last page above am trying to get my relatives who own the book to take more pictures but its not an easy task they dont seem to be willing to share it physically with anyone and dont seem resources to pay for professional historian know that history se is not the place to offer things like how much would document like this be worth but am interested in preservation personally would like to see it in museum or some other national repository of antiques but dont know how to best proceed what is the best thing or they can do if we want this book to be preserved
6265 this question has been confusing me for while was alexander the great greek or macedonian he was born in pella macedonia but is he considered greek did nationality and ethnicity mean different things at the time of the greeks as they do now or were they regarded the same this link says macedonians were ethnic greek while this one contradicts the former
6266 when was the term nationality first came into use how did ancient civilizations refer to themselves when we refer to ancient civilizations did they consider themselves nation in the modern sense and applied this to other civilizations saying he is of roman persian egyptian nationality or was it only reference to the cities people came from how and when did the term nationality develop to be is current form

7308 while researching the who first wrote about deafness question came across this bold claim on wikipedia sparta is often portrayed as being unique in this matter however there is considerable evidence that the killing of unwanted children was practiced in other greek regions including athens the quote of course refers to the primitive eugenics of the spartans their custom of throwing puny and deformed babies into chasm on mount taygetos is documented by various ancient writers including strabo and plutarch but that was sparta not athens wikipedia cites buxton for the claim by which imagine it means the paperback edition of richard buxtons from myth to reason studies in the development of greek thought that was first published in obviously dont have access to the book and couldnt find any other reference for the practise not being unique to sparta help
7345 emperor augustus ordered his army to subdue the germanic tribes in what is modern germany this was promptly achieved and by ad the romans controlled germany up to the river elba the romans were however betrayed and defeated in the battle of teutoburg forest in ad afterwards they abandoned the region and established the limes on the rhine and danube rivers the roman empire outlasted this defeat for half millennium why there was no further attempt at conquering the region
7360 recall in history class learning that the japanese could have attacked the ussr in the 1940s and potentially split stalins forces which presumably would have been more useful for the nazis than bringing the us into the war which would indicate that japan wasnt part of the axis in any real way at the same time after pearl harbour the nazis declared war on the us siding with the japanese indicating close relationship but again cannot imagine the japanese fitting into the aryan image if the russians didnt so did the nazis have relationship with imperial japan if not why are they always referred to as the axis
7372 in the bbc radio series the wild east the history of russia after the mongolian occupation is described as if all the bad things happend subsequently had been caused by the legacy of that era isnt there any positive legacy of the mongolian occupation in russia for example didnt the newly opened up trade route to the east benefit the economy of russia wasnt the cultural influence from the east one of the appeals of the russian music to the west european audiences in the early 20th century
7375 the structure of society and warfare were closely connected to each other in the feudal system the land belonged to the crown the king assigned it to lords in return for military service and in the case of war the lords had to come with an agreed upon number of troops from their own estates however this changed completely in the renaissance and early modern period the knights no longer ruled the fields for example the years war was fought nearly exclusively by mercenary armies as the war dragged along the kings were out of money and the mercenary armies sustained themselves by sacking or extorting cities late in the war the opposing armies did not fight much with each other they avoided another maneuvered around for years and many such armies lived off from what would be described today as protection racket how can it be that in this turbulent period of time the ruling class remained stable so that the enlightened absolutist monarchies what followed this time period were ruled mostly by the same families who were in power since the middle ages would have suspected that the kings and the hr emperor owned only small number of own troops and the biggest mercenary leaders could have risen to power what stood in their way why couldnt have tilly for example orchestrate coup similarly to what happened through modern times in south america or the middle east
7391 yes this of repeated tale was reported by the romans all the time but it sounds lot like rumor stuff the victors write about their former enemies they were so stupid they went into battle naked etc as historians we need to look at history with critical eye and should seek verification from multiple sources before making an firm conclusions so are there any non roman sources that mention celts going into battle naked any celtic records or oral histories artistic depictions etc

7409 after the defeat of the french fleet off the coast of egypt in napoleons army was cut off in far away and hostile country one year later after eluding the british fleet he made it safely to france some argue that he bought some british commanders while others discount this hypothesis and acknowledge mix of luck and courage on napoleons behalf in order to judge the likelihood of different scenarios it seems to me that we must know what level of surveillance he had to elude in his sail so what countermeasures did the british and their allies employ to prevent napoleon from leaving the middle east
7412 while havent read goldhagen or scholars with similar viewpoint directly frequently encounter the following argument that seems very goldhagenite to me the germans tried to murder jews up until the end of the war the trains went to the death camps even when the war was already being lost and more resources were needed for the war effort this clearly shows the german eliminationist antisemitism eliminationist antisemitism was defined by goldhagen in hitlers willing executioners one key feature would be that the germans were of one mind with hitler in terms of antisemitism this would explain the continuation of the murders late into the war now among other criticisms browning pointed out that the same willing executioners were as willing to kill handicapped or russian pow before the mass murder of the european jews began also he got the diverse ways in which german society was antisemitic wrong so to me eliminationist antisemitism is not plausible but what other explanations are there since goldhagens views are not widely shared assume other historians tried to answer this question why continue the killings until the brink of defeat those would be the answers im looking for in no way do want to deny that ordinary germans were willing executioners or that theres antisemitism entrenched in german society but think the actual history is more complicated than made out in the model of eliminationist antisemitism edit by for background on functionalist intetionalist see here

7484 standard ancient roman uniform consisted of tunic cloak and sandal type boots resulting in look like this now this is all very well for mediterranean climates but really cannot fathom how they got along with this clothing in northern europe germania britannia northern gaul etc was there another type of uniform more suitable to cold climates know there is theory that the temperatures were then higher than today but at least the article ive linked to talks about difference of degree celsius not enough to make one warm and cozy in tunic on cold north european winter day so what was the romans trick were they supermen or something

7522 it seems that in english older times it was expected for the king or monarch to lead the armies in battle my research suggests that this was the case in the 12th century in the civil war between king stephen and empress maud matilda her champion being robert of gloucester an half brother note that since she was never recognized as monarch she is mentioned only as combatant1 both king stephen and his son were on the battlefield his son dying there though note that his son was also never the monarch due to his premature demise who was the last english british monarch to be combatant who was the last english british monarch to die on the battlefield by combatant mean person operating close enough to the battlefield that they might be taken captive in the event of loss of battle monarch does not necessarily need to actually draw sword to be in that position but merely close enough to the battlefield that if it goes wrong they are in imminent danger of capture or execution death by battle wounds

7559 wikipedias page about monarchies states that they might have predetermined limits on the length of their tenure however reading the page there is no mention about any current monarchy who does that so do any current monarchy have such system either simple time limit or something more complex voluntary abdication doesnt count obviously if not are there any recent or ancient notable examples of monarchies with such rule
7601 would like to know if there are any documents telling us how common or if it even existed among people in polytheistic societies like ancient greece rome etc it was to believe that there is only one or no god in few so called historic movies ive seen situations in which character states that there are no gods id like to know if thats just fiction or people in the past really werent that sure about gods existence as thought so far
7630 bose had come to realize that gandhis doctrine of non violence was not doing much in forcing the british to retreat he went to germany to seek hitlers assistance in indias struggle for freedom was bose welcome in germany did hitler agree to support boses cause was there anything that hitler really did to help bose
7634 ve gathered that ancient greeks and romans watered their wine heavily up to water roman era talmudic sources speak of wine not being fit to drink until it had been watered although mixtures weaker than wine water ratios were not deemed suitable for ritual purposes why was this done was it to avoid getting drunk or was this the preferred flavor was the wine spiced ahem with intoxicants other than alcohol was wine stronger then but how do you get strengths greater than without distillation iirc the romans did have form of distillation through freezing was this so prevalent or was this way of making the water safe to drink but is alcohol content enough to make difference
7641 on february the vatican announced that pope benedict xvi would resign on february due to infirmity from advanced age earlier in the history few popes resigned similar way probably the most important being gregory xii who resigned in in order to end the time of the western schism but few of popes made it official that they automatically resign from their functions if they get imprisoned examples are pius vii in the times of napoleon wars and later pius xii during the world war ii my question is if any of the popes were in fact imprisoned by anybody in the time of their service as head of the catholic church dont count celestine who became imprisoned by boniface viii as it happened two years after he resigned by himself of being pope
7771 ive just been revisiting some quotes from dan qualyle for example believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy but that could change and we are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur mean they sound pretty devastating and hilarious depending on how you look at it maybe he just suffered from some linguistic disability his boss certainly knew how to write nice letters and was no real dummy otherwise jfk was also not in perfect health but still why did george bush put him on the ticket in the first place it seems as if he had not been an opponent in the primaries with another wing of the party firmly behind him and dont remember indiana being battleground state at the time so why the decision
7812 in the army something like of newly commissioned second lieutenants are promoted to first lieutenant around age perhaps of first lieutenants are promoted to captain ages and of captains are promoted to major around ages about half or slightly less of second lieutenants make it this far call it to make the numbers round only one out of four majors of the original group are promoted to lieutenant colonel by age half of the majors retire around that time at half pay the remaining one quarter serve out their careers as majors and are promoted to lieutenant colonel around age shortly before retirement for purposes of calculating their pensions this is form of social promotion half of the lieutenant colonels of the total are promoted naturally to colonel by age the remainder at the end of their careers half of the age colonels are promoted to general of the second lieutenants the remainder retire as colonels and do not receive final promotion of course we know that there is pyramid but why is it so much less steep up to the level of major than thereafter

7887 give me control of nations money and care not who makes its laws mayer amschel bauer rothschild this prominent international banker is commonly quoted this first did he actually say it second what was its context when and where was he and what other things did he say shortly before or after this if we know finally seeing as how this is likely his most notable quote did he ever reflect on it at later time shedding some light on it
7891 my understanding is that motorized infantry have greater combat value than standard infantry foot soldiers armed with rifles or perhaps machine guns over and above their greater mobility do the vehicles give motorized infantry better protection do the vehicles carry firepower over and above what their soldiers are carrying or do the soldiers carry heavier weapons because they are being transported
7901 know this is pretty sensitive question but would like to get an objective answer it is widely known that the jewish people were persecuted by hitlers regime and many of them died in the concentration camps but never feel like the numbers are exact from time to time see peoples documentation about the holocaust and the numbers are changing in wide range my problem is first of all there are the neo nazis who claim that the holocaust never happened ok that seems totally false second of all there are some soviet era and even some american claims about the numbers which are also looking falsified wouldnt wonder since there was war which was won and the winner always try to support their views especially the soviet data is not really reliable see some attempts to get clear picture for example david coles interviews in auschwitz he made low cost documentary on this subject in he seems to me little bit more reliable than some soviet era officiers or the neo nazi sources he claims that and it is pretty believable to me the germans mostly forced the jews to work and more of the jews died in poor conditions than in the gas chambers but since am not an historian cant really judge it so the point of the question is is there any normal objective source on this subject
7907 was reading this article and assuming the data provided by the website correct came to my mind as to how historically valid is the testimony of the life of jesus in the new testament is as the following statement was made in the conclusion for more than three centuries the christian church had no new testament not until the muratoriun canon did the christian church begin to compile new testament that resembles the one we have today this canon did not include the letter to the hebrews or those we know as james john and and peter exhibit it did include the wisdom of solomon now part of the catholic old testament and the apocalypse of peter no longer used the historical evolution of gospels is described in detail here and the detailed information about the new testament papyri is tabulated here thus can these gospel faithfully record the actual life of jesus in the way he lived and the things he claimed and believed this question is different from previously asked question since this question asks whether the gospels provide the exact glimpse on the life of jesus the way he lived as against the prior question which only questioned the authenticity of the gospel
7937 in pope john paul ii officially conceded that the earth was not stationary it revolved around the sun the time that took to be accepted galileo was right about the kind of relationship between the earth and the sun makes question about the reason was it political reaction by the pope to be more popular or symbolic reaction by the church to try to compensate its dark history or not real reaction that had not happened before because of churchs doubts
7961 toward the end of world war ii germany had to utilize non german soldiers some of them from occupied countries like poland and the ukraine at places like omaha beach normandy individual poles spontaneously defected particularly when spoken to by polish americans on the eastern front the germans managed to turn whole division or more of captured soviet soldiers under general vlasov into fighting for the germans against the soviet union were there cases of the allies seeking and receiving the defection of groups of soldiers recruited by the germans or japanese im excluding italians except when in german not italian uniform since italy itself was successfully turned by the allies ditto for vichy french soldiers in north africa unless in german uniform
7969 on 13th of march archbishop of buenos aires jorge mario bergoglio became new pope of catholic church he was born and raised in argentina with italian origins there are more than millions of argentinian citizens who have italian roots making it around of the country population they came to south america in different generations many of them during the great european immigration wave to argentina at the end of 19th century and the beginning of the 20th italian immigration was an important part of that as between italy was facing social and economic disturbances as for the overall reasons of immigrating to argentina articles linked above mention in the first place the open immigration politic of the argentinian officials who wanted to raise the country population checking constitution of argentina from well find there article the federal government shall encourage european immigration and shall not restrict limit or obstruct by taxation of any king the entrance into the argentine territory of foreigners coming to it for the purpose of engaging in the cultivation of the soil the improvement of industrial business or the introduction and teaching of arts and sciences but im pretty sure there had to be also particular reasons for italians to chose argentina which im not aware of where there any other reasons for the immigration of so many italians to argentina why did they chose this particular country
7975 in february the germans might have captured the fortress of verdun france quickly through an all out assault instead the german general falkenhayn initially elected to make an artillery attack on it without using lot of infantry his rationale was allegedly stated in his christmas memo to the kaiser some historians dispute this which was interpreted to mean that he wanted to attack city of sentimental value to france suck in as many french troops as he could kill as many as possible with artillery fire and bleed the french army to death capturing the fortress would be of secondary importance the end result was that the germans failed to capture the fortress and inflicted french casualties at rate of only slightly more than to versus to overall allied advantage meaning tactical defeat for germany in the german summer offensive fall blau started spectacularly with the capture of voronezh on the don by the left flank of the southern front by armored divisions if this armor had been sent southeast to stalingrad supported by an eastward advance of infantry the germans might have captured it by late july instead the germans sent the armor from voronezh due south for the caucasus oil fields this not only prevented them from using the armor to capture stalingrad but blocked the infantry advance of paulus sixth army the assault on stalingrad didnt begin until late august giving the soviets more time to reinforce the city why were the germans so dilatory on their attack on stalingrad were they trying to suck in soviet reinforcements to stalins city destroy them en masse and thereby weaken soviet forces to the north around moscow and south the caucasus

8017 in germany was able to enlist the support of roumania hungary the latter at the expense of the former and bulgaria in the balkans yugoslavia initially signed on with germany then soon switched sides and declared herself for the allies why did yugoslavia do this have recollection of difference of opinion between the minor seventeen year old king and his uncle the regent was this the real cause or were one or both men pawns in larger struggle
8019 actually know certain facts about this matter but am seeking guidance in interpreting these facts into theories theory economic the americans spent something like billion in money of the time to build the atomic bomb germany simply did not have that level of resources meaning that her initial lead in atomic understanding was moot like other areas tank production american economic power swamped germany even though germany had superior quality theory scientific the balance of scientific power was held by jewish scientists like einstein fermi his wife was jewish not fermi himself and bohr meaning that germany could have built the bomb if it had stayed on good terms with these people fermi and americas robert oppenheimer were referred to as the fathers of the atomic bomb einstein was the grandfather insofar his atomic theories paved the way for the others work bohr was notable for what he didnt do correct the mistakes of his former student germanys werner heisenberg do either theory alone or both theories together explain why america took the lead in atomic development are there other reasonable theories that may have missed am trying to check the validity of the comments made in answering this other question at the end of wwii were nazis working on any other super weapon besides
8022 the range of the medieval weapon is not accurately known with estimates from to to yds so says wikipedia did read however in semi fictional semi historical work of bernard cornwell that bows could fire and hit targets over further distance now unfortunately cannot find this quote but am looking for other quotes and or experiments that show better proof than wiki another thing that bothers me is that most sources say an archer could shoot this far but does that mean that he could shoot that far effectively or just that the arrow would land there in other words are the ranges that are mentioned the distance over which an average archer could hit target or not
8034 ive heard that there were two common methods to disinfecting water in the past boiling water or turning it into alcohol presumably those in the east relied on boiling water while those in the west relied on alcohol in the context of contaminated water supply ethyl alcohol may indeed have been mother milk to nascent western civilization beer and wine were free of pathogens and the antiseptic power of alcohol as well as the natural acidity of wine and beer killed many pathogens when the alcoholic drinks were diluted with the sullied water supply dating from the taming and conscious application of the fermentation process people of all ages in the west have therefore consumed beer and wine not water as their major daily thirst quenchers the experience in the east differed greatly for at least the past years the practice of boiling water usually for tea has created potable supply of nonalcoholic beverages in addition genetics played an important role in making asia avoid alcohol approximately half of all asian people lack an enzyme necessary for complete alcohol metabolism making the experience of drinking quite unpleasant thus beer and wine took their place as staples only in western societies and remained there until the end of the last century source what im interested in is how those societies functioned if they had to rely on alcohol as source of water as compared to societies that relied on boiling water was the alcohol thinned down was it used only as an emergency source of water if they had indeed relied on alcohol did those societies develop genetic immunity to alcohol intoxication did it have health effects as compared to societies that relied on boiling water or was it treated in manner similar to how modern societies drink carbonated water
8054 at the battle of zama which army had higher proportion of native troops within the context of this question consider troops to be either native or mercenary native troops serve out of allegiance while mercenary troops serve based on compensation the question arose because at dinner the other night someone remarked the romans won the battle of zama because most of their soldiers were native sons while most of the soldiers on the carthaginian side were mercenaries putting aside the question of whether or not this opinion was valid was the premise factually correct that is were most of the soldiers fighting for rome actuall pro roman and most of hannibals soldiers mercenaries consider the numidians pro roman in this regard they were fighting for king and country numidia allied with rome
8058 im curious about the mechanical aspects in the course of naval battle in the 17th century to explain better here are some questions whose answers would provide text answer explaining the course of battle what were the distances between the vessels did they have one single burst with all cannons or were they cadenced how long did it take from one burst to another if they were cadenced how long did battle take how much damage could vessel take for each of the common types in that age is there common number of vessels in fleet that is what is the number of vessels the one would commonly see in battle if there were number is all this related to territory that is battles were different in europe central america north america etc what else
8083 have moscow and beijing ever been cities under the rule of the same empire it should have been mongol empire suppose how long has it lasted
8084 russia today is the largest country in the world by fairly wide margin that is true after the other or so socialist republics left and went their separate ways in leaving russia with bit more than three quarters of the former soviet land area if physical size were the main determinant of power russia would not have lost all that much another measure of russias lost power is the decline of population here the loss was more serious because russia was left with only about half of the population of the former soviet union and todays russia seems to be shadow of its former soviet self so is one fourth based on land or one half based on population better rough guess of the decline in russian power when the soviet union broke up are there any other other measures of power gdp nuclear warheads troop strength nobel prize winners or any other relevant power source that might provide better estimate of russias loss
8090 as remember the 1980s and the perestroika epoch the reforms were advertised to the people as return to leninist principles even deeper implementation of socialism the posters claimed it was duty of every communist to be in the vanguard of the perestroika yet many russian internet sites claim that when speaking abroad gorbachev admitted that his aim was actually to combat communism for instance often cited his undated speech in american university in turkey with reference to slovak newspaper usvit no in the speech gorbachev makes some notable confessions the aim of the whole my life was the destruction of communism my wife understood the necessity of it even before me for this goal used my position in the party and in the country thats why she emphatically pushed me to occupy higher and higher positions in the party and government when myself accustomed with the west understood that cannot give up this aim in the speech he admits that he created conspiracy with yakovlev and shevardnadze in pursuit of this goal if the speech is true it would mean at least dishonest betrayal of his voters who voted for the return to leninist ideals as it was declared not to say of his party who trusted him and put in the highest position yet the speech very much resembles the confessions of the stalinist show trials of the 1930s where some higher officials confessed in wreckage conspiracies and plotting to restore capitalism so my question is whether the speech is authentic
8095 literacy in the early middle ages was very low but as recall by the time of reformation quite lot of commoners could read even if they were not very good in reading and writing by the 17th century many had copy of the bible they could read as well as pamphlets posted on important occasions etc how did they learn to read compulsory and state founded primary education emerged mostly after this period so who taught the peasants of 15th and 16th centuries how to read
8122 the new testament book of revelation starts with an image of the exalted jesus holding several stars in his hand read in commentary that there were coins at that time which showed roman emperors holding several stars in their hand according to the commentary the stars signified the global reach of the roman empire if that was the case the image in the book of revelation would have been highly political statement unfortunatly didnt find any images of such coins https commons wikimedia org wiki category stars on coins shows some coins where the roman emperor is on one side and star on the other but no coin like described above did such coins or other similar images exist
8126 apparently the decisive blow at the battle of vienna was struck by jan sobieski with only hussars cavalry this seems bit hard to believe given that the turkish army had about while hussars were the second worst form of cavalry above only cossacks was cossack cavalry ineffective relative to other troops but dragoons were supposedly twice as good as hussars and cuirassers twice as good again as dragoons so could sobieskis hussars actually been better troops in one of the two other categories its easier for me to imagine that the equivalent of or even hussars struck such decisive blow could sobieskis cavalry been elite troops armed with pistols and blade weapons meaning that they were actually worth more than their stated number if not what would have enabled relatively small number of troops to strike such decisive blow
8131 am certainly aware of japanese americans being detained in internment camps after the attack on pearl harbor and subsequent declaration of war on united states by the empire of japan about japanese american residents of the pacific coast were forced into relocating into areas designated as war relocation camps my question is why did the united states government not carry out the same policy against german americans another add on question might be how were german born newly emigratednaturalized citizen treated were they just ignored or was any measure taken to have close watch over them if not downright throw them in detainment camps edit to make my point clear that executive order was targeted mainly the japanese here is quote from this reference which echoes the proclamation made by president gerald ford in regard to executive order february 19th is the anniversary of sad day in american history it was on that date in in the midst of the response to the hostilities that began on december that executive order was issued subsequently enforced by the criminal penalties of statute enacted march resulting in the uprooting of loyal americans over one hundred thousand persons of japanese ancestry were removed from their homes detained in special camps and eventually relocated
8161 were tactics specifically aimed against horses common in past cavalry warfare and what forms did they take for instance did opponents try to harm poison or shoot them first distract loud noises or detract opposite sex horses in battle these then all important animals could it be said that breeds of horses were selected for their mental as much as physical stamina and how did people towards the end of the ages of cavalry warfare say train or equip war horses against specific hostile measures do imagine that in imperial times there must have been huge horse stables even during times of peace with lot of surrounding infrastructure including medical security etc

8170 as my favorite ice hockey team became the champion of poland today was reminded of the famous battle of the ice that took place in during the fights forces of alexander nevsky managed to draw teutonic knights to the frozen lake peipus where they started to slip and in consequence many of them drowned under the ice were there any other battles in history in which ice took such an important role dont mean the usual influence of winter conditions like during napoleons campaign or the eastern front during world war ii but the particular case of battle taking place on frozen river lake or sea both land and naval battles count
8175 until the industrial revolution china was mostly an advanced or at least state of the art country that is until it fell behind the west starting in the late 18th century recently china has been making great strides in the current information driven computer age this one might expect from the country that invented the abacus my feeling is that china fell behind the west because it didnt get the internal combustion engine is this true put another way did china sit out the industrial revolution from to dispute this theory please provide examples of how chinese engines were comparable in sophistication to similar western engines between and then explain why they didnt have the positive impact on chinese society as their western equivalents to support this theory please give concrete evidence of how china lagged behind western countries in the use of engines for instance until the year chinas consumption of oil key fuel for the internal combustion engine was 25th that of the on per capita basis and only small fraction of americas on an absolute basis even though chinas population was several times larger

8226 in the history of rome there are numerous instances of legions being marched up and down europe from spain to rome and from rome to syria im interested to know how quickly these armies could move did it take half year to move from the alps to rome or did it take week also how does that speed compare to the pace of the mobile cavalry reserve used to such great effect by the late roman emperors

8249 yugo south slavia is actually motley collection mixed bag in the american idiom of groups such as the serbs croats slovenes dalmatians macedonians bosnians and others during world war ii yugoslavia first signed on with the axis then switched to the allies leading to an invasion and occupation of the country by germans italians and hungarians were the different yugoslav groups more or less uniformly ambivalent between the axis and allies in this regard or did this ambivalence stem from the fact that some yugoslav groups favored the axis and others the allies with the end result being determined by the infighting between them put another way did the germans and italian occupiers regard some yugoslav groups as being more friendly collaborationist or hostile than others

8285 ive found that speaking of the first woman ruler in history most common materials like wikipedia or britannica point at the egyptian pharaoh hatshepsut living in the 16th century bce as source at wiki theres provided an american archaeologist james henry breasted who established the study of egyptology in the united states but he died around years ago so is that still accurate to our knowledge of ancient history who was the first woman ruler in history according to current scientific researches
8295 read somewhere that there were two best times for anti aircraft to shoot down dive bomber of world war ii vintage one was when the plane was going into the dive the other was when the plane is coming out of the dive the time not to try it would be during the dive itself was this true were there other reasonable times tactics for trying to shoot down dive bombers
8311 am interested in understanding something which have seen in the film 13th warrior where the vikings all use the same bowl of water to clean themselves http www youtube com watchv gkcslfsas30 it also happens in the tv show vikings no link am curious about few things all really only one question what exactly is going on is it really viking thing why are they doing it edit some clarrification am looking for information concerning whether this is real viking ceremony or custom in the 13th warrior the linked video there is no mention of this or why it is happening and as was pointed out is an actual account of some traveler however in the tv vikings no link there is hint that this is some sort of ceremony for either travelling or war or new ship

8339 noticed that in medieval movies and tv shows when there is big battle happening groups of archers always synchronize their firing was wondering whether this is something that writers made up and was eventually got picked up as how it was done or whether groups of archers actually did this the reason ask is because it doesn make any sense to me that archers would do that because they re only slowing themselves down when they could be firing as fast as they possibly can maybe there is something overlooking that someone can shed light on

8409 can we classify the holocaust as one of hitlers war time strategic mistake
8506 taylor in his book the origins of the second world war writes hitler never intended major war and at most was prepared for only limited war against poland in the last peacetime years germany spendt on armaments about percent of her gross national product the british proportion was almost exactly the same german expenditure on armaments was actually cut down after munich and remained on this lower level so that british production of aeroplanes for example was way ahead of germany by when the war broke out in germany had modern fighter planes and bombers great britain and france had fighters and bombers the german had tanks great britain and france had these numbers do not suggest that germany had planned and prepared great war that they started in one of hitlers generals keitel wrote in his diary about the german italian military talks in april which were initiated after italian pressure it turned out that the italians insisted on to tell that they could only be ready for war earlist in the german representatives agreed with them hitler attacked poland in september did hitler really intend limited war against poland what made hitler invade poland without expecting war like great warww1
8512 in germanys fall blau was initially aimed at capturing or interdicting shipments of oil from the caucasus to the rest of the soviet union even though armies were diverted to stalingrad and even leningrad the germans managed to capture maikop and came within miles of grozny where would the soviet union have gotten its oil from if germany instead had pursued and succeeded in an all out attempt on the caucasus perhaps army groups and would have moved in parallel to the lower volga bypassed stalingrad captured astrakhan on the caspian and move far enough beyond to interdict oil shipments or germany could have sent mansteins 11th army and hoths 4th army along with army group to the caucasus leaving paulus between the don and the volga for flank protection thereby capturing grozny and isolating baku early in the war the soviet union had moved hundreds of factories to the urals from soon to occupied territory to sverdlovsk and magnitogorsk my sense is that they would have had adequate though not ample supplies of oil to fight war from around the urals and east of moscow without the caucasus after all germany managed to continue fighting with only romanian oil supplies and beyond without them but one of my history teachers taught that without caucasus oil the soviet union would have had to make carthaginian peace could someone with knowledge of soviet geography tell whether or my teacher was right about the soviet unions ability to continue fighting world war ii without caucasus oil
8557 from the huns through the mongolians why were nomadic people from the east able to create such havoc in europe was it an endless first mover advantage with horse domestication was it higher protein diet relative to the more farm centric europeans why werent celts ostrogoths teutonic knights or slavs pushing east were europeans just wasting all their expansive energy on the crusades
8561 in the battle of the atlantic the germans lost almost of their submarines nearly two thirds sinking allied merchant ships and warships some these kills were accounted for by veteran captains or aces who had experience in world war while about two thirds of the submarines out of sank nothing one veteran world war submarine captain was an austrian named georg von trapp the whole focal point of the sound of music was whether or not captain von trapp would become germanys 31st submarine ace von trapp and his wife maria were real people and while the seven children existed they were fictionalized by the movie as being younger than they really were to allow maria to be their governess are there any historical accounts or naval doctrines that suggest that quality is more important than quantity in submarine warfare that is that more captain von trapps using the same or fewer ships would have been more useful to germany than more boats manned by random crewmen
8623 johannes blaskowitz was german general during ww2 he committed suicide in while being tried as war criminal his action during the polish offensive seem rather counter to this to quote wikipedia as traditional soldier blaskowitz kept firm control on the men under his command in their dealings with civilians blaskowitz was opposed to the army committing war crimes with the ss between november and february he wrote several memoranda to higher command in which he detailed ss atrocities in poland their effects on wehrmacht soldiers and the insolent attitude of the ss to the army however his protests produced no condemnations of such behavior and merely earned him the enmity of hans frank reinhard heydrich heinrich himmler and adolf hitler while chief of staff alfred jodl dismissed them as naive and uncalled for commander in chief walther von brauchitsch forwarded blaskowitzs first memorandum to hitler on november who launched tirade against blaskowitz denouncing his concerns about due process as childish and poured scorn on his salvation army attitude as result blaskowitz found himself placed on blacklist and he was relieved of his command on may robert kane disobedience and conspiracy in the german army mcfarland isbn kitchen martin the third reich charisma and community pearson education isbn so my question is was the justification for his inclusion in the nuremberg trials based on anything more than his rank in the german army because it seems to me he offered no more complicity than being in the german army and remaining in it with at least some knowledge of what was going on which seems bit of an expansive definition of war crime is there any evidence that he endorsed the ss actions and had some other non humanitarian for forbidding army troops from participating seems unlikely given his complaint letters or maybe there is evidence of disciplinary action taken by him against ss troops in the field
8680 article of the meiji consitution full text here says the imperial throne shall be succeeded to by imperial male descendants according to the provisions of the imperial house law history book was perusing indicated that this was break with previous japanese tradition and explains this by prussian german influence this explanation makes lot of sens since two prussian experts rudolf von gneist and lorenz von stein were helping with the drafts however the japanese did reject some european notions they didnt want in their constitution wiki article drafting section ito hirobuni chair of the drafting commission also rejected some notions as unfit for japan as they stemmed from european constitutional practice and christianity so id like to know if there was some internal debate on this point in which some japanese upheld the traditional approach which allowed for ruling empress and why did the german salic approach prevail

8741 in what times and places was it common to give land to soldiers as form of payment for their army service have learned in school that this was common in rome however in the wikipedia article about tiberius gracchus around bc they say that since legionaries were required to serve in complete campaign no matter how long it was soldiers often left their farms in the hands of wives and children small farms in this situation often went bankrupt and were bought up by the wealthy upper class forming huge private estates it seems that these legionaries didnt get land as compensation for their service did this practice begin later on
8753 ive read that in economic crisis was taking back and that its the war effort that finally closed the crisis is it not version of the parable of the broken window how war effort could be good for the economy because as the parable says spending money in war is the same for the gdp than spending money in other things but the last is better for the welfare of people

8768 recent interview by span host brian lamb with washington post staff writer rajiv chandrasekaran touched on many controversial issues of the acquisition program where evidently lot of pork is cut and political favors are passed around one gets the sense that it all started out with the sensible idea of building single fighter plane platform for three services the navy air force and marine corps but then reality intervened on costs at some point they quote an army officer as asking why does the navy army the marine corps need its own air force why indeed and why does the military maintain separate marine service in the first place and evidently in between the army and navy and the air force as well were there all important events in history where the or another nations marines saved the day or are there other understood reasons for the existence of four instead of three service branches and allocation of funding to the tune of planes for the marines in the military

8814 in the soviet army during ww2 the officers had bigger food rations they also had better boots kirza vs leather the air force pilots were fed even better but that is not very relevant what about other modern in the last say years armies which armies and when fed and clothed their personnel similarly which armies and when separated officers and enlisted mens messes obviously pilots or submariners are equipped differently than cavalrymen the question is about people who serve together platoon leader and his men but are supplied differently obviously in the field during rapid advance retreat or when encircled an army might not be supplied according to the regulations the question is specifically about regulations and normal practice not emergencies
8860 how long did it take to build various siege engines understand this can vary widely based on the size of the engine etc but id be interested in somewhat average values lets say stationary trebuchet normal siege tower and ballista what would be the time man hours or something to build each of these im primarily interested in the early middle ages but ancient time or renaissance answers are also welcome
8870 update want to know whether there is any evidence that rowers were ever chained to the ships or oars in ancient greece and rome in my view it could be too expensive to chain people at that time even if the crew were slaves in many historical paintings one can see slave rowers chained to the ships wonder whether this practice was indeed widespread were the chains permanent or allowed quick disconnection were the rowers allowed to walk in port when the ship was staying long time or was reloaded or were they used to help reloading how would they go to toilet if the chains were permanent was serving on ship normal slavery or was it kind of punishment
8877 historians rapidly come up against absence sources the documentary record of the past is by its nature fragmentary selective partial and obtuse what strategies do historians use when there are absences in solid consistent record series with diverse bases in diverse bases with inconsistent series in consistent series with serious selectivity or partiality issues in inconsistent and partial series with singular textual evidence with singular evidence which is obviously textual but which cannot be read when there are no documentary records of the past
8880 history is discipline in the academy that is sometimes social science and sometimes humanity however there are many other social sciences economics political science and many other humanities anthropology theology what differentiates history from its close relatives in the social sciences and humanities how can we tell that something is history and not archaeology how can we tell that something is economics and not history do other disciplines use historical methodology does this alone make them historians

8894 for novel im writing im looking for symbol akin to hammer and sickle that would represent socialist republic created in florida plus but of alabama and surrounding states the hammer in the communist symbol represents industrial workers while the sickle represents peasants so dont know if at the beginning of the xx century they would mean much in that area what do you think could be the right symbol gun and scythe any help will be appreciated and obviously acknowledged in the novel when published update to make the question more general how do in general revolutionary countries adapt symbols to their peculiarities given that the hammer and sickle are symbol of the russian revolution and have as origin the two worker classes factory and farm that joined to take the revolution to vistory update finally adapted the west florida flag adding an angolan machete in maroon which accounts for the cimarr origin of many of the natives check it out here thanks lot for the contributions it will duly be acknowledged in the book
8955 in essence im asking about whether there are any historical inaccuracies in the movies plays themselves im pretty sure the book would have very few due to the fact that it was written in similar time but what about in the movies plays
8966 in anne applebaums recent book iron curtain the crushing of eastern europe she claims the ussr supported the new state of israel and states stalin believed israel would quickly join the communist camp she doesnt cite any references for this but is it true and if so what grounds were there for stalin believing israel would align itself with the soviet union
9012 im interested in battles that were won by much weaker side or even lost by it but for example making the stronger side to keep fight against this weaker force and thus providing it strategic victory this might be by high morale skills of the defending commander of course also brave attacks of the weaker side are also accepted or last not least just luck would like not to take into account battles where weaker side was equipped in some devastating weapon say two tanks against million of spear men so eg conquest of peru ca with spanish having muskets and horses is not accepted im also not interested in heroic suicides that were clueless and achieve nothing but great remembrance in national poetry like massada ca or both warsaw uprisings and from my first research the most known are battle of thermopylae bc where spartans kept resistance against much larger persian army being defeated eventually but allowing other greek forces to prepare to fight battle of cr cy and similar battle of agincourt where english forces being outnumbered ca won with minimal losses having better weaponry and combined with terrain advantages siege of rhodes where knights hospitaller stood to much larger ottoman army being outnumbered at least times battle of kircholm where outnumbered polish hussars ca destroyed swedish forces having minimal losses rorkes drift where the weaker side was better armed than stronger one but in this case it was also high morale of defenders and use of available terrain east africa campaign ww1 where combined german and native askaris troops managed to keep attention of large allied forces during the war surrendering few days after the armistice being the german longest fighting unit cruisers of german empire like emden and dresden in ww1 too binding some part of royal navy for long time these pointed by me are the most popular in culture are there any less known but in which the weaker side should be honored for its bravery

9059 in other words how significant was american lend lease in helping the soviet front would the soviets be suffering lot more had lend lease not happen or was it not as significant as people make out
9060 there are some arguments that spain over exploited the precious metal deposits of the new world leading to wide scale inflation this coupled with their expulsion of jewish money lenders caused their economy to collapse am confused as to how this happened or were the reasons that the spanish empire collapsed unrelated to the wealth they got am mainly confused as to how spain with access to the wealth of an entire continent failed to simply dominate the entirety of europe and could not even deal with the barbary pirates raiding her shores
9102 in the many colonies of the british empire it seems that the rulers of some were known as governors general and others were officially titled as viceroys was there practical distinction between the two titles or are these really two names for the same position im focusing on the period from ad or so
9108 from ad the mississippian native americans had massive city near the present site of st louis mo it was one of the worlds largest cities at the time and was the largest pre columbian city north of the aztec civilization with population of about people but by ad before any european settlers ever stepped foot on the continent it died out completely my question is why was the city of cahokia ultimately abandoned
9156 many far flung garrisons and especially islands were still in german hands at the end of the war in may parts of crete dunkirk the channel islands la rochelle st nazaire and several other french ports many other greek islands to name just few such territories clearly part of the reason lies in hitlers obsession with holding on to territory beyond the dictates of military logic but not consistently other islands such as corsica were let go without struggle and part of the reason lies in the allies sweeping all before them in battle being happy to bypass these garrisons there are almost no equivalents in when the situation was very broadly speaking reversed can only think of malta as an example you might think there were numerous islands in dalmatia norway even denmark and certainly the aegean which could have been supplied from egypt which could have held out of course there were mountainous areas of greece and yugoslavia which gradually became free of axis control but none of them seem to have held out from the beginning why the difference why didnt anyone try very hard in to hold out and equally why werent the germans happy to bypass garrisons as the allies were three years later
9159 on june there was near mutiny on the armored cruiser georgios averof while she was undergoing repairs after running aground at spithead near portsmouth uk wikipedia alleges the reason was the greek sailors unfamiliarity with blue cheese that their english hosts presumably served them without providing any sources the greek version of the article doesnt provide reason at all and random greek blog ive found alleges the reason was the fact that she run aground in any case the near mutiny lead to the immediate replacement of her captain by the more experienced and capable pavlos kountouriotis the blue cheese story sounds plausible and so does the alternative explanation that the crew didnt enjoy having captain that run the ship aground on her maiden voyage and only three days after he took command in fact both stories may very well be true but cant seem to be able to find any reliable sources for what actually happened my searches are hindered by the fact that there was another mutiny on the averof in april although wikipedia surprisingly only mentions the event in passing greek sources emphasize it to the point that every possible combination of search terms could think of results in documents about the event help
9165 during the 16th and 17th centuries there were many religious wars in europe in countries were it was very close to rome like spain portugal austria italian states they did not occur in northern europe scandinavia were it was far from rome or it head also political reasons the netherlands the protestantism was accepted relatively quickly however in the middle countries like german states france in some part bohemia and hungary and of course england and scotland the reformation was not quickly accepted rejected but some wars or fightings occurred in poland and lithuania which is geographically in the same position as germany no wars happened this is somehow strange as many polish people were protestant and many catholic sources claim that poland was very tolerant example whkmla the majority of polands nobility had converted to protestantism polands tolerance policy attracted those who were persecuted because of their confession from the netherlands france silesia the same is on the official site of republic of poland but this might be kind of propaganda in the 15th and 16th centuries poland was country open to new religious trends unlike other european countries there were no religious wars here not only could heterodox religionists find sanctuary here they were also protected by the kings and lords of poland as result culture and scholarship experienced an influx of new ideas and literary works building up an image of poland as country of toleration this was particularly true as regards the warsaw compact ratified in which gave protestants equal rights with catholics the last jagiellonian monarch zygmunt august sigismundus augustus said in sejm do not rule your consciences not surprisingly contemporaries and later generations called the jagiellonian era especially the 16th century their golden age and what would be post without citing wikipedia here it is the 16th century commonwealth was unique in europe because of widespread tolerance confirmed by the warsaw confederation in the brest bible was published the period of tolerance ended during the reign of king sigismund iii vasa who was under strong influence of piotr skarga and other jesuits the sigismundus iii vasas reign was also strongly influenced by his swedish claims and considered protestant rulers of sweden illegal this however had no impact on polish common tolerance policy my question is where did this religious tolerance come from why were there no fightings in this multi religion state my assumption is that the commonwealth was since its existence multi cultural country there were polish lithuanians ukrainians germans jews etc there were catholics orthodox and jews who probably made good businesses with one another helping them to find common factors so when protestants came they were just another group of many or referring to good business it was just not profitable for anyone
9177 hitler committed suicide in but im curious as to what would have happened to him if he hadnt did the allies have any formal plans as to what they would do with hitler if they caught him alive moreover did the allies agree on this plan or would his ultimate fate have depended on which country caught him
9221 as ships bow is designed to break the waves the physics something like hydrokinetics makes it should look like wedge and it really is if we look from above this should be also kept if look from side this is picture of the bow of modern ship lets call it shape wikipedia has also different kinds of bows on this picture but all are very similiar looking at warships bow during historic eras we can notice that shapes have changed this trireme bow was designed to operate as ram and destroy enemys ships caravel was not intended to touch other ships so her bow is physically correct hms africa which fought in the battle of trafalgar had normal bow too but in 19th century and early 20th the ships bow was again looking like the one of the trireme but more shaped having keel longer than the deck german postcard comparing losses during the battle of jutland think however it is not as long as in ancient galleys the rms titanic did not have ram as she was civilian ship then again in ww2 and later we go back to correct shape for example uss missouri modern uss bainbridge and my question is what was the reason of shaped bows in 19th century and ww1 was it the same as ram in ancient galleys why did everybody expect to ram enemys ship were there any successful attempts in the age of heavy naval artillery
9233 what did the spanish american war look like from spains perspective did the general population support the war what were the reasons why spain lost was the general public aware of these reasons during after the war and what did they do about them thanks
9234 what caused the gradual decline of the spanish colonial empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries post read claimed that the spanish overestimated their wealth and my teacher pointed out to me that nobody liked them to what extent are these claims true and what were some other reasons thanks
9247 how is it that france emerged from world war ii with similar status as the britain the soviet union and china in terms of possession of permanent seat on the security council uncontested possession of nuclear weapons etc understand that charles de gaulle somehow managed to downplay his beloved home countrys status as an early victim to german aggression in world war ii and line it up among the victors instead is this the case and if so how at what conferences did he pull it off this is not to diminish the role of the french resistance and de gaulles own contribution in that regard but its role in defeating germany seems hardly at the same level as those from the other allies overall perhaps excluding china update the following quote from andrew roberts masters and commanders how four titans won the war in the west seems pertinent when soon after its inspection the free french leader charles de gaulle demanded that france should have seat on the combined chiefs of staff ismay replied that if canada new zealand holland belgium denmark and norway also had the right to be represented the only place we could have meeting is the albert hall
9264 edit text in bold was added later to not suggest that this practice was common id known from stories told by my grandmother and other people of her age that after entering pre war polish territories some soviet soldiers plundered everything but what they liked most were handwatches this was what they wanted at first think this is good source few weeks ago was talking with person who lived in polish silesia she said they did not plunder anything from common people they stole some furniture from town hall and machines from local factory did not rape women but took all watches this is picture of two soviet soldiers putting flag on the reichstag in berlin this was redrawn as on the original picture the soldier quite high rank think had watches on both hands this correction suggests that red army knew the problem and could be somewhat ashamed why were some soviet soldiers so fond of handwatches why were they soviet most desired booty can see three reasons first there were no watches in the ussr why secondly just because it was easy to bear third this was some kind of fashion please note dont want in any way suggest that this practice was common in all occupied territories and by every soldier believe that soldiers who died fighting nazis were mostly good people
9288 first of all let me clarify that am not talking about inns which were located on the roads between major cities am talking about real restaurants inside the cities gave this some thought and think that restaurants couldnt be more than few hundred years old this is because restaurants had to have come after the rise of the middle class before then the poor wouldnt have enough money and the rich probably had their own chefs know that now it is different but few hundred years ago the primary reason why people would go to restaurants would have probably been if they just came from work and they had no food in the house even if there was middle class they probably wouldnt go just to have fun since they were still poorer on average than the middle class today this would imply that they are single since the wife would usually stay at home and cook since virtually all the people in the past were either married or lived with their family believe that the invention of restaurants was also synchronized with rise in the amount of single people which is fairly recent history am right and if not what is the correct timeline here thanks
9301 all histories of the stalingrad battle emphasize the heroic defense of the west bank of the volga by the red army in it implies that if the german 6th army had just managed to oust the last desperate defenders then by controlling the west bank they would have controlled the city and been able to declare some kind of victory at stalingrad and change the course of the war no doubt the russians holding on were fighting incredibly bravely and presumably their prolonged defence of the west bank bogged the 6th army down in war of attrition which damaged the germans cause but what if anything would have changed if the germans had taken the whole of the west bank other than small morale boost they would still have only held half the city my knowledge of the geography of stalingrad is hazy but most cities which straddle river have substantial portion on either side they would still have had over extended supply lines and been exhausted and under constant attack from the opposite bank most importantly operation uranus would surely have gone ahead in just the same way with the same final outcome so did it matter that the red army clung on to that small part of the city and if not why is such big deal made of it
9309 did any of the great powers reach out to try and resolve the conflict before the central powers surrendered in not counting the treaty of brest litovsk of course because that didnt end the war as whole
9424 it is quite common knowledge that longbows most likely did not penetrate the plate armor worn by the french chevaliers at poitiers and agincourt however how effective were these longbows in hampering the fighting ability of the french foot knights when they reached the english lines indeed at poitiers peter hoskins in in the steps of the black prince insinuates that the battle was won by anglo gascon discipline nco experience and french incompetence but not the english archers however did the longbow archers play big part by disrupting their foes formations wounding soldiers and making it harder to swing with arrows lodged in your armor
9429 reading comment made on this site saw something very curious why not blame it on the ancient hindu belief that traveling overseas pollutes person irredeemably thereby stunting the growth of indian naval technology and ensuring europeans came to india rather than vice versa searching on google find quite few people debating whether there are current rules against overseas travel or what the penalties are but havent been able to find anything about this belief in ancient days know that hinduism did spread to indonesia at one point so imagine there was no prohibition against overseas travel in those days so to be more specific when did hinduism first prohibit overseas travel and when did it stop prohibiting overseas travel
9436 after world war ii though the attlee led british government decided to give freedom to india they held on to much of africa but why did this attempt at colonization fail wikipedia explains that the economy of africa did not improve but what were the reasons behind this as in any history of colonization expect resistance of the local people to be an important reason but africa had at the time of british rule very small middle class and thus few political leaders so why did the british and other european powers fail to continue their rule
9457 after unifying castile leon navarre and aragon through marriage ferdinand proceeded to conquer the emirate of granada and almost unify the iberian peninsula but left portugal alone is there any satisfying reason why he did this possible reasons that ive thought of include reluctance to attack another catholic country or language barrier however both of these seem unlikely as each of the other four kingdoms had its own language what we now call spanish is the castilian language and prior to reunification fought amongst each other frequently
9463 during world wars and ii many countries managed to stay neutral like spain and switzerland was there any major country not city state or micronation that did the same during the napoleonic wars
9480 some defenders of the torahs historical accuracy respond to lack of evidence for the exodus from egypt with the claim that egypt simply didnt make records of its negative events for example rabbi dovid gottlieb from ohr somayach yeshiva says emphasis is theirs why is it that no ancient egyptian records mention the exodus the answer is that the egyptians never recorded their defeats is this claim true can anyone cite an example of the ancient lets say from the era of bce recording defeat suffered in battle are the only records of egyptian losss from non egyptian records
9517 when was in school in romania remember my history teacher saying that historically romania has seen lot of invaders referring mainly from the middle ages present because it used to have lot of natural resources to what extent is this true know that hitler used to get part of his oil from city in romania called constanta and right now there is controversy in romania because canadian firm wants to purchase the rights to very large gold mine but historically was romania invaded for its natural resources if not then for what reasons realize that this last question is very general so dont mind very general answer such as usually to expand territory thanks
9561 instead of accepting too much of what have read in my textbooks have read up bit about ww2 on my own and have always pondered why in the usa is the brutality and actions of the japanese during ww2 always downplayed compared with the brutalities and actions of the nazis in school remember the only thing we were taught about the japanese was that they attacked pearl harbor and then the americans dropped the bomb to end the war before that and after that it has always been nazis this and nazis that we learned everything about concentration camps luftwaffe kristallnacht and every school child has seen schindlers list and read anne franks diary our textbooks and teachers didnt spend nearly the same amount of time talking about the japanese if you are lucky you may hear bit about japanese internment camps and maybe get to read farewell to manzanar is this due to some cultural attitude if the usa had no front with the japanese that would make sense but the japanese did attack pearl harbor which was bad enough to force usa to join ww2 directly then the usa paid the same amount of attention resources to both fronts as far as can tell its not like the americans only focused on the nazis during the war so why are the history books so biased from what can tell the brutality of the japanese was on par with the nazis if not more they had just as grand plans to rule half of the world the bombing of japan disarmament and dismantling of its military and such strong presence of americans still to this day in japan like okinawa makes this even more perplexing an annoying side effect of this is having to explain to people that japan wasnt exactly nice in the war the most recent argument was with friend who thinks it would have been perfectly ethical to bomb germans but it was perfectly unethical to bomb the japanese the way the japanese people have turned themselves around in the past years their pacifism high morals and ethics and such emphasis on honor intellectualism respect and high regard for fellow human being makes my explanations seem even more incredulous know this is rather local question american history textbooks and am new here not too familiar with this forums nuisances if this isnt appropriate or if this question can be bettered please let me know and will fix remove it and btw am only talking about public school education until grade everything about the japanese and the nazis is out there but its just that in school nazis are given much more focus for some reason hope this isnt some weird perception error on my part thanks
9639 between 24th june and 12th may land routes into west berlin were blocked by soviet forces and west berliners were supplied entirely by air the famous berlin airlift no one connected with the soviet authorities had thought berlin could be supplied this way but contrary to expectations the airlift was an astonishing logistical succcess eventually bringing in supplies at rate which exceeded what had been provided by road and rail prior to the crisis so although because it wasnt working is the flippant answer to my question that doesnt explain soviet thinking while the blockade was clearly failure from the soviet point of view at the same time it seemingly cost nothing to maintain it was success for the western allies and glorious one but its costs were high wikipedias article only suggests that humiliation forced the soviets to lift the blockade but surely ending the blockade and admitting their defeat was humiliating in its own right why not just impose the blockade indefinitely airlift or no airlift did the blockade impose costs on the eastern bloc which arent immediately apparent damage to goodwill both inside germany and in the wider world trade costs were there economic levers which the western allies were able to apply quietly to help end the blockade
9644 met shocking for me information that germany and poland have not signed peace treaty after the world war ii because could not believe this performed some research in the potsdam agreement the three heads of government reaffirm their opinion that the final delimitation of the western frontier of poland should await the peace settlement the three heads of government agree that pending the final determination of polands western frontier the former german territories cast of line running from the baltic sea immediately west of swinamunde and thence along the oder river to the confluence of the western neisse river and along the western neisse to the czechoslovak frontier shall be under the administration of the polish state and for such purposes should not be considered as part of the soviet zone of occupation in germany this was however not signed neither by germany nor poland the similar question was asked on wiki answers com basically formal state of war existed between germany and the various allied nations until about although obviously all combat operations had ended many years previously by stalin was dead the german government reorganized east and west and the german economy stabilized and growing pows both german and japanese were just being released about this time in large numbers by the soviets although ive never seen full reckoning suspect some nations never actually signed treaty ending the war with germany for examples perhaps brazil or costa rica treaty between the main allies and germany was signed on september just before the re unification of germany this was essential in order to make germanys new frontiers definitive it was agreed between the four main allies on the one hand and the two german states on the other with the proviso that it wouldnt become fully effective unless ratified by the new united germany this treaty is regarded by germans as equivalent to peace treaty comprehensive treaty would raise all kinds of problems in respect of countries that were british and french colonies in ww2 but are now independent already in the allies issued solemn statement to the effect that they were no longer at war with germany poland and east germany were vassal states of the soviet union and we can consider also in this subject west germany as puppet of the usa soviet union had no problem if they had no peace treaty because she controlled them both ussr however did see below but in poland was no more soviet bloc member and signed border treaty with federal republic of germany source article the contracting parties reaffirm the frontier between them whose course is defined in the agreement between the polish republic and the german democratic republic concerning the demarcation of the established and existing polish german state frontier of july and agreements concluded with view to implementing and supplementing the agreement instrument confirming the demarcation of the state frontier between poland and germany of january agreement between the polish peoples republic and the german democratic republic regarding the delimitation of the sea areas in the oder bay of may as well as the agreement between the polish peoples republic and the federal republic of germany concerning the basis for normalization of their mutual relations of december this is not peace treaty so looked for documents mentioned there the treaty of zgorzelec the one between poland and the ddr was worded as declaration and was not recognised as legitimate international treaty by west germany insisting on its exclusive mandate and the members states of the nato four years later when the soviet union granted east germany independence the soviet union reserved rights over east germany similar to the rights reserved by the western allies over the west germany under the bonn paris conventions pending final peace treaty with germany the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany so although the treaty was binding on the two states it was not seen by many western members of the international community as definitive the treaty of warsaw the one between poland and brd in the treaty both sides committed themselves to nonviolence and accepted the existing border the oder neisse line imposed on germany by the allied powers at the potsdam conference following the end of world war ii at the time the treaty was signed it was not seen as the last word on the polish border in west germany because article iv of this treaty stated that previous treaties like the potsdam agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement so the provisions of this treaty could be changed by final peace treaty between germany and the allies of world war ii as provided for in the potsdam agreement as understand there really was no document between poland and germany that bore the name peace treaty however it seems there were no direct peace treaty with anybody else should then agreement be considered as peace treaty of ww2
9697 alans huns magyars mongols they were all pastoralists whose material culture and economic life seems more suited to the asian steppes yet for some reason they migrated into the european land mass and settled into farming why is this the case
9698 was reading the wikipedia entry for the war of the bavarian succession and it said my emphasis for some historians the war of the bavarian succession was the last of the old style cabinet wars kabinettskriege of the ancien gime in which troops maneuvered while diplomats traveled between capitals to resolve their monarchs complaints am curious about the emphasized information how long did it take to travel for example between berlin and vienna for diplomat what mode of travel was likely taken by diplomat it seems to be high ranking position so maybe they took the convenient but not fastest mode of transportation imagine it was very difficult to conduct diplomacy when it takes days or weeks to send diplomats and get feedback
9760 modern media seems to portray joan of arc as very attractive girl dont quite buy this interpretation of her as it would also suggest plenty of suitors and could be counter productive in camp full of men frustrated at the state of their country so was joan of arc really as attractive as modern media suggests or was she just plain peasant girl who managed to uplift country
9761 these areas have always been german in fact pomerania and brandenburg were both part of prussia since the 1700s why did the soviet union do this and how did the victorious powers justify taking these very german areas away to form poland bear in mind that when borders shift in europe the shifter usually has some sort of usually weak justification like danzig being former part of poland lithuania and alsace lorraine being part of the hre before however dont think east pomerania and east brandenburg was ever polish although silesia had polish minority how were these territories acquired in ww1 german territories were readily carved up by the treaty of versailles what was the treaty in question after ww2
9769 india was ruled by muslims from around the 12th century until and then by the british till however india still has large number of hindus countries like indonesia afghanistan malaysia now have islam as the dominant religion many countries in africa that were ruled by europeans have more christians than followers of any other religion given that indians were ruled by muslims or christians for centuries why werent the hindus converted to islam or christianity
9777 how did king henry viii get this disease when syphilis was disease originating from the americas
9785 most eastern european states had some form of revolt or another against the soviet regime hungary czech republic and polish strikes however there was no major uprising in east germany presumably because of the large number of soviet soldiers stationed there and germany threw out honecker after the czechs hungarians and poles were germans really just more acquiescing of the soviet domination or was this public order solely to do with the large number of soviet troops in the area ask because even today there are still lingering sentiments of russophobia in hungarians and especially poles but an east german would be apathetic
9802 are there any sources or reports which explain how close the country was to collapsing under the nazi assault by collapse mean completely lacking either the willpower as seen by france in after the fall of paris and the collapse of the line on the somme or ability as seen by poland as they ran out of territory to defend such that they would not be able to amount any effective defense and need to sue for peace as soon as possible

9847 what factors lead to the disappearance of military helmets from european armies during the 17th through 19th centuries and then to their return to use in the early 20th century to what extent were these reasons technical as compared to stylistic or fashion and were other factors involved as well for example during the napoleonic period shakos bearskins and similar headgear were the most common while to years earlier the thirty years war and eighty years war helmets were commonly worn by pike men and musketeers edit in addition does anyone have rough dates as to when the helmet re appeared in european armies
9850 the bayonet was introduced in the late 17th century as knife later short sword attached to musket to enable the musketeer to protect himself when reloading their single shot weapons as such it was something of an adjunct weapon to the gun itself http en wikipedia org wiki bayonet anti cavalry tactics in the late 18th early 19th century often consisted of musketeers with bayonets forming square to resist cavalry charges these resistances often succeeded whereas during earlier periods such as the middle ages soldiers armed with pole weapons such as spears were usually at disadvantage versus cavalry unless there were compensating features such as rough ground or bad weather even though these were their primary weapons what gave soldiers with bayonets and muskets their effectiveness did the one volley of musket fire sufficiently disorganize the cavalry to give the bayoneters their advantage did the presence of muskets force change in cavalry tactics the removal of armor that favored the musketeer were they just better drilled soldiers than the spear carriers
9885 in oceans towards the end of the movie in the famous scene where night fox is dodging the laser field to steal the fake coronation egg at the museum we see this statue in the foreground my question is what is this statue or rather or who is this statue of it seems like famous classical greek figure maybe even mythological figure the figure is beautifully haunting and has been bugging me ever since first saw it in the movie the clip is in hd here with the statue showing up for few seconds starting at this is not movie question but rather question regarding piece of art of classical antiquity thats why am posting it here hoping the history buffs can help me instead of the stack exchange movies beta thanks

10055 was this speech was delivered by macaulay in british parliament got many articles saying that this speech was not delivered by macaulay is it true what are the facts behind this speech have traveled across the length and breadth of india and have not seen one person who is beggar who is thief such wealth have seen in this country such high moral values people of such calibre that do not think we would ever conquer this country unless we break the very backbone of this nation which is her spiritual and cultural heritage and therefore propose that we replace her old and ancient education system her culture for if the indians think that all that is foreign and english is good and greater than their own they will lose their self esteem their native self culture and they will become what we want them truly dominated nation and got the quote from here and also reference here update it is concluded that the above speech mentioned in first in question was not delivered by macaulay reasons supporting this conclusion are quite convincing by teds answer and also the ngrams by felix also point to the same as got another controversial version of the speech from the links mentioned by thought of doing ngram searches on this version too the other version of the speech from the links is accept catholic beyond the across and across of india and accept not apparent one getting who is beggar who is thief such abundance accept apparent in this country such top moral values humans of such caliber that do not anticipate we would anytime beat this country unless we breach the actual courage of this nation which is her airy and cultural heritage and therefore adduce that we alter her old and age old apprenticeship system her culture for if the indians anticipate that all that is adopted and english is acceptable and greater than their own they will lose their self esteem their built in self culture and they will become what we ambition them absolutely bedeviled nation the results are interesting anyway those 1830s and 1840s are really confusing and now wonder about the source of this one

10087 anyone can answer this question but am particularly interested in hearing from people with knowledge of northern virginia geography for the union much of the focus of the civil war was attacking and capturing the confederate capital of richmond virginia early in the war the norths general mcclellan waged the brilliantly conceived but poorly executed peninsula campaign from the coast using seapower but he was the exception after this campaign and the battle of antietam mcclellans successors preferred to swing west through fredericksburg burnside chancellorsville hooker and the wilderness grant this was true even though the terrain favored the confederates who won all three above mentioned battles what made this route through the same general area so attractive to different union generals
10206 when reading literature about the babylonian the destruction of jerusalem always wonder which year it took place some books says ce and some says ce is this because one dont know or is there some other reason if one dont know what are the arguments for one or the other of these dates also know the jehovahs witnesses say it was in and if someone has anything to say about the facts that contradict this year would love to hear it
10210 the ming dynasty had reportedly one of the largest navies in the world during the 15th and 16th centuries which is when the new world was being discovered by europeans they also had made contact with european traders during this time and had surely heard about the americas that were being visited by the spanish english french etc why did they never send any fleets across the pacific and try to claim piece of the new landmass that was being explored during this time

10310 constantinople was the focal point for the fourth crusade the christians lost and constantinople went to the ottoman empire then the european christians became stronger and went about colonizing the rest of the world in the meantime the ottoman empire grew weaker yet despite the europeans territorial ambitions as colonists why didnt they try taking back constantinople the ottomans have weakened so it shouldnt be too difficult constantinople is present day istanbul
10316 if the american civil war was about liberating the slaves then it might make sense to expect the war to have been fought between slaves and their masters in theory the slaves should be the ones fighting for their own freedom however both sides of the warring parties were primarily non slaves why couldnt slaves do more for themselves and why did the non slaves fight so hard for the slaves freedom
10319 hundreds of years ago china was more advanced than europe and even the ottomans why didnt china become colonial master ming dynasty zheng he went on huge shipping expeditions and could have done what the europeans did to the new world most puzzlingly instead of robbing gold from the weaker countries like what the spaniards did to the aztecs zheng he did the opposite by presenting gifts of gold to the countries his ships dropped by today the new world has become extension of old europe china is still china did the chinese make wrong calculation with their extreme generosity or were they really such magnanimous people
10330 the average horse eats pounds per day according to this pet website considering the fact that the horses may have to eat even more because of the hard traveling they had to endure its likely that food costs must have been incredible genghis khans army traveled an average of miles km day during the china campaigns with some claiming they traveled miles per day when charging towards target in addition each horseman kept horses in tow what really mystifies me is that he managed to conquer the khwarazmian empire with to mounted archers even though it was situated in eastern iran dry and arid desert
10331 shields were considered useful in europe until the development of full plate armor despite the fact that they never had anything comparable to plate armor shield use was apparently abandoned by the edo period the freestanding tate was used to protect archers but aside from this shields dont seem to be used at all some argue that shield use was obsolete by the edo period because they were clumsy and because japan lacked hellenistic influences while im not sure agree with that am unable to evaluate that assertion
10409 christianity started off as cult religion before becoming major religion today the major event that put christianity on the road to world domination was the conversion of emperor constantine into christianity what strategic value did christianity hold for constantine that made him convert to christianity this question assumes that constantine was calculating politician who converted to christianity for personal advantage and not out of pure holiness of course no one will ever know what went through his mind at that point in time
10411 at one point in history the roman catholic church was the largest land owner in europe given the power of compounding the length of time for the compounding to take effect plus the huge principal size to start with the catholic church should easily be the worlds richest organization today however it is not what happened to the accumulated wealth of the catholic church
10420 under the treaty of versailles germany was forced to make heavy war reparations to the victors of world war what puzzles me was that the reparations were denominated in marks german currency at that time this gave germany the option to default via inflation it was exactly what happened given that war victors have always been able to dictate the terms why did the victors not denominate the reparations in solid gold which is unprintable given that the world was still on the gold standard at that time it seemed gold would look like more logical currency
10447 the most popular religious and non historical reason why jesus was crucified is to atone for humanitys sin if search in google most sites would show this theory what is the secular historical reason for christ to be put to trial several parties said that jesus was crucified because of series of different reasons such as people actually wanted him to be king by screaming hosanna to him that would change political structures at that time and hence motivate status quo to kill him he claimed to be god so the religious leaders wanted to kill him for blasphemy but pilate who saw this as mere religious difference do not find anything worthy of capital punishments and hence wanted to set jesus free the religious leaders were jealous of his influence he punched and kicked things around in the temple would that be plausible or maybe there are other reasons
10458 at the civil war battle of brandy station the attacking union cavalry general alfred pleasanton brought along some infantry to even the odds because his cavalry was outnumbered to by that of confederate commander stuart during the battle both sides were forced to dismount with one quarter of the cavalrymen holding the horses of three others so the infantry was actually worth cavalry when this happened the confederates won tactical victory but the union troops gained valuable fighting experience brandy station showed what infantry could do against cavalry in an era of repeating weapons such as colt revolvers and breech loading rifles but did it make sense for qualitatively and quantitatively inferior cavalry force to reinforce itself in this way using infantry to increase your numbers in attacking enemy cavalry before the introduction of fireams that is to say in the ancient period or middle ages when your infantry was likely to be inferior to your cavalry in fighting enemy cavalry im not talking about situations in say the years war at crecy or poitiers when english infantry and cavalry fought on the defensive while archers did the damage better example would be at alesia should vercingetorix have sent infantry along with his cavalry to try to disrupt the roman circumvallation process which was fended off by caesars german cavalry some other potential applications are there times when attacking cavalry can use infantry to defend key points such as passes can infantry be used profitably to flush out enemy cavalry from defensive ground such as trees and bushes and into the open field can infantry be used as rear guard against enemy cavalry while your cavalry regroups for counterattack or were the disadvantages of infantry against cavalry before the days of firearms so great as to preclude such uses
10475 at the start of the 19th century asian countries had militaries less effective than western nations in the us navy forced japan to enter into trade with the united states the japanese realized they were too weak to defend themselves then and had to agree to the terms thereafter the japanese started to modernize themselves and became major asian power in the 20th century china had its own humiliating experience that should have jolted it into similar action like japan it was the first opium war with the british it occurred even earlier in and was far more unjust and humiliating china suffered another major humiliation at the hands of the western powers during the boxer rebellion unfortunately china did not modernize and remained weak throughout most of the 20th century why was 19th century japan able to modernize and not china
10478 what can be said about historical perspective of this document seemingly composed in german
10492 the turks were technologically more advanced than the europeans during the middle ages one major reason behind the europeans backwardness was that their freedom of thought was stifled by dogmatic christianity the christian leaders had strong political power and it was dangerous to disobey them the ottoman empire also had their politics mixed with religion but to different degree why did religion mixed with politics hold back progress of europeans but not the turks one underlying assumption behind this question is that religion mixed with politics tends to be bad for progress medieval christian europe was good example
10572 internet resources on the mongol empire usually dwell on the mongol conquests of huge mass of territory unfortunately seldom are the reasons behind the conquests explained one gets the impression that the mongols were conquering for the sake of conquering to satisfy their ego of becoming the biggest land conquerors in world history on the guiness book of records however this is seldom so because of the huge costs of war given the relatively small population of the mongols less than 3m today even mongolia itself should be enough surely after conquering significant parts of china it should be more than enough why did the mongols still want to move on to conquer the other parts of asia russia europe what purpose do these territories serve them even if they manage to conquer successfully it is doubtful if the mongol population was large enough to spread throughout the conquered territories to rule and preserve their power on long term basis what reasons drove the mongols to want to conquer such huge land territory
10610 instead of splitting his invasion force into three groups it appears it would have been more sensible to focus on taking over the caucasus region first at the time baku caucasus oil metropolis accounted for of all soviet production considering that the soviets most likely would have suffered serious shortages without baku oil it appears it would have been sensible to capture the caucasus and then wait for chronic oil shortages to affect the soviets before advancing furthermore diversification of sources of oil appears important considering that hitler was very concerned about the possibility of the soviets devastating his rumanian oil fields which contributed of germanys oil in understand that many argue that hitlers hubris was factor but are there any other reasons
10632 on one hand the bulgarians signed on with nazi germany when the latter was looking for balkan allies against russia so did hungary and romania hungary had been part of the austro hungarian empire during world war and also had an alliance with italy against yugoslavia romania had been pro allied during world war but sided with germany for roughly the same reasons as finland the soviet union had annexed parts of romania bessarabia and northern bukovina in bulgaria had aided the central powers against the serbs during world war and did somewhat the same for the axis against yugoslavia in when that country originally an axis signatory backed out but unlike the other two balkan states bulgaria did not willingly send troops to russia to assist germany also bulgarians resisted nazi efforts to round up the countrys jews unlike the others finally the bulgarians were south slavs whom hitler at least disliked in this regard they might have been considered similar to the treacherous yugoslavs or were they seen as turkic people that some scholars consider them to be turkey had also been german ally in world war did the nazis have similar views of the bulgarians as the other non slavic axis signatories after or were they considered necessary evil to be dealt with after the war more harshly than the others
10633 communist economic systems self implode today it has been recognized that communism is bad for economic progress there is no dispute that communism makes countries poor based on what has happened in recent history however what is puzzling was that despite this the soviet union enjoyed fast economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s why was this so
10688 it occurred to me that germany was extremely productive in at least physics in the first thirty years of the twentieth century and especially in the period between the end of the first world war and the start of nazi germany when hitler came to power are there any reasons to point at for this productiveness one might expect that country is far less productive in the sciences when it has just lost war
10699 the modern translation by bing is swedish ski jump or swedish hill depending on whether or not insert space but this seems very unlikely in that time period the structure is clearly man made and about the size of small football stadium but seems to be much simpler in structure the object can be found or km north east of landshut and km south east of ergolding on this map and appears like this at scale
10739 in the middle ages lithuania ruled over not only the modern lithuania but also modern belarus and large parts of the modern western ukraine the inhabitants of these ukrainian territories seemed to accept lithuanian rule for over two centuries without problems but in the 17th century poland lithuanias partner in the polish lithuanian commonwealth started taking over ukrainian affairs this led to the revolt of the cossacks and other ukrainians such as bogdan kmelnytsky mid century my understanding is that that poles were far less benevolent to the ukrainians than the lithuanians the questions are in what ways and why that is why did polish nobles stir the pot when lithuanian rulers had pacified the region for over two centuries for instance the kmelnytsky article refers to vilius lithuanina panagyric praising him
10749 the royal library of alexandria is estimated to have had over half million documents and house about scholars according to this article this would suggest fairly decentralized archiving system perhaps with every section having its own system of record keeping according to the relevant wikipedia entry the library also engaged in textual criticism which implies further detailed record keeping apart from that couldnt find any other insights into how the collection was organized what do we know about the indexing system used by the library to clarify the title refers to the organization of the manuscripts not the structural organization of the library itself
10760 frederick the great king of prussia made name for himself and prussia in the seven years war winning key battles against the french and austrians at long odds he won the battle of rossbach against the french outnumbered almost to other prussian generals beat the french at lesser odds at krefeld and minden frederick beat the austrians at his signature battle at leuthen outnumbered more than two to one one might attribute this to the incompetence of the austrian commander prince charles of lorraine maria theresas brother in law but frederick also defeated the austrians at liegnitz and torgau at lesser odds later in the war the one enemy frederick had no success against was russia the battle of zorndorf aptly named angry village in german where both sides took around casualties was basically drawn battle and at best pyrrhic victory for frederick at the battle of kunersdorf where two thirds of the opposing force was russian the remainder austrian and the numerical odds nearly even frederick suffered major defeat trying to turn likely minor victory into major one and so far as know neither frederick nor any of his subordinates won any victory to speak of against the russians only through the death of tsarina elizabeth was the russian threat mitigated why might that have been were the russian soldiers better than the french and austrians were the russian commanders better or did the russians fight in style that frederick didnt understand
10849 considering the city state of athens and its interesting idea of direct democracy am comparing and contrasting the political activity of ancient athenians and modern americans americans in particular are some of the least politically active people in the world reading about athens have always wondered how the athenians made it work so my question is back in the city state of athens why were the citizens so politically active was it just because citizenship had to be earned instead of just being given was it because athenian citizenship was hard to get and not available to everyone slaves women etc it just seems to be that civic duty back then required so much more time and attention and somehow people did it today even the simplest things like voting once year or being on jury once year is such great burden and people try to get out of it as much as possible what was so different back then thank you
10852 know jewish culture tend to like number what about other cultures do we have days in week from bible why do we derive days week from jews why not from more prominent culture like roman greek etc
10866 in earlier wars against the british and germans the seven years war of french armies did not particularly distinguish themselves even with numerical advantage yet during the french revolution and the napoleonic era french armies were generally victorious even against professional prussian austrian and russian armies when the french had no numerical advantage this was true even though french armies consisted of mixture of enthusiastic but non professional troops that seemed to have no fear bolstered by the presence of veterans this was mix similar to the last victorious days of the american revolution what led to french advantages did the ideology of the revolution lead to morale boosts that gave amateur french volunteers an advantage over professional but conscripted enemies did the revolution create survival of the fittest ethos that led to the rise of the best generals such napoleon did the french benefit from home field advantage in the early days
10868 the thirteen colonies and indian subcontinent were two of the most significant colonies of the british empire yet the former was able to gain independence via rebellion relatively early on whilst the latters attempts failed and only gained independence after wwii time when war weary home front was reluctant to hold on to far off imperial holdings the two cases share few similarities but many more dissimilarities focusing on their differences what were the key ones that lead to the united states successful rebellion and indias failures was the uss successful rebellion fluke or were there factors in favor of the us but not for india

10929 friend of friend has just written that washington lafayette and jefferson all rode side saddle to ease the pain of their war injuries before proceed to dismantle this person with extreme prejudice wanted to double check cant find any record that washington was wounded during the revolutionary war and im very skeptical that jefferson who never fought was wounded perhaps he fell during his flight from williamsburg is anyone aware of any record of any of the founding fathers riding sidesaddle for any reason update with couple of notes the foaf didnt specify time period from the context of the comments it sounded like she was referring to the post revolutionary period id be happy with evidence showing washington or the others in side saddle at any point in their lives but id be happiest with the revolutionary war period im aware that have asked se to prove negative and that should eat some crow because ive criticized others for this in the past is there any evidence that washington was either wounded or suffered from some other ailment arthritis back hip problems that might have required him to ride sidesaddle im aware that washington was renown as rider during the revolutionary war are there contemporary accounts of his riding towards the end of his life should eat more crow because havent documented my preliminary research some of it is in personal interviews with the historian of the international side saddle organization ive also searched for any evidence that washington was wounded during the revolutionary war found no indication of any serious wounds during his career see that lafayette fought with leg wound during the battle of brandywine but havent found any evidence that he rode sidesaddle jefferson has no military career other than cowardly flight so im going to exclude the possibility of war injuries for jefferson riding sidesaddle doesnt necessarily imply an injury to the bum sidesaddle can be more comfortable seat as result of back injuries im not an authority on the subject but understand it can also be more comfortable for people who suffer from scoliosis and for certain leg injuries
10932 how much is known of the carthaginian language which as understand it is called punic and descended from phoenician google searches show some sketches of alphabet characters and such but do we know enough to be able to learn it as viable language today the way we can with latin are there many samples and fragments available for study if not is there specific reason why the language of such powerful empire has been lost did the romans try to purge it or something or was it just the ravages of time
10933 was playing starcraft the other night and it occurred to me that game series portrays effectively way war where all three factions are fighting the other two with equal ferocity obviously in real life various factions tend to make alliances in order to fight shared enemies even if they arent natural allies on their own like the soviets and the western allies in wwii allying to fight the axis so was wondering whats the biggest longest conflict in real history that truly had more than sides im sure there have been skirmishes between city states or factions within civil war where whole bunch of groups were all fighting amongst themselves but has there ever been large scale protracted conflict that remained equally fierce amongst multiple powers alliances all fighting each other

10984 germany lost in world war ii being the loser its economy started at disadvantage compared to her world war ii victors in the aftermath of ww2 however germany managed to recover more successfully than her world war ii victors to become the dominant european economic power by the late 20th century what did germany do to become more prosperous than its victors after world war ii can the troubled european nations of today draw lessons from germanys history of rebuilding so successfully despite being loser in both world wars

11000 was watching documentary about the ulfberht swords from scandinavia and one thing caught my attention it mentioned that these swords were made over range of time and location that was broad enough that they couldnt have been made by the same craftsman that ulfberht name even if it started as craftsmans mark became simply name for sword of that particular style design and quality effectively it became brand that made me wonder when was the first appearance of brand names for products for the purposes of this discussion we can define brand name as an abstract label associated with particular product and or production facility but not with any particular person or simple descriptor so not da vinci painting or italian marble but something equivalent to nike shoe where designers can come and go but the name retains its continuity were there product lines like swords or dresses or furniture in ancient rome that were known by name independent of their maker in china or medieval europe when did product first become detached from its maker in the minds of the consumers

11017 some says china invented the printing press however another says that gutenberg invented the printing press nevertheless western printing press is superior for reasons we know gutenberg name this is civilization that remember their inventor the name of some chinese that invent printing press is much less known gutenberg printing press is faster so how much faster is this mainly due to alphabeths or different techniques by how much both printing press improve economy
11033 you hear all the time in ancient history about cities or fortresses being besieged for year or two years or even many years such as the sieges of tripoli or carthage or drepana im wondering what would the attacking armies do that whole time did they just set up shop built little town and wait the defenders out or were there usually active efforts to break in going throughout that whole time know its tough challenge to break through fortified city and theres always the option of just starving them out but it seems strange to have an army at your disposal and not be actively using it to try to win whether through attacking head on or infiltrating or tunneling or bribing or even just throwing flaming arrows and stones over the wall to make life hell for the citizens all day every day but on the other hand its also hard to imagine that active daily efforts like that could be resisted for years at time even an army without major siege equipment could set fire to the city with arrows or flaming debris shot over the wall or even build ramp up to the wall itself like at masada or tyre hell it seems like just lobbing big rock once or twice every couple of hours would knock down gate or wall in less than year obviously that kind of thing would be difficult and expensive but surely it wouldnt compare to the expense of keeping an army in the field indefinitely so were multi year sieges characterized by long periods of inactivity where the attacking army basically just loitered outside the city or were most sieges characterized by consistent activity throughout and the length merely speaks to just how tough it is to break through city walls
11044 frequently come across these three terms but havent been able to find source that explains the difference between all three of them precisely heres what think know now the early modern period is roughly around the 1500s 1800s it begins with european exploration and ends around the period of the french revolution the late modern period follows the early modern period and ends around world war now heres where im lost is the modern period defined by both the early modern period and late modern period how does post modern period fit into to the picture it should logically follow the late modern period but some sources refer to this period as the modern era as well which doesnt make sense to me because its not the modern era its post modern
11053 in september britain traded number of its new world naval base sites for overaged old destroyers in the so called destroyer deal that doesnt seem like large number of destroyers except that it was large relative to the existing british destroyer fleet why did britain have so few destroyers even after its world war experience with submarine warfare that they needed to trade for old ones
11062 in his state of the union address president franklin delano roosevelt commented in africa we are shooting down two enemy planes to every one we lose and in the pacific and the southwest pacific we are shooting them down four to one studies by depuy and others have shown that on the ground one american british or soviet soldier was not the equal of one german soldier and even with large superiority in numbers and firepower allied forces had difficulty inflicting human casualties on the germans at rate much above one to one the disparity in tank effectiveness was even more skewed in favor of the germans as they inflicted tank casualties on the allies at multiple of their own what accounts for the relative superiority in the air and is it fair to say that without air superiority the and allies would have had great difficulty beating the germans or are there credible sources or studies that show that the allies could have won only using overwhelming numbers and firepower on the ground without superior airpower
11143 do we have any records about what nazi germany planned to do if the soviet union had surrendered cant imagine they wanted to swallow that entire country whole all the way to the pacific theyd have no troops left for fighting the war in the west and south therefore assume they would have followed the pattern they set in france taking some territory themselves and setting up vichy equivalent for the rest is that assumption supported by german documents available at the time if so do we have any idea what the bounds specifics of the puppet state would have been and if not are there any indications of what hitlers plan was for russia after she surrendered

11214 ive been trying to understand this for some time now it seems to me that propaganda should only work if the audience doesnt know that its propaganda so if the nazis goal was to control its population and deceive them via goebbels ministry which controlled the media and produced popular films and so on wouldnt they be undermining themselves by calling this ministry the ministry of propaganda to me its lot like giving someone placebo and then telling them that its placebo it no longer works in that case because its efficacy depends on the subject genuinely believing in its authenticity people have suggested to me that perhaps historians have retroactively given goebbels and his ministry these titles but the impression get from all the literature and documentaries is that at the time then and there in nazi germany his title really was minister of propaganda
11286 background in september the allied forces invaded southern italy in combined airborne amphibious operations in reggio di calabria operation baytown salerno operation avalanche and taranto operation slapstick at first these operations were relatively successful despite quite fierce resistance from the german tenth army the allied progressed quickly northwards on two fronts however they were stopped at the so called winter line where the germans exploited very successfully the natural geographical defenses provided by the appennine mountains in january started the battles of montecassino which ended only five months later after inflicting casualties on the allies more than double the german ones even so it would take one more month to take rome after that the allies moved quickly north to the so called gothic line where they were once again halted in autumn for several months and in fact the surrender of german forces in northern italy only happened in april historiographic significance in french common historiography as presented for instance in history textbooks the italian campaign is treated with great importance would conjecture that this is due to the heavy involvement of french free forces mostly from northern africa and to the fact that this was the first time in wwii where french forces inflicted significant defeats on german forces thereby avenging the humiliating defeat of would venture that this campaign may perhaps have the same significance in poland for the same reasons the american british and canadian point of view seems much more ambiguous possibly due to the heavy casualties suffered during the italian campaign and the lack of symbolic military victories to remember strategic significance whatever its place in current historiography purely from strategic point of view the italian campaign seems at first sight to be rather german success of course the allied eventually came to prevail but at an extremely high cost beside had the war gone on after april it is unclear to me where the forces in italy would have gone and what their strategic use would have been on the other hand the opening of second ground front in western europe was vitally important to relieve the eastern front and was actively campaigned for by stalin with the benefits of historical hindsight is the italian campaign now considered strategic mistake or at least sub optimal strategy by military historians for instance is it now believed again with hindsight that canceling the italian campaign in favor of advancing the combination of operation overlord and operation dragoon whose progresses were much more spectacular at least in part it seems because of the lack of natural defenses would have been better strategy or is it thought that these two operations had to take place in summer in which case summer seems obviously too early and thus the italian campaign was better than nothing let me make it clear that do not wish to speculate about alternative history and that believe have reasonable understanding of why the italian campaign was chosen against the alternatives at the time my question is solely about the current strategic evaluation of this choice now that we know how events unfolded update have learnt lot from the two answers and have up voted them accordingly but still wonder if ri swamp yankee and tom au or anyone else obviously would care to expand their answers in the relative direction for instance tom au cites the psychological effect of knocking one of the axis down sure but wouldnt the liberation of france be an even greater psychological victory likewise for the economic impact surely the bulk of industrial production was located in northern italy which remained under german control almost to the end and surely again the liberation of france would have deprived germany of an even larger industrial base and similarly again or so it seems to me with the number of german soldiers tied down considering the excruciatingly slow and murderous progress the allies made in italy after the initial landing perhaps the soldiers and planes engaged in monte cassino would have been better employed in normandy or in provence mean the statistics are rather damning in just about month the soldiers of operation dragoon inflicted casualties on the german forces provoked the withdrawal of the german army to the vosges and suffered casualties in the process to be compared with what soldiers accomplished in montecassino in months at the price of casualties now again think understand why the strategic decision to invade italy was taken at the time what really want to know about more is whether the combined invasions of france or any massive operation on the western front was deemed possible in early or if it was deemed necessary to wait until the summer for instance to ensure favorable climate references most of the facts discussed above are well resourced starting with wikipedias page italian campaign and references therein the assertion about the role of the italian campaign in popular french historiography comes from my own recollection of my education note also the tremendous box office success of the movie indig nes
11307 in the medieval ages peasants used to drink beer instead of water because the plain water wasnt safe to drink why do people in countries where the water sources are polluted not do this today why did this practice emerge in some countries but not others
11327 in fantasy literature there are plenty of examples of cultures such as the dwarves of lord of the rings who favor axes or hammers above swords in combat did any historical army follow that pattern obviously some people in any battle will have unusual weapons and an angry mob will grab anything thats convenient some armies like the greek phalanx also used pikes or other length based weapons that reduced the need for hand to hand weapons entirely but were there ever any armies where they fought up close and face to face but where the standard melee weapon was an axe hammer or something other than straight blade like sword or knife have distant memory that bronze age cultures in the middle east used some kind of sickle shaped weapon but cant think of any after that
11343 there is currently big polemic in french news media about antisemitism french comedian is accused to propagate antisemitic ideas in france have no intention to propagate this polemic on this forum but one of his claims is that triangular trade and black people slavery was organized at least in france by jewish ship owners he repeated this claim several times in the media so was curious to do some fact checking as know almost nothing about that difficult event in french history found nothing real to support those claims as was expecting but im not sure where to search real information about that specific fact so im asking this question to know more about who were the traders who organized the triangular slave trade and what can say to people who support such claims

11428 there were some claims for example in the 1st chapters of moses and monotheism by freud that early judaism was basically spin off of akhenatens religion there are indeed some remarkable similarities akhenaten an egyptian is perhaps the 1st monotheist in history judaism is the 1st organized monotheistic religion and its becoming one is associated with the exodus from egypt akhenaten calls his god aton one of the names used in judaism is adon or adonai the word moses means son in egyptian as in ra mses or tut mos biblical moses was raised as the son of an egyptian princess perhaps because he was one moses was fluent in egyptian but tongue tied in hebrew even after considerable time as the leader of jews there are also remarkable dis similarities between early judaism and the traditional egyptian worship that denied the religion of akhenaten the animals that were traditionally worshipped in egypt not by akhenaten are deemed dirty in judaism jews are forbidden to shave their heads which was common practice in egypt etc etc etc the speculation by freud goes something like this the followers of akhenatens religion are persecuted after akhenatens death the son of akhenatens daughter known further as the son or moses decided to flee egypt natural leader he decides not to flee alone but to create new nation become it leader and install the religion of aton with it jews enslaved in the delta seemed good pick he convinces aaron the son of his wet nurse to disseminate the story that moses was actually jew and to act as mosess mouthpiece and perhaps hebrew egyptian interpreter thus the question is there any historical evidence to either support or deny such claim are there any contradictions between the described above speculated line of events and some reasonably known facts about ancient egypt history
11429 according to the answer of this question columbus was pretty much unique in his belief that the world was small enough and asia was big enough to make sailing west to asia possible everyone else expected correctly that it was way too far away to be practical option of course it ended up being moot because there was completely new landmass in between europe and asia the americas columbus landed there instead and the rest was history but if the europeans had anything even approaching an accurate idea of how far away asia was to the west they must have realized that that would be colossal ocean about miles we can now estimate did anyone propose the idea that there was more than water out there that an ocean that big might hold whole new continent or even more than one before you got back around to india especially given the viking discoveries of america and of iceland and greenland were there rumors or discussions of other lands to the west or did the european powers just assume it was empty ocean all the way to asia right up until they discovered an enormous landmass blocking their way
11437 true or false this is claimed by andrew roberts in the storm of war quote as more frenchmen bore arms for the axis than for the allies during the second world war it is unsurprising that there is still no official french history of the period who in turn cites max hastings sunday telegraph available here quote after reading this narrative and recalling the brutal statistic that more frenchmen bore arms for the axis than for the allies during the second world war it seems unsurprising that france still has no plans for an official history of hastings however gives no reference for this claim

11700 it is sometimes hard for layman to separate well researched history from the writings of kooks or what mark twain called inspired idiots for example my local library carries secret history of the english language this book attempts to make reasoned claims that english is not descended from anglo saxon and that french descends from english rather than from latin one could begin to be suspicious of its revisionism based on the sensational title but then prominently displayed on the cover is quote from norman cantor who have read and do respect as serious historian the quote reads fascinating and deeply learned read it twice norman cantor professor emeritus medieval studies columbia university what did he read it second time to locate all the factual errors and bad assumptions does he actually believe this unusual take on linguistics did he have fun comparing the authors hysteria with his own measured tone more to my general question how can one differentiate legitimate overturning of outdated assumptions necessary part of any scientific endeavor from kooks who want to kick over the anthill because its fun

11755 apparently the ukraine is actually split east and west many people in the eastern part would prefer for their country to be part of russia while protesters in the western ukraine wants something different perhaps full independence unless they want to align with some country in europe or europe generally both parts of ukraine were originally part of kievan rus early in the past millenium but they seemed to diverge around mid millenium when the eastern part became part of russia while the western part became part of the polish lithuanian commonwealth yet under bogdan khiemelnytsky many in the western ukraine didnt want to be part of the commonwealth either where do the stated wishes of western and eastern ukrainians differ today and how do those statements align with those of the past or put another way what historical differences between western and eastern ukrainians would cause them to differ today or is the distinction between west and east ukraine although grounded in history now an artificial one today

11805 when germany signed the armistice in the first world war they were still technically in decent bargaining position germany still had troops in france and belgium there were no enemy forces in german territory germany had already won the war on the eastern front german forces were still in relatively good condition great britain and france were not motivated for an invasion of germany due to pure exhaustion although the influx of fresh american resources and manpower may have made it technically possible now im not here to argue that germany could have emerged victorious they had lost allies they were starting losing ground and they were no longer able to reinforce adequately had the war been allowed to go on they would most likely have faced total defeat sooner than the allied powers perhaps expected however considering the points made above wonder why the allied powers demanded such harsh peace terms germany was not allowed place at the bargaining table and aside from huge war reparations territorial losses demilitarisation and other terms they were even forced to cede the territories they had already gained in the peace treaty on the eastern front many of you will probably note that this led to the conspiracy theory dolchsto legende which concludes that germany did not lose military but rather to traitorous elements at home some also argue that the treaty was meant to permanently render germany useless as military might but that it ultimately had the opposite effect justification to take back what was theirs

12035 the issue of israeli settlements in the west bank and other territories is quite controversial including its legality and its impact on the peace process im wondering if there was any similar occurrence in recent history has an occupying power built settlements and transfer its own population to the occupied territories if there are such cases how did it happen how was the international reaction and how was the issue resolved if it was if need to specify my definition lets say recent means anything since the 20th century the territories were occupied as result of war or some other coercive means the territories were big significant enough not just city or microstate as comparison the west bank population is million lets use this as minimum the occupying power transfered its civilians to the occupied territories to live and the settler population should be significant say more than of the native population as comparison according to wikipedia there is about israeli settler per west bank palestinians
12039 in researching this question on medieval light cavalry came across this reference to currours in wikipedia with no link many countries developed their own styles of light cavalry such as hungarian mounted archers spanish jinetes italian and german mounted crossbowmen and english currours emphasis mine the only other decent references could dig up were some uncited opinions on this miniatures message board that they were used on the scottish border and some speculation based on the etymology of the name theres also this dictionary entry which implies the word may also have been used for forrest rangers so what exactly were the english light cavalry currours and how were they employed

12102 was reading few articles about population growth and famines and thereby discovered that some of the recent famines where caused by government policies among which read at least twice ussr and china that collectivisation played major role in decreasing farming labour efficiency or at least crop distribution efficiency so here comes my question are there instances where collective farming has actually brought benefit to the population of an area not necessarily in terms of crops throughput but more in terms of wellbeing also have there been instances where communal dining has brought increased efficiency of food usage as opposed to the over consumption induced by this policy in the mid 20th century china thought maybe rural societies or at least more decentralised maybe more primitive communities might have had better chance to benefit from such measures but have found little information in regard to farming and cooking policies of lets say the amish people for example

12127 are there any ancient texts that show or imply that their authors knew that certain diseases were spread through sexual activity it seems like sexual contagion was recognized in the 16th century during the height of the syphilis epidemic have even read that it contributed to closing of some brothels and the rise of puritanism am more interested if anyone in rome greece or the middle east realized connection between sex and disease during the bronze age or the classical period there were plenty of commercial brothels in the roman empire and plenty of temple prostitutes in the ancient middle east is there any evidence of std epidemics from then realize that germ theory would not be around until the nineteenth century but ancient historian or philosopher still could have noticed correlation
12159 the industrial revolution started in great britain in the 18th century the precursor to the industrial revolution was the enlightenment this occurred when european scholars rediscovered greek and roman ideas one outcome was the discovery of the scientific method as well as an overall rational viewpoint towards scholarship and europeans applied it in their home countries with great results great britain seems to share many qualities with the classical ancient societies of greece and rome so wanted to know what was specifically different about great britain that allowed it to develop the industrial revolution the following are few things that were the same empires with wide trading networks rational science technology and philosophy rome had strong legal system the british legal system was based on the roman one and is an explanation for its protections of property rights democratic societies even if not everyone could actually vote urbanization rome understood the concepts of an assembly line and specialization which great britain rediscovered through adam smith the following are things believe might be dissimilar the invention of the internal combustion engine mechanization through steam power feel am either overgeneralizing or have left things off the second list
12173 ive been watching the show vikings on the history channel and on the latest episode christians capture an alleged apostate as punishment they decide to crucify him of course this is just show but it got me wondering did any christians anywhere at any time ever use crucifixion as means of punishment
12221 in north america the native corn maize was the dominant grain and flour and an important mainstay in the diet at first it was obviously the only available grain crop with old world cereals such as wheat not being introduced but for what seems an oddly long time right up to the turn of the 20th century it remained the favored crop and daily food in many forms bread whiskey etc was the soil particularly favourable towards maize and were they simply most experienced and accustomed to maize farming before old cereals were introduced widely was it simply preference that finally phased out with the onset of globalization was there major export demand to meet though this doesnt explain the simple family farms out west is there any other reason it took so long for wheat to take over as the universal mainstay grain and when might this have been more specifically and little question on the side if they made their whiskey with corn did they also use it in beer commonly
12228 thought that how and why did the soviet union collapse is good question so would like to rephrase it bit but the question was too far gone to edit the soviet union collapsed in with many former ussr states breaking away to form their own countries one major short term reason for this is the collapse of the soviet client states in the warsaw pact in however what are some of the long term reasons argued by historians for the ussrs complete demise
12254 encountered problem to define something as history namely the determination of legal status of kosovo the action is so recent would say it more belongs to politics for my impression history is something which is no longer discussed by current politics history always get new scope and viewpoints but in sense of history not politics for example we can consider ww2 as historical event since it is ended and interpreted by various historians on the other hand kosovos status is still not clear even if most of the countries recognized it same with legal status of republic of china politics would discuss something what is not really closed and still have effect is there clear and professional definition on what is history and what is politics and maybe relevant extra question what makes political event become historical event
12256 it is said in debt the first years by david graeber chapter note that when the value of metal coins represented exactly their weight the result was deflation the author says that when lockes reforms were enacted the results were catastrophic how exactly did it pan out then it is said that when the coins are too much altered the result is inflation the author says that the political power maintained the value of its money by taxes how could it lose its value some say that the fall of the roman empire is related to its money being too much altered is it true
12273 am not history guy but from what have collected from movies tv shows and people see that old british society was male dominant and there were female rights issues too but also see some powerful queens in the history and the for queen and the country thing wheres the catch these two things dont look compatible
12297 was trying to look this up earlier and could not easily find reliable information on the internet mostly due to new popular claim that million people starved to death in the great depression otherwise for the most part what could find were claims that no one starved to death which are mostly predicated on the idea that all the deaths that seem like starvation are really severe malnutrition according to the un malnutrition is still the leading cause of death in the world today in the us tens of thousands were dying during the years of the depression from pellegra which was cured in through niacin supplementation this is known because there were pellegra hospitals and it was believed to be an infectious disease so there are good records new york which was of the us population was experiencing death by starvation and would keep track much better than most places such as appalachia or oklahoma where would think it would be much much worse before the new deal programs started there is evidence that many government agencies conducted studies on malnutrition levels but at the time they did not have an established definition or complete understanding of the symptoms of malnutrition would be or even what foods person must eat to not die source this and this so would be very interested to know how many people died of malnutrition or lack of calories if any estimate is possible since it is already demonstrable false to me it isnt necessary to disprove the claims in the pravda article
12305 today heard about seven deaths attributed to an explosion of bomb from world war seven dead as war bomb explodes in bangkok scrap yard hopefully the last death or deaths that can be reasonably regarded as caused by world war has already happened what was it and when did it happen
12370 while the spanish built huge colonial empire in the americas why didnt portugal colonize the south asian coast and only aimed at controlling trade why did these empires pursue such different strategies
12377 im not trying to start debate about if russias recent actions in the crimea are legal or whether the majority of the population agrees with what has happened however the action was successful partially because the russian troops did not use deadly force are there other examples of similar successes due not using deadly force please dont cite situations where in the end they ended in open warfare
12383 had one exam with the following question about the glorious revolution mark true or false in after the deposition of james ii the english parliament was divided in two groups tories and whigs whose political characteristics corresponded to the religious creed professed tories conservatives were catholics whigs liberals were anglicans the answer sheet marks the affirmation as correct but thought it was wrong on the basis that it was too easy an association between political party and religious faith edit the correct answer sheet now marks the affirmation as false which is fine to me
12448 understand that the usa funded the war effort against the axis although the allies in europe had to pay for this help in one way or another its fascinating to see how not that long ago roughly years events unfolded to leave us in the state the world is in now in life magazine editor henry luce predicted that the 20th century would be the american century at time when world war ii was in progress and america was profiting from the resulting trade and as we now know was about to join it was it world war ii or some other events that caused the rise of the usa to being superpower today
12460 whenever read about the collapse of the western half of the roman empire get feeling of total collapse as if no legions existed there anymore the collapse of the empire would also mean no payment for the legionaries am surprised read nothing about the legions existing at the time as if none existed or that they simply vanished without bribe or promise of further employment and what roman legionary would fight for barbarian king where were the legions in ad
12480 as far as im aware in australia currently only countries which are predominantly made up of people not of european descent such as china are seen as threat to australias manufacturing have majority european descent countries ever viewed other majority european descent countries as threat to their manufacturing im interested in both examples where the other country is seen as inferior whether racially religiously or culturally and where the other country is not seen as inferior
12509 in medieval in the broadest sense im not thinking of specific decade europe lands were split up amongst noblemen and these noblemen had hierarchy barons are lesser than earls which are lesser than dukes and so on see two ways of this happening and surely only one is correct method one the king gives for example of his land to his trusted earl and each to three barons method two the king gives of his land to his trusted earl and then cuts of that land to give it to baron thus the barons land is inside the earls and the baron has some kind of fealty to the earl in time of war the king would call on his earls who would in turn call on their barons which of these if either is more accurate realise medieval europe is an enormous scope so answers in general of examples from any time place in that rough area would be great
12516 from the late 1800s to the early 1900s in north america and australia how common were horses was it easy for every man or boy to own decent riding horse or were they relatively expensive and valuable based on availability and quality it seems the average cowboy owned very cheap low quality horse but how big was the market and availability for good horses such as were deliberately bred well and not just mustered up and broken how were horses sold

12564 the german enigma machines are the key for german victories during the early years of world war ii when the allies managed to capture few enigma machines and decode then the face of war began to change in favor of allies my question is is it possible to have multiple encryption decryption keys in same enigma machines so that it enables the users to send receive the 1st message using different encryption decryption key and the next message using different key
12605 the french flag the tricolour was installed as frances national flag shortly after the revolution in its colors are red and blue which are the colors of the flag of paris and white which was the colors of the bourbon rulers understand that blue and red were taken for the national flag since these colors being symbol of paris had been used by the citizens during the storm of the bastille however why was white added afterwards all three colors do not seem to have particularly revolutionary meaning and wasnt especially white symbol of the ancien gime the revolution seeked to abolish was there any discussion among the revolutionists concerning the flag at all were there any other proposals for the national colors why was the color combination as it is today chosen in the end
12606 what measures if any did law enforcement agents take against the rise of the ku klux klan in the south after the civil war from what have read there seems to have been lot of unrest in that period after the war and the klan took advantage of it by using intimidation and murder against the black population and republicans imagine there must have been laws passed against the kkk in the years after the civil war or that there were other groups or law enforcement agents who fought back against them
12607 heres something that puzzles me at the start of the third crusade richard sailed to the holy land around europe through the strait of gibraltar and across the mediterranean at the time the south of the iberian peninsula was under the control of the almohad caliphate im sure the 14km of strait was under heavy shipping traffic and think saladin was aware of what was coming so did the almohad empire not try to stop them or was the strait simply too big to control in that way could richards whole armada simply sail through unchallenged dont know what the relationship was between the almohad and the ayyubid dynasty but presumably theyd prefer other muslims to bunch of christians
12677 from british perspective in both ww1 and ww2 the usa have entered the war at later stage and supported the allies the decision for the us to enter the war has often been portrayed to be based on particular acts of aggression against them the sinking of the lusitania and the attack on pearl harbour was there ever any doubt which side the usa would join is there evidence to suggest that these triggers decide which side the usa would join as well as the level of their involvement
12680 when seeing some documentary about the history of medical science in the middle ages got the impression that many doctors were happy to merely study the works of galen rather than do their own research and that that was detrimental in the long run to medical science was this the case were there any other cases where books from classical times were detrimental to either the knowledge held in the middle ages or to the rate of acquiring new knowledge for the purposes of this question dont regard religious texts for example the bible as delaying scientific progress
12706 how were these organised into divisions grand divisions or battalions
12735 most countries land borders are somewhat rounded and its easy to guess why its eazy to defend rounded shape and its hard to defend bulges because it can be easily surrounded and occupied however jordans map has characteristic nearly rectangular bulge between syria and saudi arabia as can be seen on google maps here the lines are straight so you can understand that there were no valuable points to either of the sides also you cant see any town on goggle maps at this territory only desert so why this territory was allotted to jordan and not to say syria or saudi arabia
12768 according to this list how were nobles promoted for instance baron to viscount and duke to archduke if ranks are hereditary were there only specific number of each rank given out in each country is there record of this for instance does englands parliament have document outlining these numbers otherwise google is somewhat sparse and aristocracy seems like better tag than nobility
12800 presumably the arab goal in the arab israeli war was to defeat israel total victory would probably mean the total control of the whole mandatory palestine which at this point already contained significant jewish population and the abolition of the state of israel did the policymakers not the soldiers or the common population in the arab state have any plan or official policy about what they would do with the jewish population common rhetoric was to drive the jews into the sea was this an official policy know that several arab states were fighting the war and they probably had differing views it would be useful as well to compare the difference
12816 im researching armor from all time periods though most of my reference is from the medieval era and found theres little reference for how soldiers traveled with shields some shields have long strap in addition to the straps used to hold the shield in battle on their backside assume it was used to keep it on the wearers person but most of the shields ive looked at dont have this strap so how were shields worn on soldiers backs were soldiers able to sling shield off their back with ease like they do in the movies thank you for your time
12834 article from the nunatsiaq news claimed there was new evidence of european contact with the canadian arctic saying things like dating of some yarn and other artifacts presumed to be left by vikings on baffin island have produced an age that predates the vikings by several hundred years its been eight years since this article was published has the scholarly community gotten anywhere with this how likely is this pre viking contact looking note if your answer doesnt say anything about finds on or related to baffin island youre probably not answering the right question im not asking about polynesians in peru nor welsh in the midwest im asking about norse contact with baffin island around ad
12855 here in the uk we refer to the victorians or the era in which the victorians reigned recently read an article on the bbc about story set in the united states during the victorian era whilst this made sense from the perspective of the bbc being british company it did make me wonder if the era made any sense outside the borders of the uk do other countries even recognise it as an era are there equivalents when is it okay and not okay to refer to something in that era that is not contextually relevant have tagged as victorian
12872 guess most are familiar with the cartoonish bomb icon it is used to warn of metaphorical or literal explosive danger and shows deep black sphere with smaller cylinder attached that is where the burning fuse starts created by wikimedia commons user nevit dilmen license cc by sa wonder if historical background exists when where bombs like these used in warfare and what is the origin of this symbol

12963 since young am informed that taiwan is always part of china and should not seek independence and that the chinese communist party will not hesitate to use force to stop the taiwanese from seeking independence the newspapers read were mostly ccp party organ so you can imagine my skepticism my question is what is the historical basis for the claim that taiwan is always part of china because from what know national territory expands and shrinks all the time and is such claim valid in whatever sense and therefore the ccp can send tanks and airplanes into taiwan to prevent independence
12968 when im reading more about the late roman empire most of the time read that the roman emperors resided in ravenna instead of rome itself was there reason why the emperors of the late roman empire left rome or didnt reside there
12991 read about guinea itself how it was made but dont really understand why would anybody keep money worth more than an existing denomination like pound can accept the and concept even though it is not as comfortable as the decimal system but furthermore because of the gold content the value of the coin wasnt fixed in all time but in 1680s its worth moved away from pound and it was replaced by sovereign in the recoinage of dont really understand the reasons why the empire kept it for over century personally for me it looks messy without central concept how monetary system should be regulated within the empire maybe there are good reasons keeping it but dont see them update to make my point more clear see similar pattern in hungary when we introduced fine silver coin in after collapsion of socialism into circulation with huf face value shortly because of silver content it became more valuable so people just collected them and kept it as more inflation proof money it actually revoked itself from circulation and it was officially revoked by the government too this was clear failure of issue different based money and both people and government corrected the mistake naturally why didnt this happen in british empire for over years can say the value distortion was smaller between silver and gold price than silver and fiat money but this system in the british empire seems deliberately kept up for some reason
13028 know yuri gagarin was the first soviet and man in space who was the first russian not soviet in space
13039 many of us are familiar with the movements for free range or humane animal products have heard that in the antebellum us there were similar movements for humane slave products is this true while heard this specifically about the us would be interested in similar movements worldwide too edit with most ethical movements there are range of intensities with which people respond for example with environmentalism some people just advocate switching to cfls whereas others advocate not driving never eating meat etc this latter group is analogous to the abolitionists of slavery however im wondering what the former group is analogous to there mustve been people who said sure slavery is bad but its just too big of change for now lets focus on treating slaves better were there any such movements
13059 we have in the modern day no shortage of movies which feature characters from the medieval period of european history engaged in combat with swords cavalry and arrows do we have any historical documentation that describes the way that such character may have trained and fought with his weapons on an individual scale not concerned with large scale combat but more focused on training and single combat
13061 having read few discussions regarding the plantagenets and the ascending line of the monarchy since became curious about whether another group family had more legitimate claim to the throne asked and answered though not sufficiently in my opinion or if another family could become the monarch dont want to base question on an assumption but am curious all the same if by whatever manner the windsors could be replaced for lack of more appropriate term
13083 thinking about the anniversary of the normandy landings was struck that the terms day and hour were used to denote the start time of all allied military operations are there any specific reasons why the term has stuck to the particular operation of the normandy landings
13093 not sure how to word this remember back in high school learning about world war ii and distinctly remember that my teacher made mention that medics would often have to clear the battlefield and they would have like red cross symbol on them to identify them as such were these medics not considered targets by the enemy meaning did both sides consider these soldiers neutral also remember people saying that medics were also given access to no mans land and the enemy would not shoot them because they were getting bodies or something so they would have temporary ceasefire to allow both medics on both sides to gather the dead does this also apply to anyone else like did war photographers have special clothing insignia to signify they were neutral to the war or was it just shoot on sight policy sort of thing
14120 plato was the great philosopher and traveler in the story of philosophy william durant has written that he found his way to the banks of the ganges and learned the mystic meditations of the hindus but he also mentioned that historians had many debates on this personally think its very far distance from greece to india and it was very difficult to travel if we consider their timespan bc
14131 when was the concept of europe as singular political unit conceived when did people start to think of themselves as sharing similar european culture and calling themselves european for this answer dont mean the roman empire or christendom as these include many areas outside europe but specifically europe the eu would be good example but im hoping for something much earlier
14139 in england it was illegal to translate the bible from latin into english until the 14c when when john wycliffe campaigned to have this situation changed have often heard that the quran is untranslatable or rather great deal is lost when this is done has there ever been country or period when it was illegal to translate the quran from arabic
14145 when took latin classes remember studying texts about the virtus romana when you were man in rome it seems like you were expected to be the first in battle to be courageous and to have many manly qualities that you find in the modern stereotype of man although perfectly understand that fighting with your lover risking your life by your side is an incentive to fight more fiercefully it is kind of paradox for the 21st century man that homosexuality and virility were so linked at that time would really appreciate more insights on the matter and details about how homosexuality between men and soldiers was envisioned in ancient rome
14171 during the 16th century the portuguese captured melaka to dominate the lucrative spice trade other city states such as aceh banten brunei and pegu also sprung up by exporting and trading spices however dont quite understand why spice trading is such profitable venture as spices are quite expensive when they reach their terminal buyer there are sayings that compare spices to gold how did the high price of spices allow such high demand were the demands from the aristocrats capable of upholding and sustaining such high volumes of trade that enriched south asian city states assumptions was under the impression that the european population was predominantly serfs during and 16th century the abolition of serfdom wasnt until the 18th century for most european powers except england and france this is precisely why was confused as to how european buyers were capable of sustaining demand for something that wasnt necessity were the aristocrats of the european powers wealthy enough to buy spices at the price similar to that of gold and where did that wealth come from understand that high demand results in high prices but there must be some kind of wealth that is sustaining that demand or else the price will drop until the demand reaches the supply
14212 by definition anarchism advocates stateless society so guess cant be talking about an anarchist state or country so will just use state of anarchy with no negative connotation in any place that has been exposed and converted to an organised hierarchical society has there ever been successful return or conversion to anarchy by successful mean state of anarchy that persisted for at least few generations and where the inhabitants were able to live decently in relative security so this would exclude little social experiments that didnt last in the absence of one or more successful anarchies what are were the most promising ones edit as pointed out in the comments any answer to this question may be subjective and depend on the interpretation of stateless wont consider implicit agreements to be form of government like being nice to people hoping theyll be nice to you in return obeying special people like elders and religious figures would be considered form of government unless there is no punishment for going against their opinions and they are merely looked up to as being worthy of attention also would like to point out that am talking about conscious educated decision to move towards an anarchist society as such tribes who have arguably been in that state since the dawn of man or societies that have ended up in that state as result of war or other breakdown of their society do not count
14254 the united kingdom has nuclear weapons all the major political parties support this policy common justification heard is that they are deterrent against foreign aggression for example uk nuclear deterrence policy consists of main principles preventing attack the uk nuclear weapons are not designed for military use during conflict but instead to deter and prevent nuclear blackmail and acts of aggression against our vital interests that cannot be countered by other means yet in argentina without nuclear weapons invaded the falkland islands clearly they werent deterred why not
14303 in todays edition of le monde marek halter mentions something about jewish kings in carolingian france recognized by charlemagne probably using arthur zuckerman jewish kingdom in feudal france quick check on wikipedia says that this theory was rebutted by scholars including aryeh grabois in his paper le roi juif de narbonne annales du midi this publication is not available online the column of marek halter is in general publication and therefore has no bibliography wondered if anyone knew of reputable source available online to check disprove this statement am sorry if this is the professional history se ill remove my post if it is in maths where belong we have both layman maths and professional maths se but could did not see if there was such choice in history
14305 havent seen anything online even after googling wikipedia seems to only list the countries that support the practice but offers no history why is it that the maiden name is traditionally dropped when woman is getting married is this something that predates back many civilizations ago or is this relatively newfound trend im actually pretty curious as to why the woman would drop the maiden name
14325 castles were designed to hold people weapons and supplies to survive siege they were well defended taking one could easily be long bloody struggle why attack at all most castles ive seen could be trivially circumnavigated the resident soldiers would have to come out to attack bringing the conflict into the open and away from traps why didnt armies simply ignore castles and go around are there any examples of this approach succeeding or failing was the belief that castles are worthwhile based more on experience or imagination
14339 during ww2 germany owned ships along the eastern us coast with boats pretty much unopposed so why didnt germany head into us ports and destroy infrastructure why did they keep their actions out at sea for the most part if were calling the shots id be trying to be as distracting as possible by attacking high visibility targets all along the coast not modded shipping boats what gives

14402 during the 1980s envisioned primitive version of email that would come off telex machines that is person would sit down at keyboard create document store it on cartridge stick the cartridge into say telex machine send it to another terminal via modem and the receiver could either print it out on his telex or else download it to his screen and read it off the screen similar result might have been obtained using fax machines in either case the screen would have represented second delivery medium as opposed to just the fax or just the telex in actual fact email became common in the mid 1990s when the internet became commonly available what is it about the internet that made it the driver of email put another way why did it take so long for email to come into common use via the internet when it might have been made available through telex or fax machines perhaps years earlier
14412 the main language in the middle east is arabic however english and french considered as secondary language especially in algeria morocco and lebanon there are other countries people still use french daily and as secondary language the main question is when the ottoman empire conquered several countries why didnt they force use of their language the occupation period was long enough comparable to english and french occupation was the ottoman colonization different in this relation from french or the territory was in some way different than other african territories

14492 in joshbirks answer to the question hogwarts so why arent the kids doing it he claims that wartime atmosphere would decrease sexual activity in the students towards the end of the series books the overall tone and culture of the school is closer to that of one during wartime the possibility of getting blown up can be bit of dampener on romantic outings in comment on the same answer peteris makes the opposite claim wartime and the related fear emotional stress pressure would generally be an accelerating factor making teenagers reach emotional adulthood or the conviction that they have reached it faster in such situation it would be far more likely for teenagers to experiment and less likely to postpone or restrict things going off to war in either literal or figurative sense is powerful instinctive reason to have sex now while you still can wont dig for citations but both biology and historical evidence say during ww2 right before war went over those places supports this is there historical evidence to back either of these claims
14497 have recently read in the book of secrets that the first time the steam locomotive started in england no one was willing to sit in it even after being paid money to do so because no one thought it would stop once started in the end it was proved by having prisoners ride in it is this story true have my doubts since cant find any similar info on the web do you know what happened in england when the first train started no one was ready to sit in it no one many people were persuaded bribed they were given money to sit in the train but at the last point they escaped they said firstly steam cannot do such miracles such simple thing as steam cannot do such miracles and if the engine starts that means that the devil is at work somewhere the devil is running the thing it is not the steam and what is the guarantee that once the thing starts you will be capable of stopping it so twelve criminals from the jail were brought as passengers anyhow they were going to die anyhow they were sentenced to death so there was no problem if the train was not going to stop then the mad driver who thought that it was going to stop the scientist who had invented it and these twelve passengers who were anyhow going to be killed they alone would all be killed such simple thing as steam they said at that time but now no one says this because now it is working and you know it

14553 was reading this wikipedia article on the great depression of the 1930s this timeline mentions that in usa fed increased interest rates what was the reason behind this move read elsewhere that lot of gold flowed into us during and after ww1 after ww1 other countries wanted to buy more gold from markets us to go back to gold standard deflation followed ww1 as more goods were available now and lesser people to buy them so the interest rates should go down to entice people to borrow more but interest rates were increased why if the international demand for gold was higher the price of gold should automatically go up how does feds rate increase affect demand supply of gold what was the reason for rate increase what did the fed mention its reasons were think am missing something here request help for clarity on this point
14579 during the 18th and 19th century the british navy had ships all over the world and communicating with them had to be difficult after all the battle of new orleans happened after the british had signed the treaty of ghent ending the war of although many ship captains or fleet commodores had great freedom to operate tactically within their sphere of influence what system of communication did the royal navy use to pass orders and receive reports from its ships far away assuming that orders had to travel by courier on fast sailing ships did the navy rely only upon its own ships to pass messages or did it use fast commercial vessels was their back up system in case the courier was interecepted typically how long did the process take

14691 heard something like that once on some tv documentary but im second guessing that there must have been caveat for just the americas or otherwise qualified it as in modern history or as percentage of population or something know that the newly industrialized machinery was key factor lever action repeating rifle developed by the union late in the war what are other known civil wars across history that had more casualties edit after many hours of civil war documentary review trying to find the source much of the ken burns series and others found it death and the civil war pbs the american experience never before and never since have so many americans died in any war by any measure or reckoning thats not inline with the original question header but tried to acknowledge it to be false memory but having now just watched the show again youll have to forgive me the entire show is hyper maudlin and about the ugly details of mass deaths how it was realized and processed and the theretofore unimaginable scale of it if only all wars were as well served in documentary format vs various forms of thinly veiled heroic glorification
14706 the fullest form of the quote have been able to find online is from thinkexist com and goes as follows americanism means the virtues of courage honor justice truth sincerity and hardihood the virtues that made america the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life however the linguistic properties of the quote make it feel dubious that anyone would have ever said such thing in this way in the late 19th or early 20th century and have been unable to find any literary citations for the excerpt or any information about the original source did roosevelt or anyone of historical significance actually say this if not where did the quote come from and why is it always attributed to theodore roosevelt

14755 the united nations was formed at the end of world war ii to maintain peace throughout the world within the structure of un security council is ranked above all there were only five permanent members selected these nations includes us uk ussrnow russia france and china dont know what criteria was used for this selection but first four seems obvious to me us ussr were two superpowers emerged after war uk france were victors and former superpowers and were still controlling many colonies at that time but china doesnt fit in picture anywhere it was not superpower at that time neither it had strong economy or military as of today is it because china fought from victors side or is it due to its large population or is it selected as representative of asia
14858 somewhat related question did either of the world wars involve south or central america ive always been interested in why so many south american and central american countries took the side of the allies during wwii judging by the below map from wikipedia virtually every nation in the americas sided with the allies after pearl harbor countries shaded in light green only joined the war post pearl harbor know that few to none of these countries actually deployed troops but why on earth would countries like haiti or bolivia have dog in the fight to begin with could see countries bordering the pacific ocean being concerned about japanese supremacy but not caribbean and landlocked nations is it simply that the us influence over the americas was so strong it could push these countries into war

14911 how do historians study the events of jesus life and the person he was read book on the topic and it held the position that the gospels were revised to appease the romans especially the passion narrative if that is the case and they were completely rewritten im not sure how we got any historical information on the topic am not talking about the gospels am not talking about any of the new testament it was written after jesus death anyway the crucial detail that makes this question relevant to history lies in that want to know what primary source documents etc say about jesus and the person he was not what the bible says about him the biblical version isnt very accurate anyway as after the massacre of the jews in jews and christians alike both altered their beliefs about jesus to appease the roman empire and stifle any religious based revolution assuming that there is disconnect between strictly theological interpretation of the life of jesus and historical interpretation how do historians approach the topic what sort of historical methods can be applied to differentiate between these two interpretations

14992 one of the stated benefits of communism is supposed to be that the property of the extremely wealthy will be seized and redistributed however common criticism states that the extremely wealthy will simply take most of their wealth and flee the country and the only ones to be redistributed will be the slightly well off and the middle class im curious about the fate of the super wealthy russians during and after the communist revolution were most of them able to flee the country or otherwise avoid repercussions from the new regime were those that evaded the risk to their lives able to keep much of their wealth was their lifestyle impacted significantly

15011 tl dr version how tyrants hold power in general and how did stalin mean for example hitler was voted the enabling bill as the absolute ruler of germany and his will became legally law lets not debate legitimacy here but as far as know the supreme power in soviet empire was never delegated legally to stalin the supreme governing body was the politburo still somewhat how stalin controlled the politburo how could that have been motion for his instant dismissal taken with simple majority could have toppled his power instantly mussolini had that surprise when he convened meeting of the grand council of fascism but fact is the gcf was not convened unless mussolini wanted and his dismissal came after many years when the gcf was simply not convened still nothing similar happened in kremlin the politburo was convened regularly or quite often simple majority would have dismiss stalin immediately people in the politburo were quite harsh politicians so doubt about moral issues and cowardice they saw people killed around them so they must have some hints that theirs own lives are at stake simple vote would have suffice and the occasion presented herself many times was law custom what prevented such coup against stalin and what was the legal or maybe also the psychological base of his power why the politburo simply did not dismiss him but accepted quite easily even killing among its own members imagine others too were hungry for power other oligarchies that come into mind the khmer rouge regime the argentinian and greek juntas franco regime etc were never submitted to such degree to single person on larger scale how others dictators keep such tight grip on power for example when they are abroad any meeting could topple them still this rarely if ever happens thank you edit thanks to semaphore lets admit fear as reason but still the politburo members were the most powerful people in the empire and their votes counted as equal weight with stalins simple bill passed against him would have been enough think police and army would obey the new master even if bit reluctantly not much later krustchev denounced stalin and it was not general uprising against him so if it is fear what made the entire politburo so fearful so they accepted kills even among themselves mean the real reason they were people in room during meeting no arms no guns no monsters inside they were not handcuffed anyone could pass bill and it would have been over
15016 this question on politics se asks about the alignment of maps and got two answers the first mine says the split through the bering strait was chosen for practical reasons the second says that its due to centering on the prime meridian this led me to wonder whether the ease of splitting was deliberate factor in choosing the prime meridian or whether it coincidentally happened that halfway around the world was almost entirely ocean was this factor or just historical coincidence the wikipedia article makes it clear that it was chosen at the international meridian conference and provides some reasons but doesnt discuss this part at all
15023 the soviet union was famously restrictive place when it came to news and ideological spin and obviously their attitude toward the united states was less than supportive and warm the space race saw lot of competitiveness between the two countries but when the united states landed man on the moon the language they used was very universal they phrased it very much as victory for all mankind and there was lot of talk about all people on earth being one of course thats easy to say when you just won the race what was the internal soviet response to the news did the soviet citizens know it was happening at the time was it spun as victory for humanity or victory for the united states or loss for the soviet union or what was the story reported accurately or were details changed in the retelling

15086 conventional wisdom says that the ussr was very weak in in large part due to the purges of the 1930s ideological interference in the armed forces and lack of equipment preparation and tactical sophistication this is the usual explanation for the poor showing of the ussr in the winter war against finland in and the colossal defeats in the early stages of barbarossa later in the war it is said the red army recovered from the purges stalin learnt to interfere less and soviet tactical sophistication evolved but only later on similarly for time japan seemed unstoppable with vital areas of china as well as british american and dutch possessions overrun at tremendous speed in the early 1940s only later was she defeated by the might of fully mobilised united states and the vastness of china but only later so how then to explain the ussrs defeat of japan at the little known in the west battles of khalkhin gol in
15094 during battle of gaugamela darius now launched his chariots at those troops under alexanders personal command those chariots who made it through the barrage of javelins charged the macedonian lines which responded by opening up their ranks creating alleys through which the chariots passed harmlessly how can chariots which have relatively soft horses in front charge at phalanx bristling with spears how can phalanx open its ranks the warriors can make the sarissas vertical but how can they move fast enough to open the ranks before the chariot approaches okay they opened the ranks now the chariot is between them why does it not turn degrees and attack the broken up phalanx from the flank what damage chariot can inflict on the enemy crush into him but wall of sarissas should stop the horses scyth but this requires the chariot to run by the enemy which can just back away little bit like the open the ranks above warriors shooting arrows and throwing javelins from the charriot how can they actually hit target from such shaky platform
15125 the black hills lands claim is an ongoing land dispute between the us government and the sioux nation the treaty of fort laramie protected the hills from white settlement but the discovery of gold on the land led to its defacto seizure in and officially by congressional act in the legal struggle for the return of the lands started in the early 1920s under tribal lawyer richard case where he argued that the act of february was illegal and that the united states never made legitimate purchase of the land tribal lawyers marvin sonosky and arthur lazarus took over the case in until they won in when the case reached the supreme court united states vs the sioux nation of indians which upheld an earlier ruling that the act was in violation of the 5th amendment however in unanimous decision the sioux tribal council refused to accept the awarded compensation with the intention of forcing the us government to return the land thus the legal struggle is roughly years is this the longest legal case in the us or elsewhere or are there others go beyond this one
15144 babylonia developed numeric system advanced far ahead of its neighbors and some might say even superior to our contemporary decimal it was base system with convenient composition of factors for lower numbers and positional for larger numbers vastly superior to horribly unwieldy non positional roman and egyptian all signs point to it being widely spread it survives in more or less niche applications nowadays our time system 2x126060 dozen gross is quite prevalent in us cooking units and so on still currently the arabic system is prevalent throughout the world after period when other systems like roman were dominant what were the causes for babylonian system to die out
15167 matthew perry commanded the navy expedition that forced japan to abandon its policy of isolation triggering the eventual overthrow of the shogunates and the meiji restoration perry arrived in edo bay in to deliver letter from president fillmore and returned the next year to receive japans answer by demonstrating the overwhelming superiority of western technology he forced the japanese delegates to agree to his demands in the english wikipedia article for commodore perry it is mentioned that when the japanese tried to turn him away during the first visit perry ordered his ships to attack the habour with highly destructive guns that article cites as source arthur walworths book the black ships off japan the story of commodore perrys expedition perry ordered some buildings in the harbor shelled walwortharthur black ships off japan perrys ships were equipped with new paixhans shell guns cannons capable of wreaking great explosive destruction with every shell matthew perry threat of force and negotiation in contrast the japanese article says the cannons fired blanks and did not result in any deaths this seems to match what the naval history and heritage command says hich seems to suggest based on the wording of implied that the guns werent actually used on the japanese during this period the commodore remained out of sight in his cabin stating that he would consult personally only with direct representatives of the emperor the japanese procrastinated and equivocated the commodore stood firm supported by the implied threat of the squadrons guns he refused to move his ships to nagasaki he rejected gifts and compromises he forbade indiscriminate visiting by natives he herded their guard boats away from the anchorage always alert to the possibility of treachery he exercised his crew at battle stations daily brief summary of the perry expedition to japan the two versions seem to be contradictory moreover although the english wiki mentioned no deaths it followed the sentence by saying perrys ships were equipped with devastating gun which seems like they would have easily killed people had they fired so my question is is it definitively known whether perry attacked the harbour to forcibly open japan
15172 after the european re discovery of the americas there was widespread transfer of animals plants culture human populations communicable diseases technology and ideas between the americas and the old world primarily europe this became known as the columbian exchange some examples of this in the form of animals and food stuffs would be the potato and the horse before the columbian exchange white potatoes were unknown to the old world after being brought back by traders and merchants they were fairly quickly adopted as staple food stuff providing much needed starches although not completely related to just the potato blight disease the fact that potatoes were ruined as crop throughout europe in the 1840s was leading factor in the creation of the great potato famine of ireland this famine and admittedly other factors as well caused the population of ireland to drop by million from to instead of the expected raise of about million during the exploration of the americas the europeans brought many things with them including disease such as the domesticated horse with the horse the north american west was conquered indeed nothing is imo as american as the american wild west it can be said that some tribes of native americans became more accomplished at horsemanship than the peoples who brought them over really dont want to get into political meiji restoration or medical diseases discussion but would rather just discuss fun facts perhaps food stuffs or animals as discussed above were there any foods introduced into the japanese culture and accepted by them to the point of being called perhaps staple food what about any taken from them back to the old world were any animals introduced into japan by europeans that are now treated as part of the natural fauna of japan or the other way

15237 while back had disturbing encounter with someone related to jewish survivor from the auschwitz death camp this survivor apparently claims that not only red army soldiers but also perpetrated rape during world war ii while rape perpetrated by russian soldiers is often discussed what is the historical evidence behind the claim that the soviet armies perpetrated mass rapes during their stay in germany rape perpetrated by american soldiers is news to me is their any evidence that rape was perpetrated by american soldiers during wwii if so have estimations of the number of victims been made among the allies have other armies been involved numbers per country if available would be most welcome
15258 in some cases before the industrial revolution nobles and other elites had access to ice in regions where it wasnt naturally available how could they get it was it simply transported in big blocks from glaciers to towns and kept possibly underground and used quickly or were they actually capable of producing ice through some process im interested in any time before the industrial revolution and particularly interested in antiquity or the early middle ages

15334 even if we account for the argument that it is much more tedious to train man to use bow than musket why then did the arbalest not make comeback its effective range reportedly at 300m is still much better than smoothbore musket from the 18th century and is probably more accurate as well an army composed of 14th century arbalesters seem to have much more tactical options than an army of fusiliers so why did the crossbow not make comeback
15341 in the wikipedia article for the prague uprising implies that there were still large number of german troops stationed in czechoslovakia at least of them including crack ss armored units and even the luftwaffe given that at that date berlin was about to fall would troops and luftwaffe squad not at least made the soviet attack on berlin much more bloody and prolong the war for another few days

15364 wikipedia claims origins both in scottish and west african cuisine the problem have with that is that the story tend to see about the scots irish who immigrated to north america is that they settled the highland upper south not the deep south where the plantations and thus most of the west african slaves were so the two cultures may well have not had much chance to interact so how much contribution if any did the scottish and west african traditions of fried chicken really have with modern southern fried chicken
15374 the tendency of each generation to look fondly on the good old days and to disparage the next generation is well known remember reading some poem from ancient egypt lamenting the moral failings of the younger generation and it sounded exactly like something that might be written today but has the opposite ever happened has any generation on average developed consensus that the next generation was more ethical more worthy or simply better than they themselves had been

15447 the romans during the time of the republic were famously anti monarchical society there are plenty of stories of roman politicians gaining favor by refusing crowns or condemning kings etc as understand it even the first emperor octavian took the title princeps or first citizen so as to seem more palatable to the people who might not have taken kindly to him openly declaring himself king but at certain point you just have to face facts succession struggles inheritance single rulers who stayed in power until they died there is only so long you can go before you start to think you know the princeps sure looks like king when did the roman people finally acknowledge that their emperor was in fact an emperor the senate continued to be going operation for centuries but how long did it take for the public to admit that they effectively had king now
15469 legalistically speaking which side was right in the hundred years war my view is that the salic law combined with the principle that nobody can transmit right greater than he himself can possess nemo plus iuris transfere ad alium potest quam ipse habet should settle the matter in favor of the french at the time both england and france recognized the authority of the church were there any attempt at having the pope invited to adjudicate the succession amiably
15489 the image of hitler is very well formed in the modern public imagination stern stoic focused commanding and intimidating with powerful oratory skill and terrifying ability to stir up passion within his followers ask anyone to do hitler impression and they will immediately do one of two things shout and wave an arm defiantly or clasp both hands behind their back and glower he is an iconic villain and there is very little footage or testimony that have seen which humanizes him as anything other than stern commanding and deadly that being said we also know that hitlers public image was very carefully maintained public events were staged with care and precision personal information such has his family and his relationship with eva braun was withheld to keep him seeming larger than life etc hitler wanted to project an image of power and command both to his followers and to the rest of the world however on the flip side we also have bits of information about hitlers personal life that go counter to this image of the dour commander he was an artist for example and his paintings at least the ones ive seen have generally shown quaint tranquil even idyllic scenes he may have enjoyed doodling disney characters and he was huge fan of american popular cinema such as king kong and snow white taking both sides of this into account do we have any idea of what hitler was like in private was he actually stern man when he was with friends or was that simply facade obviously he needed some backbone to do everything he did but when he wasnt commanding armies or ordering construction projects did he ever relax and if so how do we have any accounts of his sense of humor or whether he was personally very funny person was he picky eater or foodie did he enjoy dancing did he tend to quietly preside over parties and gatherings or was he always the center of attention do any unbiased firsthand accounts exist of hitlers general personality and demeanor either during his time as hrer or before it
15504 ancient and medieval fortifications are often shown to have wooden gate doors in the midst of their stone walls now granted these doors are often massive and incredibly thick but it still seems like very risky point of weakness for an otherwise imposing structure splash of oil and flaming arrow seems like it could leave your castle with giant gaping hole in the wall in matter of hours and yet that didnt seem to happen or at least not regularly enough to require different method of constructing doorways through the ages attacking armies often had to bash down the gates with rams or scale the walls rather than going through the gates at all to get inside city castle or fort why was that what methods were used to protect the wooden elements of fortifications against fire ive heard of siege towers being covered by animal skins for that purpose but never fortification doors and while thick doors like that would take long time to burn through it still seems like it would be vastly easier to splash some oil and throw torch than to undertake more conventional siege methods unless as it seems that wouldnt have worked

15521 it is said that muslims fought for the american revolution by serving in the continental army wikipedia cites few names records from the american revolutionary war indicate that at least few muslims fought on the american side among the recorded names of american soldiers are peter salem yusuf ben ali and bampett muhamed http en wikipedia org wiki islam in the united states earliest records however wikipedia appears to say this solely based on their recorded names as far as can tell they seemed to be ex slaves who changed their names to the above after being freed it is of course quite possible that they were descenedents of muslim slaves who kept their faith and therefore chose to retain their real names upon freedom but wikipedia doesnt seem to offer any corroborating evidence peter salem freed slave who reputedly shot major johnpitcairn during the war has his own article but it made no mention of his faith one google result suggests he was muslim on account of his chosen surname which may have been taken from arabic couldnt really find anything of substance on the other two although their names indicate they did likely have islamic heritages guess my question is how reliable an indicator of muslim faith is having an arabic or islamic name in colonial america or more generally are there any real evidence of revolutionary war soldiers practising islam
15543 we all know that the holy roman empire was collection of minor germanic states in the medieval and renaissance europe wikipedia stated that the holy roman empire was multi ethnic complex of territories in central europe during the medieval and early modern periods until its dissolution in question which have been bothered and am sure most of you do is how exactly were their borders defined in two maps below the borders seems to sometimes cross another border furthermore the borders seem to be changing with time this first map is one of europe in the 16th century the holy roman empire is outlined in purple this second map is one of europe in references first map http www euratlas net history europe jpg second map http upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons 3b europe1700 png
15550 despite the fact that it never ended up happening nazi invasion of england was kind of common sense inevitability for while during the beginning of world war had the battle of britain gone the other way or whatever alternate history conditions you prefer nazi invasion across the channel was real possibility surely britain had plans for what they would do in that case can only imagine that they had numerous scenarios depending on how the invasion went down how did these plans match up to the german preparations how much detail do we know about how the defense of britain would have gone what tactics did they plan on using where did they anticipate the main battles to occur did the british commanders think they could successfully repulse nazi invasion of england or were the plans geared more toward slowing them down and making it not worth their while
15554 yamamoto famously advised against war with the united states because he could tell how powerful they would be once they got going the nazis however declared war on the united states of their own will as understand it fulfilling their treaty obligations to japan but without any immediate cause to fight the us themselves what was the plan there hitler had already picked fights with several pound gorillas in europe but at least all of them he could actually hit he had taken paris he was bombing london his tanks were already rolling across soviet soil etc but even by the end of the war the nazis werent able to make any substantive attacks against the united states itself at the beginning they must not have had any hope of even dropping payload of bombs on new york let alone destroying americas factories in chicago or colorado or texas was their plan literally just to declare war and then hope the united states got bored or tired and threw in the towel even if everything else had gone right if hitler had invaded britain and conquered the soviet union quickly he still would be facing huge enemy from half world away that he could barely even hit while holding down all his conquered territories at the same time did the nazi war machine have plan for such scenario were there sketches or concepts of an invasion of the united states maybe up through mexico or down through canada after britain was subdued did they hope to make v2s that could cross the atlantic or build carriers that could threaten the eastern seaboard were there discussions of peace treaties once britain fell or once the americans were kicked out of africa did hitler have any plan at all for dealing with the united states beyond hoping the americans got tired of fighting and if not why did even the ultra impetuous hitler consider it worthwhile to pick fight with an enemy he couldnt even reach

16614 ive been reading lot about the byzantine empire recently and one of the things see pointed out over and over again is that byzantine is term coined by historians not by the people themselves if youd asked citizen of the byzantine empire what he was he would say am roman in fact even the term romania as understand it came from these ethnically eastern but politically roman people remember hearing in my youth that the greeks continued calling themselves rhomaios even after the byzantine empire fell and that they only reclaimed their independent greek identity in the 1700s as response to increasing interest in ancient greece over in england and france is this true when did the greek and eastern european in general identity finally drop its association with the roman empire the only article ive found wikipedia only covers the earlier period not that which followed rhomaios

16639 one thing never understood about the soviet union were the famines and near famines those that were not explicitly engineered by the regime like holodomor how could nuclear power suffer from famines and near famines these problems with food production even continue to this day as russia has been huge importer of food from the european union until recently one would think that producer of technological wonders both during the soviet era and since would find definitive solution to these food production problems why was or has no definitive solution been found and implemented seemingly to this day agronomy hardly seems to be rocket science and also there was and still is lot of fertile land available edit chief among the famines would be the famine of when the soviet union was firmly walking on the nuclear path the first nuclear test was made in incidentally this was also the year when technological wonder the ak started being produced we can still read about this weapon in daily news among the near famines thought about the post ww2 bad harvests and systemic failures in agronomy that made grain imports necessary these might have developed into true famines

16694 gail jarvis in an encomium to the dunning school writes william dunning fervently opposed slavery but his reading of the trends of the times led him to the conclusion that the institution was coming to an end the slave trade itself ended in so for more than years before fort sumter was fired on no new slaves had been imported southern slaves began obtaining their freedom in the 1700s by saving money to purchase their freedom by performing services for the state or the local community some were freed for assisting in the revolutionary war and many were manumitted by the last will and testament of their owners for faithful service however have received different impression from my reading so far in particular if slavery was really fizzing out by itself how to explain the kansas nebraska act and the dredd scott decision which are usually understood as the slavers onslaught are there objective statistical studies on this issue jarvis words sound like fine rhetoric but find it suspicious that he carefully eschews quoting any figures update another influential historian who espoused similar views was ulrich phillips he concluded that plantation slavery was not very profitable had about reached its geographical limits in and would probably have faded away without the american civil war which he considered needless conflict
16699 the featured image of the wikipedia page for the black death is gif showing the spread of the bubonic plague throughout europe there are few places where the plague never spread to including the area around milan but most notably the entire kingdom of poland is spared even as virtually every other region is infected the wikipedia page itself just says the following the plague spared some parts of europe including the kingdom of poland the majority of the basque country and isolated parts of belgium and the netherlands but it never gives an explanation why poland would be spared was poland just lucky or was something else at play
16706 in the old west it appears that prostitution was viable means of making living perfectly legal or at least not prosecuted what was the status of prostitution in more established states in the east at what point did it become illegal in the west and why

16742 read an answer here that said the prohibition was imposed on cities against their will bit of research on google seem to say that it was pushed through because people didnt realize even wine and beer would be banned all in all it seems that many people were not very enthusiastic about prohibition but are there objective measures of just how much people supported or didnt support prohibition were there any opinion polls and how accurate are they
16753 was looking over map of where the nazis invaded and they never attacked sweden was wondering why since it seems like much better strategic move than invading russia why might they have chosen not to do so
16771 when the nascent united states was drafting and adopting its supreme laws several references to religion were made for example in the bill of rights congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof first amendment to the constitution of the united states there are also documents such as treaties testifying to the secular nature of the united states he government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion treat of tripoli and many of the states de established their churches inherited form england in the colonial era or in early decades but all these seem to have taken place within context of abrahamic religions for instance the treaty of tripoli above was clearly directed at the muslim eyalet of tripolitania this made me wonder whether contemporary americans understood their concept of free of religion as being applicable to non abrahamic faiths too for example that of the native americans so my question is did native religions come up at all when the united states was adopting religious freedom into its fundamental laws did americas founding fathers or their contemporaries consider native americans and their beliefs for instance was native religions mentioned during government documents or statements by delegates during the constitutional convention in philadelphia or during ratification federalist or anti federalist campaigning materials the federalist papers note that im looking for the legal concept of freedom of religions being actually applied for native american beliefs not whether the concept should have applied
16774 during the era of the landbridge across the bering strait evidence suggests that people traveled from asia to north america by foot becoming the first humans in the americas and the ancestors of the native american peoples that being said even today the bering strait isnt terribly wide about miles at its narrowest point roughly analogous to the english channel and closer than japan is to korea its not terribly hospitable environment at either end so travel might not have been considered worth it but given how humans tend to work their way into every nook and cranny of landscape it seems odd that there wasnt consistent if infrequent travel between alaska and siberia even after the landbridge disappeared is there any evidence for travel especially consistent back and forth travel between asia and north america before the modern age but after the landbridge disappeared and foot travel became impossible
16849 history book will tell you that the first world war was started due to the assassination of the archduke franz ferdinand and tangled mess of alliances and defensive treaties criss crossing europe and of course many of those countries had been vaguely itching for fight for while each feeling like their super modern weaponry made them unstoppable but these seem like poor motivators for kid from london or husband from berlin to go to war in world war there were many famous motivators on each side of the conflict such as the german resentment of the allies for their post war treatment or the american fury after pearl harbor maybe im underestimating the potency of those alliances in the mind of the common citizen but it seems like im going to enlist because one of my governments allies was attacked by one of my governments enemys allies because some random guy from one of my governments enemys allies countries was shot isnt enough to get many people to leave their wives and girlfriends when the boys marched off to war in or perhaps more importantly when the later boys joined the front in or what were they fired up about surely we have interviews or letters or even biased propaganda outlining the issues that the soldiers of each side considered the most important reasons for continuing the fight the french were presumably fighting to defend their homeland and the serbians and austrians no doubt felt the assassination hit quite close to home but what about the average german or british or russian or american or turkish or italian soldier in the trenches what were the issues that they felt were the most important reasons to fight or were they actually just that fired up about king and country what did contemporary chroniclers such as erich maria remarque all quiet on the western front or robert graves goodbye to all that have to say
16865 today there are many polytheists and neopagans who worship the ancient roman gods they are however very new development and not the descendants of an unbroken line stretching back to the roman republic there was long period unless im wildly mistaken when the gods of ancient rome were fully dead as christianity was rising though there was significant amount of time both before and after christianity became the official religion on the roman empire when christians and pagans lived side by side some of this was peaceful some of it was less so but at certain point there were simply none of the latter group left and christianity had aside from other religious minorities like the jews completed the conversion of the empire and of europe when did that happen what is the last reference we have to people worshiping jupiter mars venus etc preferably what is the last reference that is generally accepted as valid and not simply an accusation of scandalous pagan practices as way to slander christians name
16988 would like to know if the medieval people in britain by around ad knew that there was an empire that ruled britain several hundreds of years before otherwise were there any myths legends etc related to hadrians wall roman ruins writings or any significant trace of romans in folklore

17083 russian federation was certainly the biggest component after the collapse of ussr however dont quite understand why the very valuable geopolitical position as permanent member of un security council with veto power was inherited by russia alone rather than for example shared in some proportion by the countries that used to be the components of ussr or completely vacated more generally how exactly international agreements and memberships involving ussr have been decided after the collapse of ussr
17084 there are actually three questions first question it is often stated especially in english speaking media that the terms of the austrian ultimatum to serbia were unreasonable sometimes the demands are also summarized but emphasis is often placed on the minutes of the meeting between austrian ministers and winston churchills note that more or less state that the demands were unacceptable or even drafted to be rejected europe is trembling on the verge of general war the austrian ultimatum to serbia being the most insolent document of its kind ever devised ive long since wondered what these unreasonable demands that sovereign state cannot possibly comply with were so went through the trouble to actually read them and cant really understand which demand specifically was meant with those words could anybody help out second question the prosecution of those involved with the murder of the crown prince shouldnt be even demand that should be done anyway in any country with the rule of law murders just get punished ceasing propaganda against austria and shutting down terrorist organizations seams reasonable its not unlike the demand that us and nato countries actually demanded from iraq and afghanistan the austrians were even polite enough to issue the demands before mobilizing troops and offering to make an investigation and to issue formal declaration of war afterwards did the ultimatum have any reasons for being unreasonable that were specific to that time and its customs like prestige or some geopolitical implications that might not be culturally or politically relevant today and make it thus more difficult to understand why it was unreasonable third question also ive read on several occasions that serbia was willing to meet austria halfway but did not find any sources for this do you know of any sources that might state if serbia was willing to comply with certain points or to compromise on some issues or otherwise
17099 found top sniper list from 2nd world war which contains soviet soldiers and only finnish soldier namely stepan vasilievich petrenko vasilij ivanovich golosov fyodor trofimovich dyachenko fyodor matveyevich okhlopkov mikhail ivanovich budenkov vladimir nikolaevich pchelintsev ivan nikolayevich kulbertinov nikolay yakovlevich ilyin ivan mihailovich sidorenko and the only finnish man on the list simo yh the page claims the soviet union was the only country that had expressly trained sniper units in the decade leading up to the world war two and their superiority with the obvious exception of the top ranked sniper on this list is clearly displayed by the numbers beside the names of its marksmen what were the key factors of soviet sniper warfare success only training equipment if any of these factors matter why other countries didnt do the same tactics
17143 the traditional method of nominating candidates before in america was king caucus informal congressional caucus for the election william crawford was nominated by caucus and four other candidates three of which stayed in the race were nominated by other means by exactly what means were they nominated more generally what is the procedure for determining who is on the presidential ballot is there some office that the list is submitted to or some committee that puts their stamp on it or what
17172 what is the first example of western government passing sin or vice tax that is tax passed primarily to discourage consumption of certain goods due to moral not economic concerns protective tariffs and mercantilist policies therefore dont count states have long history of directly regulating consumption but im curious about when states first began to indirectly regulate consumption the first formal treatment of using taxes to reduce externalities that know of comes from arthur pigou in but obviously statesmen had long known that taxes have the power to discourage targeted behaviors think that hamiltons whiskey tax was overwhelmingly fiscal measure but he was at least aware that it had moral angle the consumption of ardent spirits particularly no doubt very much on account of their cheapness is carried on to an extreme which is truely to be regretted as well in regard to the health and morals as to the economy of the community so im inclined not to count the whiskey tax what is the first example of western government passing tax primarily to discourage immoral behavior
17183 in ptolemy and copernicus systems the stars were believed to rest upon single plane the celestial sphere people thought they were all the same distance away from earth keplers insight was about the orbits of the planets not the stars so when was it known to science that the stars are different distances away from the earth
17187 was there some law formed in us after jonestown mass suicide regarding religious or such kind of clique sect cabals or what actions were taken regarding limiting and monitoring cult activities by us government
17190 was reading the wikipedia on passports and there were numerous important dates in passport history but didnt find any date when passports became widely used documents for travelling see passports from late 19th century and general passports were regulated by league of nations in 1920s based on this my guess is that in the passports were used by almost all countries of the world my question is approximately when passports and border checks became widespread and commonly used procedures update adding more precision when became passports or its predecessor as travel document standard way to check travellers around the world
17207 recently learned that three clauses of the magna carta are still part of uk law the liberties of the english church the privileges of the city of london and the right to trial by jury think everyone understands the right to trial by jury and guess the clause about church liberties is there to prevent the monarch from meddling too much with church affairs but what are these special privileges that londoners been enjoying for the last eight centuries and why are they still enshrined in law quote the city of london shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and free customs both by land and by water we also will and grant that all other cities boroughs towns and ports shall enjoy all their liberties and free customs
17217 how many rounds of musket ammunition did the typical british redcoat carry during the c18th napoleonic wars
17230 did francisco franco who established catholicism as the state religion of spain consider hitler son of the catholic church who died while defending christianity if so why hitler acted contrary to what pope pius xi wrote in his march encyclical on nazism mit brennender sorge where it says whoever exalts race or the people or the state or particular form of state or the depositories of power or any other fundamental value of the human community however necessary and honorable be their function in worldly things whoever raises these notions above their standard value and divinizes them to an idolatrous level distorts and perverts an order of the world planned and created by god he is far from the true faith in god and from the concept of life which that faith upholds despite this francisco franco head of spain allegedly said on may adolf hitler son of the catholic church died while defending christianity it is therefore understandable that words cannot be found to lament over his death when so many were found to exalt his life over his mortal remains stands his victorious figure with the palm of the martyr god gives hitler the laurels of victory this is quoted on of this book hardly credible source which says it was published in the spanish press the day after hitler died which isnt may is it and in the last scene of this documentary but have never seen the original newspaper article is this spurious quote or does this reflect francos views of what hitlers religion is
17241 suppose you could argue its not uber important what they thought about war on another continent in which they had no direct stake but all the other countries in latin america couldnt afford to ignore it completely see american hemispheric perspectives on the spanish civil war vargas was in favour of the allies during the second world war and wasnt particularly troubled by distant ussr but did he follow salazar in supporting the rebels or just do nothing at all
17272 hannibal barca defeated roman legions in the battle of cannae at that time carthage also had control over hispania why did hannibal not seize rome at that time
17321 did anyone in ancient times lets say up to ad want to abolish slavery or even acknowledge the possibility that society could somehow work without it remember hearing once that aristotle imagined future in which there was no slavery because all their work was done by machines anyone im asking about people who were not slaves themselves wanting to abolish slavery there were at least three major slave revolts in ancient rome so its not like people didnt know that slaves didnt like being slaves
17339 after the french revolution the privileges of the aristocracy were abolished some nobles were executed others migrated but what happened to those who stayed in france did they live off what remained of their patrimony did they start working if so what kind of work did they do are there any records or statistics for where the french nobility ended up
17340 henry wallace was roosevelts vice president during wwii shortly before roosevelts death days following slow decline in health the conservative wing of the democratic party started an anti wallace movement to nominate anyone else as vice president for roosevelts third term thus selecting the unlikely truman as the next president of the us was this movement related to wallace being too soft on the new communist threat being too close to labor caused by his eccentric personality or political scandals what about wallace caused such backlash against him
17361 understand that at the conclusion of world war ii germany was divided into east germany under the soviet union and west germany under the western powers prior to the division was there any major cultural difference between eastern germany and western germany which made the eastern side more inclined toward or tolerant of the soviet union communism and totalitarianism another way of asking the question in we found modernized industrialized and economically vibrant west germany and east germany impoverished decaying and paranoid under the stasi was this due entirely to the two different systems which were imposed upon them or was there some innate difference between the eastern and western culture
17374 similar question was asked about only british monarchs the conditions in this question are the same but for monarchs world wide for the sake of this question tribal chiefs are not considered monarchs even if all hundred members of his tribe called him king the monarch must be ruler of state which is recognized as state by at least some other states it is important that he must have been the monarch at the time of the battle otherwise current british princes will become eligible to this position in the foreseeable future he also must have been an armed participant even if he didnt use his weapons and also not an accidental one so if the capital is besieged and he just so happens to be in the palace at that moment without taking part in the military actions it doesnt count if the monarch turns out to not be western european or american one then im also interested in the last western monarch to participate in battle
17418 as understand it the japanese plan for the pacific war was to grab bunch of territory then negotiate peace from position of strength did the japanese ever try to start those peace negotiations or did they go from grab territory to no longer in position of strength too quickly
17419 ive tried to find some information about it but failed lets say there is an educated slave living in relatively rich household of rome what would prevent him from fleeing going to some smaller town of some province to live there as free man its not like they had lists of all free citizens neither did they have proper identification documents such as modern day passport which would identify them and not every single slave wore collar which still can be broken
17429 im aware of the historically importance of rivers for earlier civilizations some of the most significant economies of the past were built on the bank of river would like to know if was it possible to navigate river against the current on medieval boat if it depends on the river im more interested on the douro river starting at oporto city portugal and going to spain valladolid what would be the requirements of medieval ship to get two people to make this trip if that was not possible would like to know if there was any value on walking along with the flow of the river and if it was common practice at the medieval time
17451 in the germans captured relatively small oil complex at maikop in the north caucasus and got within miles of larger one at grozny but the biggest prize was at baku on the far southwest side of the trans caucasus region on the caspian sea im assuming that the germans could not have captured it in and only with great difficulty thereafter historians like william shirer in the rise and fall of the third reich believed that the germans could have interdicted soviet oil shipments from the south by getting firm grip on stalingrad and choking off transportation in the volga river and for some miles beyond with regard to the first issue how close would the germans have had to approach baku to be able to interdict the oil from the source by bombing and how far were they from this hypothetical point in the caucasus with regard to the second were there viable alternate north south routes to the volga or could one have been built if the germans controlled stalingrad could this have been bypassed by night runs to avoid bombing
17508 what happened to the numerous patrician families of rome like the gens julia for example there are no ancestors today leading back to them like for example the famous medici family from renaissance italy cant think of any roman last names still in use what happened

17554 in this question one of the answers stated that actually states can interact well enough with their subjects in the villages without widespread literacy it helps to have someone literate who can read decrees to the peasants demand their produce or labor etc but that role can be filled by some intermediate class effectively tiny percentage of the population having too many literate people actually makes the system more difficult to manage was there ever literate ruling class which used the illiteracy of lower classed people as means of control
17559 how did the ussr parse and explain an ostensibly uber communist movement which was dedicated to overthrowing the leadership of the countrys communist party did they see this as trotskyism or some other kind of deviation the cleavage between the prc and ussr was firmly established by the soviets were major target of cultural revolution rhetoric what did the soviets say back
17598 how accurate were the maps before the invention of artificial satellites what was the most accurate map of the earth before satellites
17624 why is it that in the many biographies of alexander the great the lands where he ruled over is described as his empire but he is only king of macedon was he ever recognized in or after his time as an emperor the motivation behind this question is that remember chinese polymath once claimed that the title in is misnomer because alexander had never declared himself an emperor edit alternatively to make this question less vague and hopefully also less opinion based what were some of the most supreme titles that existed or did not exist alexander the great adopted him taking the meaning of great emperor rather than the more generic great ruler which could include great king also what the chinese call alexander the great
17704 the gospel according to luke says that jesus was born in bethlehem because his parents had to travel to their place of origin for census now in those days decree went out from caesar augustus that all the world should be enrolled this was the first enrollment made when quirinius was governor of syria all went to enroll themselves everyone to his own city joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea to david city which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and family of david to enroll himself with mary who was pledged to be married to him as wife being pregnant luke world english bible why not just count the people where they were as we do today are there non christian sources that substantiate the existence of such requirement or explain its purpose are there non christian sources that would cast doubt on this account or reasons to think that it was an invention by later generation that was concerned with linking jesus to david
17787 am trying to document my grandfathers participation in world war ii and have come across letter written by german military official informing my grandfathers parents that their son is missing in action the letter refers to the location of his last known whereabouts as kessel von trun und chambios on the 18th of august can only assume that this was in the vicinity of the western front at the time my grandfathers next correspondence was from pow camp in the uk but dont know whether he encountered us or british forces or other for that matter would like to know as precisely as possible where this took place kessel von trun und chambios translates to the cauldron of trun and chambios presumably in reference to an encirclement by allied forces at the time although dont know this for sure here is the contents of the letter verbatim with the names of my grandfather and his father replaced with xx and yy respectively and with notations in parentheses the letter is dated 2nd of december sehr geehrter herr yy bezugnehmend auf ihr schreiben teilt die dienst stelle mit dass ihr sohn oblt xx am im kessel vontrum sic und chamios vermi ist er befand sich auf einer cm selbst fahrlafette und versuchte mit dieser den feindlichen einschlie ungsring zu durchbrechen dabei fuhr er ohne beschossen zu werden an die gegne rischen linien soldaten eines nachfolfenden sic lkw wurden dagegen beschossen und hierdurch gewarnt es gelang ihnen sich zur batterie durchzuschlagen und haben vorstehende meldung berbracht sonst ist bei der batterie ber das schicksal ihres sohnes nichts bekannt heil hitler name illegible oblt battr hrer heres my best attempt at translation regarding your correspondence on the 18th of november the department informs you that your son first lieutenant xx was reported missing on the 18th of august in the cauldron of trun and chambios he was located on 2cm self driving lafette dont know what this is and attempted to use it to break through an enemy containment flank in this attempt he drove without taking enemy fire into the enemy lines soldiers in truck behind him took enemy fire and were herewith warned they were able to break through to the battery and conveyed the current message other than this information there is no further information known to us about the fate of your son can find city by the name of trun in france but cant find chambios let alone where this cauldron took place was really hoping to narrow this down to particular address or field but have no experience with this kind of thing and understand that this might be bit optimistic
17788 the main disadvantage of bolt action is that one has to remove the right hand from the trigger which leads to slower rate of fire neither lever nor pump have this problem rate of fire was viewed as an important military issue which lead to development of repeating rifles in the first place nevertheless all major ww1 rifles mauser lee enfield mosin nagant springfield tube magazine lebel were bolt action why the lever action mechanism does look flimsy not military grade strong when opened this guess might be the reason not to use it although the russians used winchester model but they were generally starved for weapons when firing from trench with the rifle lying on the breastwork the advantage of pump action obviously disappears and could even be liability due to dirt getting under the slider but no army planned to fight from trenches before the ww1 the bolt action rifles were using more powerful center fire cartridges in box magazines than the rim fire cartridges in tubular magazines usually used with lever and pump action guns this does not sound like good reason dont see why the slider in pump action gun cannot operate the same magazine as the bolt action so how come all the major ww1 rifles were bolt action why didnt they try to make pump action rifle with powerful long range cartridge its not impossible remington model
17825 it seems wwi and inter war ship designers went bit torpedo mad both in their fear of them and in their use finally coming to their senses in the harsh realities of wwii ive seen many examples of capital ships using extensive space and machinery to mount multiple torpedo tubes given the long range of their guns 20000m and up compared to the short range of the torpedo an optimistic 5000m this doesnt seem to make sense did torpedo fired from capital ship which im defining as heavy cruiser battlecruiser or battleship ever hit anything how many were ever fired in anger was it all just costly boondoggle some examples actually built tegetthoff dreadnaught deutschland cruiser admiral hipper cruiser scharnhorst class battleship nagato class battleship colorado class battleship
18849 came across this document on google books and am trying to interpret exactly what it is title berichte published from the bavarian state library pages my root question is what is this document and purpose at first glance it looks like it could simply be generic military field report reprimand or possibly even praise or award depending on the context in which the wording is taken based on the answer it will help me determine next steps if any to see if it might be of value for my research almost all documents in book have the same stamp and signature rulmann ass qua secret regime have used google translate and dict cc to do the very rough translation of but not able to translate the entire thing berichte translate to report proceedings or transactions according to dict cc page header umlagen shares in the cost gvm heit one from sr royal majesty of prussia meines ak lergn digsten herrn department of foreign affairs me issued eu supreme command shall the job wilh er joh wich schulz philip er wilh hayn und joh wilh krumscheid hereby is in all seriousness that fie not to further catch sr kin adjusted majesty accepted subject to those same of by his majesty ettionsauftrags with immediate ideas tthat what they highest only to the tompetente chste supreme court to refer behellige the supplicanren are as individual deputies banerngemeinen ohnehiy not authorized name of the whole tandes occur and it is most daring and jzrafbar if they are and on the basis of the judgment given insights kayserlichea mandates adopted maas rules in their immedjacen input un befitting expressions have erlaubet since king sr have already geruhet us own motion majesty graciously as previous st rtere cavalry etafchement by about half weaker infantry commando abl to let as such more grace supplicant as he ons hey its detachment sens permit always persistent constant threat permanent disability insubordination obstructiveness resistence have to expect
18877 as understand it germany did not make war with america on the condition that japan joined the war against russia was this because they thought that japan would attack russia anyway if so what basis did they have for thinking that or did they think they didnt need japan to defeat moscow
18952 related but more broad question why is such large percentage of jewish population worldwide in usa according to wikipedia the united states has higher proportion of jews than canada australia and new zealand all of these countries have very large proportion of people descended from people who immigrated in the past couple of centuries all have plurality or even majority of europeans plus people descended from europeans all have had prejudice against jews and europeans from countries outside of the western part of europe im not using western europe as these prejudices pre date the iron curtain and government actions that reflected those prejudices
18979 the purpose of the cruiser was to roam the high seas picking off merchant vessels troopships or stragglers of group so then why were heavy and light cruisers often attached to battleship or carrier groups and how was their purpose different to the attached destroyers
18993 ive read many textbooks and talked to plenty of people who explained to me that making thousands of rings then interlocking them is terribly expensive this confuses me because history had vikings covered in mail romans using mail until they managed to make interlocking strips work and it wasnt uncommon for even muslim warriors to use mail mail seems no more expensive than sword shield and helmet so what is the price of mail compared to other items of that time was it really as common as think it is
18996 the ancient greeks had their pantheon of gods whose significance vanished with the civilization some individual gods entered the belief systems of later cultures but such mutations are not what am concerned about here assume that even after the decline of ancient greece and the ascent of the roman empire at least some locals in greece still held on to their old religious practices on the other hand perhaps nobody in contemporary greece still worships zeus and the other ancient gods so when did the practice die out when did the last traces of worshipping of ancient greek gods vanish from history what do the sources say
19024 after columbuss voyage to the new world how quickly did this knowledge spread into the other parts of the old world for example when did the existence of the new world was common knowledge in laypeople or if thats too vague then in the rulers of various kingdoms in various european countries middle eastern civilizations indian subcontinent and china if this is too broad or too vague im particularly interested in the general awareness in indian subcontinent
19046 got little inspiration from previous post on the history part why were albanians the only nation in the balkans who converted to islam during the ottoman occupation does anyone know roughly how many ethnic greeks converted to islam during the ottoman empire and where are they now how many are left and do they have an identity
19055 if you see pictures of scottish officers in traditional dress sometimes they are wearing gold plaque hanging from chain around their neck it is usually kind of kidney shaped does anyone know what that thing is called below is picture of george washington wearing one around his neck
19077 recall way back in high school someone came to describe the american civil war show local artifacts that sort of thing remember them mentioning that muzzle loaded weapons had been found with as many as twenty think memory hazy balls loaded into them took it that this represented some sort of wider phenomenon than couple of odd weapons found at the time for whatever reason took away one of these mental pictures terrified by the horror of the situation the owner of the weapon compulsively loaded it too many times perhaps it wouldnt fire and its all they could think to do alternatively they used the excuse of needing to load their weapon to avoid the fray perhaps because their weapon was inoperational for whatever reason thought back to this this morning and wondered if there might be other scenarios in scrounging for weapons soldier would pick up found weapon and load it this doesnt make lot of sense because assume this weapon would explode if already loaded maybe for whatever reason this weapon was not meant to be fired at that time but to carry the balls and powder anyway its bit of riddle to me is it common artifact maybe someone has some insight on it
19098 typical decisive battles in roman times involve legions around men auxiliaries giving total of about men on the roman side only battles in even the late middle ages and early modern age typically involve men in total even alexander the great mustered over men in tiny greece with an estimated population of whereas mighty france with an estimated population of in the years before the black plague could only barely match that number at crecy given the increase in population over years later why did the early modern world not see more battles of ancient classical scale
19100 how many of them fought on in the free french forces and how many of them simply repatriated back to france
19141 after looking up some statistics it appears that former british colonies canada australia india new zealand south africa india singapore seem to be better of than colonies of lets say france morocco algeria germany cameroon togo the netherlands indonesia new guinea and belgium zaire congo of course compared to colonies in the neighborhood is there some consensus on this topic what are significant differences in how the british governed their colonies compared to other countries what made this approach more successful this question is not about the life conditions of the native people in these colonies which was in many cases dramatic bold rephrase of the question would could thus be based on historical evidence what conditions should one look for to pick good place and how should one manage that colony to be successful as thought experiment please dont take this question as provocation its more scientific research in what caused colonies to succeed or fail
19172 ive recently come across two quotes in very unrelated sources implying that for centuries the english and their colonial offspring did not appreciate the role of vegetables in healthy diet from religion and the decline of magic studies in popular beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century england the well known green sickness in young women to which contemporaries gave sexual meaning was chlorosis anaemia produced by lack of iron in the diet stemming from upper class disdain for fresh vegetables the well to do ate too much meat and were frequently constipated in the seventeenth century the poor may have escaped the gout and stone which plagued their betters and may even have had better teeth from eating more vegetables from jacksonian america society personality and politics during the cholera epidemic of among the quaint notions that flourished was belief in the the therapeutic qualities of beef and mutton and the evil effects of vegetables before and after the epidemic many people considered tomatoes taboo was already aware of anti potato prejudice but now it seems to me like disdain for vegetables was even more widespread even some vegetarians did not think much of the health benefits of vegetables according to an editorial in the index to good health michigan nothing short of confusion is produced when vegetarian declares to his friends that he does not eat vegetables generally he does eat vegetables when he first becomes vegetarian but very often as he progresses in the knowledge of the value of foods he comes to point where he thinks it economy of labor to live on fruits and grains and nuts discarding vegetables as not worth the trouble of consumption and digestion when did members of the english speaking world begin eating vegetables by choice instead of out of poverty when did it become conventional wisdom that vegetables were in fact healthy was this change attributable to any kind of research
19196 which politician or organization was the first to formally use the name democratic party for the party of andrew jackson when and where did this happen background thomas jeffersons political party was called the republican party by its supporters and the democratic party by its detractors the name democratic republican in this early period is an anachronism coined by waffling historians the followers of thomas jefferson almost always referred to themselves as republicans however the federalists nearly always called them democrats the republicans were also called anti federalists whigs and jacobins one term that was not used by either party during this time was the infamous label democratic republican neither the followers of thomas jefferson nor the federalists used this term it was invented by historians because they could not decide which term should be used to describe the party of thomas jefferson by the republicans were the only party that mattered at the national level when it came time to nominate presidential candidate in republican state parties failed to agree on single candidate and so the republican state parties split into competing caucuses the state caucuses that nominated adams called themselves national republicans or administration republicans to indicate that the national administration represented continuity with the republican party for example in rhode island the rival caucuses called themselves friends of the national administration and friends of jackson in most northern states pro jackson caucuses called themselves some variant of jacksonian party or jacksonian republicans in southern states where there was no significant adams wing of the republican party jacksonians just called themselves republicans by think the national party was calling itself the democratic party as were most pro jackson state parties at least in the north and mid atlantic states but don know when and where this renaming occurred want to know who formally named the party and when for two reasons the new name indicates not just acceptance but perhaps also desire that the adams jackson split in the party would become permanent the renaming implied that the old republican party was dead even though strictly speaking that was not yet fait accompli it was significant decision to use name that had in living memory been term of abuse whoever chose to use democratic was embracing the partys increasingly populist direction caution wont accept as evidence historian casually referring to the founding of the democratic party by martin van buren in even good historians can be loose with party terminology in this period and most just mean that in van buren created the national organization that would soon be known as the democratic party the answer may very well be van buren but like to see that claim sourced would be thrilled if someone found an account of convention or caucus where jackson men debated the merits of possible names for their party
19215 operation barbarossa the german plan to invade the soviet union was colossal success until stalingrad capturing one third of the european soviet union and having the luftwaffe taking monopoly of the sky encircling the russians in the ukraine all german success was neutralized in the soviet winter offensive even more it turned against them from where such radical turn point of the situation is it result giving allied aid to ports such as murmansk

19256 the aborigines are believed to have migrated from india in prehistoric times the maoris are thought to have arrived from polynesia and elsewhere in eastern asia they travelled by canoe its one and half thousand miles from nz to oz about the same as the distance between britain and greenland thats long way but nz is even further away from the islands that the polynesians travelled from did they ever visit australia and meet its people
19283 as late as ww1 there was very little literature surrounding ptsd shellshock in fact the term was not coined until the 1980s considering the fact that warfare has been part of human life since time immemorial why is ptsd only being discussed about now did people of earlier eras not suffer ptsd as much since violence and death was big part of their daily lives
19308 just heard on the news that in countries girls face risks by simply going to school and being girls how did women come to be second class citizens throughout the world are there any relatively non controversial historical explanations for the origins of gender inequality
19319 ever since the inception of the soviet union the central government continued to maintain the existence of national republics such as the uzbek soviet socialist republic what was the reason behind that decision why didnt they attempt to completely assimilate the local peoples
19326 for example the american operation name for the assault on okinawa was known as operation iceberg however okinawa is relatively hot area of japan and as far as know there were no icebergs or snow anywhere close to there not even in that season so based off of that example do military operation names ever have any correlation to the op itself does the name itself convey any meaning or do they just pick random word to describe it
19358 how old is the oldest written work where we have translated what is written on it in correctly that is verified sigh ive tried writing that sentence in way that is understandable and am having trouble which is fairly ironic guess im looking for the current demarcation of prehistory to history but from the standpoint of writing that we have successfully translated beyond we know someone wrote these symbols but dont know what they were trying to say ive read the wiki page on prehistory and it says while in the past prehistory was that time before writing many historical scholars are moving beyond the writing and into artifacts im currently interested in the oldest translated written works
19359 recently watched documentary on the roman colosseum that described some of the brutal and cruel violence that took place the documentary explained that for the citizenry the violence was justified and acceptable through their relationship with the violence associated with romes imperialism however were there any notable critics at the time

19413 according to guy on quora english became the lingua franca of the world because of the united states and not england but throughout the 17th and 18th century many europeans english french dutch spanish scottish swedish made their settlements there but the us speaks english why because english was more powerful than any other european nation in us at that time how were they powerful because most of their revenues they used for their military came from india there is not enough money in the enitre england to repay india the money they looted from here so if france had been successful in india suppose even they would have been indifferent to india is this true if france had been the nation that managed to successfully rule india would we be using french on this site
19437 how did people cut their toe and fingernails before we got nail clippers after the industrial revolution would they have had fair amount of ingrown toenails especially in the colder regions where feet had to be kept wrapped up

20520 how large factor was the economy failing and rome facing bankruptcy to their downfall when you compare it to the likes of political corruption and the rise of christianity
20544 if we look at the map of ming dynasty we see much smaller china most of the northern and western part of todays china was conquered during qing dynasty in contrast many european powers have lost most of their lands which they have conquered after 17th century this seems strange to me late modern china has lost almost every wars with european powers and has lost many lands in all those peace treaties also late modern china had long period of extreme chaos and fragmentation which made it even more fragile if were in late 19th or early 20th century would have expected that china would be gradually eaten up by western powers and maybe japan also but this did not happen so why could china keep most of the lands but the more technologically superior european powers could not despite winning every wars with china
20600 when was the new kingdom of egypt 1550bc to 1077bc first called new kingdom or something cognate
20603 why did native americans die of european diseases while europeans didnt have serious diseases from the new world read that most native american victims of colonization in the new world died of european diseases and not by battles but why didnt european people catch some deadly disease from native americans was it because of better european immunity was it because europe had better experience handling diseases or what factors played major roles in this historical exchange of bacterias and viruses
20684 when romulus augustus was deposed by odoacer it is said that the imperial insignia was sent to constantinople always wondered what kind of objects this was and if it survived in any form if it did where is it now
20685 recently came across this wikipedia page of lalitaditya muktapida the map in the page shows an enormous empire of him stretching from china to anatolia as far as can make out in relatively well documented period of history ad this surprises me because this period was dominated by muslim armies and had never heard of such vast empire based off kashmir before in spite of me being an indian so my question is is the map in that page accurate or perhaps did he rule over much lesser empire
20702 recently heard big claim from muslim that the italian renaissance was largely caused by the positive islamic influence on europe via spain or al andalus have my doubts about this claim traditionally historians give most credit to the greco roman past of europe as the inspiration for the age can someone elaborate on this topic because the renaissance is pretty much the catalyst for the modern world have heard the claim from my muslim friends and most recently on youtube video called the iphone and the prophet muhammad
20729 some internet sites including those of more dubious and conspiratorial nature have been posting this rather ominous quote the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes they attribute it to felix frankfurter us supreme court judge in the early 20th century quick search on wikiquote gives the following information the earliest source for this quote was published years after frankfurter died by ratibor ray jurjevich the war on christ in america christian fortress in america under siege christophobes of the media and of the supreme court in action attributing it to felix frankfurter as an agent of the anti american conspiracy there is no earlier attribution to anything remotely this quote even in equally conspiratorial and antisemetic works marking this as the date when this quote was manufactured bd2412 my question therefore is did felix frankfurter actually say this quote or was it manufactured if he did say it what was the context behind it
20735 if we go back sufficiently far in human history we will most likely see that any descriptions of supposed aliens are described solely in religious terms so in the distant past any weird or unexplainable considering the level of knowledge or willingness to search for answers in religion events were probably more often or always attributed to gods or spirit beings of one sort or another anyway somewhere along the historyline the human mentality changed and the concept of space aliens started to be used for some of these events what is the earliest mention of space aliens as non religious beings in literature
20757 source erich von manstein died of stroke on the night of june at the age of as the last but one surviving german field marshal he was buried with full military honours his funeral attended by hundreds of soldiers of all ranks source gerd von rundstedt was buried in full uniform in hannover st cken cemetery the ceremony was attended by over people mainly army veterans the german and lower saxony governments paid no official attention to his death had he lived longer this might not have been so manstein was buried with full state and military honours in despite being convicted war criminal ask about erich von manstein here and entitle my question as such due the bolded above
20769 have been hearing that the fall of constantinople was the most important event that ultimately led to the age of exploration mainly the discovery of the new world by columbus and of the sea route to india by vasco da gama however from what know ottoman turks had surrounded the byzantine empire for quite some time before they actually managed to win the legendary city of constantinople byzantines in their last few years were hanging on to very tiny land around constantinople and turks had already gained their foothold in europe so is it not true that this conquest of was merely prestigious event this might be an exaggeration but you get the idea furthermore the ottoman turks wasnt the only islamic kingdom that stood between europe and the other end of silk route namely india and china the area to the east of byzantine empire had been controlled by islamic kingdoms and caliphates for almost years before the fall of constantinople and yet the silk road existed during that time then why would the fall of constantinople and the byzantine empire be the last straw that broke the camels back or is it really true that because of this europeans got worked up and ended up discovering sea routes to india and the new world
20809 remember reading in magazine that the biblical apostle james the greater visited ireland years before saint patrick is it true that he went on mission to northern ireland forgive me if overlooked something but if google anything about the apostle james in ireland bunch of saint patrick day crap pops up is there book someone could point me to that tells about this optional
20844 the shapes of the nder territories in germany were very complicated there was hundreds exclaves and enclaves all over the place to the point it became ridiculous notably the shape of prussia which covered most of the territories of northern germany had many smaller enclaves of other nder in its territory and small exclave in southern germany which was very distant form the rest of prussia the thuringia region was also incredibly complicated with mix of prussia and various other states all over the place this leads me to couple of questions why was the division of territory within germany so complex since prussia was pretty much doing what it wanted in germany why didnt prussia just take over those tiny states that are entirely encapsulated within it to simply cover the entire north germany why was this changed after wwii and why wasnt this changed after wwi
20862 have seen many medieval helmets that looked like this why did they have that metal thingy between the eyes what is the point to me it would be harder to see if had something like that there it would block my field of vision
20878 would like to know why the romans the emperor honorius in this case didnt use the roman army legion according to the notitia dignitatum there were still many legions around the western roman empire that could have been used to defeat the alarics goths however honorius had extended and unsuccessful negotiations with alaric at the point of thinking to flee ravenna this scenario ultimately led to the sack of rome but the question is could this have been avoided by using the army if thats the case why didnt the romans do so this question seems to be duplicated with where were the western legions when the roman empire fell but am pointing exactly to the siege of rome of whereas the other topic addresses the fall of the roman empire
20889 came across this quote in an interview with british philosopher jonardon ganeri what would add is that philosophy did not have single origin but many origins around the world and each of those roots produced outgrowths of philosophy that merged and tangled with each other in the course of human history there were buddhists in alexandria and rome and there were sufis and europeans in india the old story that as philosophers we are the children of the greeks had particular function largely political at particular time but it doesn make much sense in the modern world it inspires this question about history what in particular do we know about individual buddhists in alexandria and rome what traces if any have they left in recorded history
20898 was thinking about this question just asked and wonder whether the potential destruction of such an iconic building is even realistic fear has there been any incident of deliberate destruction of an iconic building its kind of world heritage type structure in an official war between nation and nation what mean is during war between nation and nation nation is invading bombing nation and deliberately destroys famous building of nation does this still happen in the 20th century and later if yes then how does the attacking nation justify such acts note that this does not include terrorist organizations or internal destruction for propaganda purposes so incidences like destruction of this russian cathedral buddhist statues and nimrud are out edit and to make it more clear lets exclude the destruction of iconic buildings monuments when there exists pure military reason mean an enemy using these building for military purposes like armed people hiding in temple and let us exclude collateral damage when there was no intention to destroy an iconic building so that ceasars burning of the alexandria library would not qualify and the destruction of the parthenon will not qualify the examples will be less abundant and more interesting
20908 working with census data and other 19th century sources occasionally come across the occupation of boat crimper cant figure out what these boat crimpers do based on the definition of crimp it could be fairly innocuous term for someone who works with wires and cables on boat but the wikipedia article for crimper takes you to the article on shanghaiing shanghaiing refers to the practice of kidnapping people to serve as sailors by coercive techniques such as trickery intimidation or violence those engaged in this form of kidnapping were known as crimps but im skeptical that the boat crimpers find in public records are crimps as in this definition heres joseph magee who lists himself as boat crimper in the rochester city directory who would list themselves as kidnapper so do any of you naval historians out there know what kind of occupation boat crimper was assuming crimpers are not crimps were crimpers skilled semi skilled or unskilled labor

21052 while studying the history of eastern europe during the last century found that one of the main issues was the pan slavic movement for example big events such as world war or the current civil war in ukraine was consequence of this movement such movement consider people descendant of the slavs as members of international community which currently has the foundation and direction in russia interestingly such feeling did not develop in others civilizations for instance spain france and portugal cultures are somehow descendants of the roman culture but there is not such thing as pan latin movement there are several accusations stating that russia is enhancing the pan slavic feeling for the purpose of expanding their influence is this realistic statement if so was it the case for the past century or if not is the pan slavic movement just natural consequence of the nations finding an identity

21201 know its not good to take video games word for it when it comes to history however in the game company of heroes the german team can deploy an ostwind flakpanzer iv which to my understanding was an anti air gun on tank chassis in the game the flakpanzer is used almost exclusively as an anti infantry tank my question is was the flakpanzer iv or any other german anti air gun used against infantry if not was there different type of tank used to counter infantry
21217 many states within the usa and canada have straight lines as border completely ignoring natural borders like mountains or rivers many american states and canadian provinces are just rectangle shaped and good half of the us canada border is made of two straight lines one vertical and one horizontal why was it decided to make it like this understand the colonizers made arbitrary decisions initially by why didnt they pick more natural borders for example following rivers and mountains

21266 much has been made in other posts about how hard it was for european armies to train and maintain large numbers of archers able to use longbow crossbow or similar weapons yet the mongolians were apparently able to do that with the majority six in ten of their own horse riding soldiers but not foreign conscripts as archers only the english but not other europeans appeared to approach this ratio how was this possible were the mongolian bows simpler or easier to use than the european bows or did their nomadic way of life horse and cattle herding make it easier for them than europeans to learn and use archery
21275 and if not what is it that makes people comfortable reenacting the american civil war it would seem grotesque to reenact the rwandan civil war or yugoslavian civil war for example in particular what is the most recent civil war that people are comfortable reenacting
21276 in the world at the moment the most popular religions seem to mostly be religions that worship only one god such as christianity and islam however in the past there were many religions that worshipped vast number of gods such as norse greek roman chinese etc is there historical reason why these older multi deity relgions were replaced with religions that worshipped singular god and if so when did this occur
21281 during wwii before it became clear the nazis were going to lose is there any especially noteworthy examples of member or members of the nazi party defecting to the allies im aware noteworthy is fairly ambiguous but im not really sure how else to phrase the question
21304 how was the current month and day disseminated to the townspeople of the medieval europe im quite sure that personal calendars werent thing back then but could be wrong if they had shared calendar where was it stored and how did the information of the date get to the people from that location think it wasnt newsprint as oldest newspapers has the oldest european newspaper start in it might be avvisi the precursor of european newspapers but those only existed from 1500s onwards and mainly for italy
21372 how did the industrial revolution affect the production of this commodity what if any affect did the great depression have on the industry
21376 in his letter to charles hernan cortes states that it was only necessary to threaten to return them the natives to their native masters in order to make them serve the spaniards very willingly source the encomienda in new spain the beginning of spanish mexico pp is there evidence other than cortes own view which is obviously biased to suggest that some native americans did in fact prefer spanish rulers
21447 the southern german states of baden rtemberg and bavaria were independent states until their historical background is quite different from the northern germany which was dominated by prussia at that time the southern states have always been on the side of austria and france rather than prussia mostly because of their predominantly catholic culture otto von bismarck which was often described as having very strong imperialistic military and expansionism policy wanted to annex those states but the monarchs of the southern states were hostile to that idea he tricked the southern states to help to defend prussia against france that he is accused to have himself provoked on purpose in and used their victory to proclaim the german empire charles the 1st of rtemberg and frederick the 1st of baden were hostile to prussias imperialist policy and ludwig ii of bavaria was so much opposed that he boycotted the proclamation of the empire which is to say how unified germany can be seen as an illegitimate state from the very start from any time past this unification it would have been easy for those states to claim they were victims of prussian imperialism and ask for independence on historical grounds for example after germanys defeat in many new independent states that either disappeared long time ago or never existed were re created for example poland after years of political non existance it would have made perfect sense for southern german states which were forcefully unified only years ago to claim their independence after wwii germany was completely defeated and ceased to exist politically the allies re created the frg the gdr and austria couple of years later but were careful that the state of prussia was dismantled as prussia is what united germany and is associated with strong military and nationalist culture and thus the rise of nazism it would have made perfect sense for the allies to split the former 3rd reich into more sovereign states based on the fact that prussian unification is the root of german nationalism and two world wars during the cold war since the united nations were created small independent states have almost as much political power in international relations than bigger states because they have seat no matter what their area and population is having more than german speaking states on the capitalist sides could have been good way for the western allies to have more influence against the communist block and in particular the gdr since the territories of the former third reich were doomed to be split in multiple states anyway nobody knew that the gdr was going to disappear and austrian anschluss is reminiscent of nazism it would have made as much sense to make it split in an historically justified way what made the allies separate austria from germany and split off east germany mostly the former prussia from the rest of germany without doing the same to bavaria wurtemburg and baden
21502 am writing story about soldier who survived from an ambush and he hide several days then he walked to village while he is on the waywalking on road he saw caravan so my question is in the roman era did the caravans or passing people riding horses simply give strangers ride if they have the same destinationgenerally speaking mean on our modern era auto stop is common on general many trucks would stop for strangers at least thats what we see on tv because in the ancient times bandits were everywhere but also in our modern era criminal can hijack truck that contain lot of food anyway this soldier can have auto stop or it didnt exists in that time
21540 am watching the vikings series and although dont consider it historically accurate series noticed somethings that am curious about the series takes place in the late 8th century documenting the first viking raids against england what noticed was that the raiding parties were so small mostly one or two longships carrying men at most yet their raids were successful and they didnt encounter strong enough forces to fight them off now my question is what happened in reality how large were the raiding parties in that time and why the entire england couldnt raise an army large enough to fight them any figures for the population of scandinavians during this time would also help
21561 one of my interests is attempting to understand what human experiences were like for individuals in the past want to learn about their day to day lives their fears their aspirations and what their world view was does field of study which attempts to document and convey human experiences across periods and demographics exist and what is the name of this field the closest have been able to find is social geography but that seems to be rather poorly defined field with little emphasis on historic experiences
22664 the first world war in the west was for years restricted to trench warfare gaining enemy territory cost many human lives for both sides the main or maybe most spectacular battles were verdun and somme both which led sources vary to combined loss of million men the war was won by the entente because of many factors but the most important seem to be the usa joining on her side and the bad economic conditions of central powers new weapons should also not be forgotten planes and tanks the national catastrophe made france to adopt defensive strategy maginot line phoney war although tanks had been first used in battle in they did not play the main role in ententes victory they however did in during the german conquest of france and later they became the main land force on flat terrain world war battles lacked trench warfare some exceptions are given on wikipedia page it was present in fortified islands on the pacific where terrain prevented mass use of tanks in later conflicts it was also infrequent think that the development of air forces is another form of artillery the only reason can think of are the tanks tank is major step in firepower armour race and also provides mobility to attacking forces blitzkrieg as the top example were tanks the only reason for the ending of trench warfare or are there any other factors
22680 my understanding was that finland was not really pro nazi germany but merely wanted to recover the lands lost to the soviet union in the winter war of that is the enemy of my enemy is my friend my further understanding was that individual leningraders had chance of obtaining food by going to the border with finland and trading valuables for food with the local farmers with minimal interference from finnish soldiers at any rate the finns appeared to be lot more humane in the conduct of the siege of leningrad than the germans given the context of the time was there chance that the siege of leningrad could have been lifted on the finnish frontier if the soviets had offered to return the lands taken in the winter war my understanding was that stalin once considered offering finland peace on those terms then re considered when the troops brought back from siberia started winning the battle of moscow would peace with finland have helped leningrad or did transportation issues mean that most supplies for leningrad would still have to come from the southern german controlled direction
22705 if am not mistaken people in the past tended to have enough offspring so that they increased the population of their family until the maximum sustainable population was reached due to the lack of birth control and what have you since the upper classes tended to have large amounts resources why didnt they keep increasing their population until they reached the maximum sustainable population which would make them quite poor did the upper class simply not stay in power for long enough for them to become overpopulated did people not want to reproduce as much as think they did havent found anything discussing this after googling it
22711 according to the wikipedia article on calvinism although much of calvins work was in geneva his publications spread his ideas of correctly reformed church to many parts of europe it was influential in france lithuania and poland today the vast majority of lithuania and polands religious population is roman catholic the protestant minority is surprisingly mostly lutheranism the relative insignificance of calvinist church in poland do not appear to be related to the recent atrocities of world war ii as it is clear in the polish census espcially page that the protestant were already in minority representing small percentage of polands population the german speaking population was overrepresented in the protestant population about of protestants were germans only were poles which explains why protestantism lost even more influence in poland after wwii and the expulsions of germans and that in addition to the atrocities targeting specifically poless upper class including of course clerics the vast majority of protestants were lutherans including in the polish speaking population it appears that unfortunately the census is particularly confusing among difference trends within protestantism but here within protestant only of ethnic poles and of population declared themselves as other than lutheran so unsurprisingly germans were mostly lutherans what is more surprising is that poles were also mostly lutheran going further in the past back in the polish lithuanian commonwealth it appears that protestantism had much greater influence than today as it had of the population and probably much greater percentage among the nobles situation very similar to france at the time before persecutions against the huguenots began however since poland had long tradition of religious tolerance dont see any sign of significant discrimination against protestants by other non protestant poles my question is when and why did the influence of calvinism decrease in poland
22727 have overheard the story from an us soldier that during the pacific war the japanese mounted defense in an old medieval castle the americans asked for support from battleship the battleship successfully shelled the fortress only to find out that the castle was able to withstand battleship fire now if you know how big battleship guns are you me and the other people are thinking he is pulling our leg but he insisted that this is true and they finally called special ship with guns and extreme high explosive grenades shells which was able to tear the castle down does anyone know if there is grain truth in this story google fu failed
22763 two history professors in my school say that hitler had to execute the leaders of the sa principally because the generals of the german army asked him to do it the generals were teutonic nobility the leaders of the sa who were pedophiles homosexuals criminals in one word scum so the generals explicitly stated that otherwise they would not have accepted hitler as their hrer in other words according to the professors getting rid of hitlers opposition was not the first purpose of the nlk however couldnt find sources backing up those claims and furthermore my professor himself disagrees are they correct
22770 when watching movies that were made in first half of the 20th century one can see many people are smoking cigarettes but it is not they smoke all time long refer to the movies because they show the eras fashion and habits cigarettes are shown because they were part of lives but they are not much common that everybody smokes every time they play important role eg no one could imagine humphrey bogart or james bond without it in some scenes but they are not existing the entire movie in mad men series which was made few years ago but action takes place in 1950s the people smoke everywhere we see pregnant woman smoking even gynecologist smoking by his patient understand that people did not know everything about health problems caused by smoking but am not sure if this is not exaggerated as compared to movies from that time ive spoken to some older people and they say it was not true but it could have been in the usa from remembrances they say yes everybody did smoke it was common to smoke at home by children at office but it was not allowable both by law or habits in other public places hospital cinema etc do mad men show truth about people habits and are intended to shock the viewer how common it was the movies from the era could have been somehow censored or directors did not show cigarettes because it didnt add anything to action or they had theater habits where it was forbidden to smoke on stage because of fire security reasons or maybe the authors of mad men wanted to show something shocking but unfortunately they exaggerated it ps loosely related blog post
22788 was surprised to find it stated in the laws of north carolina chapter section ix that tax to the state of ten pounds shall be paid does this refer to british pounds would have assumed that by the official currency in use in the us would have been something other than the british pound
22801 while there are many articles discussing the australian aborigines de facto legalized slavery or essentially free labor the fact seems to be that they were never de jure slaves as africans were why didnt england press the australian indigenous aborigine population into actual slavery
22841 when white men came to mainland north america there were an indigenous population already here will refer to that population as north american indians africans were brought to the americas eventually as slaves talk to an average white man in the south point at group of black men african americans negros and he could be expected to think slaves why didnt america or the english before the american revolution think of or write laws to the effect that the indigenous north american indian population as slaves note im not asking why didnt they enslave american indians just why didnt they view them as think of them as slaves
22845 ive frequently heard it stated that people used to marry at much younger ages historically recently these kinds of statements have tended to show up in sociological discussions about young people choosing to get married later many such studies tend only to trace data back through the 20th century often stopping at or so when age at first marriage was particularly low in historical studies of marriage the more common statistic seems to be the age of consent for marriage which was often lower than today but those numbers tell us little about the average age that most people married ive come across few references here and there which have tried to measure actual marriage ages historically and they often seem to come up with numbers that are perhaps surprisingly higher than we might expect for instance in 17th century england wikipedia notes that survey of marriage certificates showed the average age for brides was years and years for the grooms ive seen number of other sources which have indicated that first marriage ages were often in the early to mid 20s in parts of western europe in the past few centuries obviously this can vary significantly by region as well as time period based on data like this my sense is that our perception of young marriage ages has been skewed by selection bias we know more about aristocratic families and they tended to arrange marriages at particularly young ages for political reasons moreover at least for the it seems we may have met local minimum of median age at first marriage in the 1950s if these statistics derived from census data are to be believed data like this has made me wonder if our perception of younger marriages on average is historical myth or at least needs significant qualification perhaps based only on our perception that parents and grandparents may have married younger on average than current generations but were the mid 1900s actually historical outliers or at least part of more complex picture in sum prior to the last century or so what evidence do we have for the statement people used to marry at much younger ages in general some historians have asserted that people even used to marry basically upon reaching puberty is there evidence to support or debunk such claims obviously there are plenty of historical examples of marriage at young age but does that also relate directly to similar trend in median marriage ages or not since marriage records legal issues and customs in western marriage have varied by time and region over the past years or so since the beginning of some regulation and standardization of western marriage do we even have enough information to speculate on such general trends over time how much variance is in the data and if we can observe any broad trends what are they realize the answers here may vary significantly by region im particularly interested in europe as well as the canada but data on other regions could be interesting as well edit ive edited the question somewhat to try to make clear what im asking for here do not expect general history of world marriage ages over the past years however if anyone can point to reputable external resource that surveys such information that would obviously be superior contribution toward answering this question began the question with common historical claim about an overall marriage trend and im interested in whether actual historical data supports that claim in general or whether there are other general trends or whether its all so inconsistent that we cant make any useful general observations
22888 on my great uncles naval entry form it says occupation upon entry slitterman paper found this article which says slitterman is representative for the travellers aid society can anyone explain this in more detail specifically what does the paper part mean note he joined in he would have been about
22971 this article goes into some detail about the state of cooking in the union and the confederacy during the american civil war one of its interesting claims is that the south was suffering from lack of salt which greatly limited their ability to cure and preserve meat it states that much of their salt had previously come from wales but that had been cut off by the union naval blockade why would the south be getting its salt from across the atlantic why wouldnt they make salt from seawater in the coastal regions and ship that to the various parts of the confederacy
23026 for two decades revolutionary france had attacked and conquered many nations in europe millions were killed but when the allies finally defeated france the peace was very lenient france didnt lose anything apart from what they conquered during the wars why were the allies so lenient towards france which logically should have been hated enemy especially since france was such powerful enemy shouldnt they want to weaken france

23052 in the first scene on master and commander after the ship beats to quarters theyre shown lowering three rowboats and towing them behind the ship why do they do that
23118 it occurred to me today that all essential historical exploration was done by the europeans who discovered the americas and mapped most of the world this got me wondering about eastern civilization they knew about europe since we had the long silk road land route so they knew there was much more to the far west along land but did they ever wonder what was beyond the ocean to the east did the japanese chinese or other civilizations of that region ever send voyages out into the pacific or were they very inward focused
23126 during the first naval battle of guadalcanal an american flotilla of five cruisers and eight destroyers challenged japanese group of two battleships one cruiser and eleven destroyers that was planning to bomb americas henderson air field the americans were outnumbered and outgunned but the result of the battle was basically draw one disadvantage for the japanese was that their ships guns were loaded with high explosive shells for bombardment rather than armor piecing shells what difference did the japanese using the wrong kind of shell make in the battle
23166 during world war ii the british field several armies that included indians but the most indian of these was the 14th army in which of divisions were predominantly indian of the battalions in this army disproportionate number of them were either gurka nepal or punjab units these were soldiers from the borderlands of modern india or just across the border from it notably absent or at least underrepresented were units from south and central india that is the countrys mainstream why was that did gandhis philosophy of non violence carry greater sway with most indians other than those discussed in the paragraph above
23260 persian empire was older and larger am not sure about this than the roman empire however when it comes to the title of superpower many historians say rome was the world first true superpower why is that
23262 during the soviet occupation of baltic states estonia and latvia saw their countries settled by russians who eventually made up more than of their populations however percentage of russians in lithuania was never more than relatively small number how did lithuania avoid large colonization by the soviet union
23309 it was virtually impossible for citizens of soviet union to move or travel abroad only some ethnic minorities jewish with family members abroad could move out yet with great difficulty why did soviet union impose such strong restrictions on travelling outside its borders was it possible for residents of soviet union to move travel to other communist countries such as china were there any move travel restrictions in western countries in regards to the soviet union
23331 ive been wondering lately do we know where the idea of releasing books that were meant to be read together such as trilogy or longer series came from its my understanding that really old literature was generally stand alone books might be related but it wasnt intended that you read them in any specific order even recently this has been common theres frank baums wizard of oz books for one the chronicles of narnia werent imagined as series and lewis couldnt care less what order you read them in tolkien saw the lord of the rings as one book in three parts not trilogy however these days if books exist in the same world there will be first second third etc almost every time if had to make guess would probably suggest the serialized nature of radio broadcasts as factor does anyone know for certain edit as noted in the answers comments this question was phrased rather poorly my intent was to find where the modern tradition of publishing books in numbered series came from
23359 why did the government of most nations after the fall of rome and the beginning of medieval age turn to monarchy before the fall of rome most nations seem to be organized after different model and few seems to embrace the practice of one person with absolute power the rome had senate and or an emperor the greek some at least had democracy for free men germanic nations had councils or chief that was part of confederations so how did we go from system of so many different government types to monarchy dominating europe
23368 according to what ive read during the warring states period and also later during the three kingdoms period there were armies of the magnitude of few hundred thousands how could they coordinate such an immense mass of people how could they provide the logistics these armies had to be separated into smaller armies suppose then how could the different battalions work together despite the distance
23385 for short story plan to write was wondering how long it would take individuals to travel from the united kingdom to america in
23386 as part of my story letter is sent from england to america in was wondering if there was way to work out how long it would take and perhaps the cost of writing and sending letters
23410 understandably the european nations were embroiled in the napoleonic wars but the american revolutionary war had been over for almost years by then large part of their population too were slave owning plantation owners who were deeply racist and wouldve looked at the haiti slave revolt with great suspicion given the deeply racist nature of the world at that time such that interracial marriage was almost always labelled as coerced regardless of the circumstances why did the white leaders of the usa not intervene in haiti on racial grounds
23445 today nearly all commercial footwear has sole made of either rubber or plastic with rubber like qualities its great material for the job but it comes from tree thats native to the americas and thus was unavailable to the old world before columbus what did they make shoe and boot soles out of in earlier ages ideally it would have to be something relatively tough firm and resistant to wear in contrast to the rest of the shoe which should ideally be relatively soft and flexible
23470 throughout 19th century americans migrated west to settle land and most such trips were on foot and on covered wagons with the arrival of trains the wagons stopped but my guess is that not everyone stopped using the wagons right away since it would be expensive to take all your belongings on train would like to know when people stopped using covered wagons all together did people suddenly stop using wagons as soon as trains arrived and if not how long did it take and what finally persuaded everyone to stop using the wagons also of interest would be to know when the last caravan using covered wagons left for the west
23480 did any contemporary scholars draw connection between the occurrence of the great schism and the crab nebula supernova which both occurred around the middle of already asked at christianity se and got couple of good answers about people who recently made the connection including theory that it may have been invisible around europe because of volcanic eruption in iceland
23510 this article says the case for an automatic association between christianity and monogamy is weakened further by the fact that socially imposed monogamy was first established in ancient greece and rome centuries before christianity even existed greco roman laws prohibited any man from having more than one official wife at time its true that forms of de facto polygamy concubinage sex with slaves continued to be tolerated in these societies nevertheless anti polygamy laws made greco roman society relatively sexually egalitarian scheidel because by preventing elite men from legally acquiring multiple wives they improved the ability of lower ranking men to acquire wives of their own so by the time christianity began spreading through the roman empire in the first centuries ad monogamy was already well established but even though christianity did not introduce socially imposed monogamy to the west it did fully embrace this institution and as noted above it was this embracement that ultimately led to monogamys spread throughout the western world https www psychologytoday com blog darwin eternity why we think monogamy is normal that article says that roman and greek laws prohibited polygamy hundreds of years before christianity want exact dates and exact laws and well exact history on how that happens mean as exact as possible asked this question in political stackexchange https politics stackexchange com questions are democracy strongly linked to monogamy the idea is that monogamy happened due to democracy democracy started in athens at what date then after or before that are there any laws in athens that declare polygamy illegal if so at what date know that polygamy was already illegal in rome and greece far before christianity however want to know exactly when
23554 my understanding is that prior to the migrations invasions of the goths huns and sklavenoi into the balkan peninsula greek and latin where the most common native languages alongside other steadily declining languages such as thracian and illyrian also im aware of the jire ek line which is the theoretical line that divided the balkans into the areas with greek influence from those with latin influence my question is do we know what was the most northern native greek speaking colony in the balkans im assuming such place would be located on the coast of the black sea what about inland balkans also am aware of the status of greek and latin as lingua francas during romes imperial period but im mainly concerned with the use of greek as native language
23557 the house of representatives originally did not pass the 13th amendment and on january it was reconsidered and passed evidently the house first voted that day on whether to reconsider the original vote and then voted on the amendment itself here are the roll calls for the two votes to reconsider the vote by which the house rejected res to pass res the individual votes in the two roll calls are similar mostly differing in predictable ways the curious exception is john ganson who voted nay to reconsidering the amendment but voted yea on the amendment itself why did ganson oppose reconsidering failed vote when he wanted the amendment to pass if there is no evidence to come to conclusion or conjecture in his case what explanations could there be for anyone voting this way schuyler colfax the speaker is absent on the first roll call likely due to custom but did vote on the passing of the amendment which immediately followed the other differences are several members who did not vote in the first roll call but participated in the second

23576 this question is follow up to the question why did poland keep warsaw as its capital instead of returning it to krakow in the 20th century in particular now as for warsaw becoming the capital the court of sigismund iii vasa was moved to warsaw in from the highly interesting reason including the results of alchemical experiment which is unfortunately not matter of this question but it was only short temporal change please write more about these reasons for moving the capital from krakow
23588 are there any known links between the trojan war and the sea people invasions of the late bronze age or any theory linking the two know that the approximate dates for both roughly coincide and that some of the people seem to be the same like the achaeans ekwesh both also involve attacking hittite settlements ilion wilusa do we know if the two are somewhat related or not or is there just not enough archeological evidence to decide
23616 one reason it was so hard for germany to invade russia the soviet union in world war ii and was because the russians had different wider railroad gauge than that of most of the rest of europe making european rolling stock useless on russian railways how did germany resolve that problem in world war ii did it capture enough soviet rolling stock to use on soviet railways did it build trunk lines in the soviet union to stalingrad and other critical points on the european gauge or did it leave this problem mostly unresolved thereby contributing to the german defeat
23640 what was the largest empire in human history in terms of the time required to deliver message from one end of the empire to the other how long was this time

23679 the obvious encyclopedic site surprisingly has nothing on this in its article about denmark in wwii it alludes to british occupation force after the war but is not clear who actually liberated them during the war so who was it british or soviets and where can read more about that particular liberation
23687 medieval literature makes several references to gascon flemish and especially genoese to denote elite troops wielding crossbows however it isnt exactly hard to shoot crossbow accurately and professionalism shouldnt be so hard that you cant train say farmer from york and label them yorkish crossbowmen so what do the labels attached to these soldiers denote exactly superior quality over normal crossbowmen in what attribute
23698 the germans spent large amount of manpower in adverse territory for this city even after long exhausting continuous combat after the war kliest wrote the capture of stalingrad was subsidiary to the main aim it was only of importance as convenient place in the bottleneck between don and the volga where we could block an attack on our flank by russian forces coming from the east at the start stalingrad was no more than name on the map to us yes it is fact that stalingrad was not significantly resourceful to fight for why then did the germans after seeing that it was to be long affair not just encircle the city instead they kept fighting for it in close quarter combat for the citys buildings which is almost always disadvantageous slowing and depleting affair for an invading force considering the momentum of their initial advance could they have fared better by crossing the volga and laying siege to city
23740 wikipedia describes the pelasgians as follows all the indigenous inhabitants of the aegean sea region and their cultures before the advent of the greek language and that these people where seen by ancient writers as populations that either were the ancestors of the greeks or preceded the greeks in greece hold all term for any ancient primitive and presumably indigenous people in the greek world the sea peoples are described as follows the sea peoples were conjectured groups of seafaring raiders usually thought to originate from either western anatolia or southern europe specifically region of the aegean sea furthermore read an interesting analysis about the philistines which suggest that that the philistines sea peoples and pelasgians are all linked somehow dont know much about the bronze age mediterranean so forgive me if ask silly question but im curious to know if these tribes of people are related

23763 for example germans occupied poland then ukraine as part of ussr and this occupation went on for several years did universities keep on working schools how did the curriculum change understand that there was no need to change maths but what about history economics literature were new textbooks written or were those lessons and faculties just abolished maybe someone knows concrete examples of how germans dealt with those issues was it very different in ukraine and france for example maybe germans thought that slavs didnt need schools and colleges at all
23774 documentary on the dark ages says that vikings invaded the british isles after charlemagne of france conquered some of germany and forced the germans to convert or die in the years the germans had religion similar to the norse with wodan odin and an donar thor the vikings invaded lindisfarne island in and set about conquering lot of north west britain do historians accept that the viking age in the uk was instigated by the christian conquest of germany
23812 an interesting conversation has come up on the science fiction and fantasy se site will try to summarize it as briefly as possible someone asked question about the second star wars prequel for those who arent familiar with the movies the gist is as follows group of separatists try to secede from the galactic republic and the jedi try to stop them the jedi are few in number but they have an army of clones to fight for them when the first battle takes place the jedi master yoda says something like begun the clone war has the ensuing conversation was rather interesting someone suggested that no one ever names war after their own country faction alliance or side im not arguing that it is common for country to name war after themselves but suspect that it has happened from time to time obviously the more common approach has been to name wars in one of four ways name it after your opponents the them war this is especially attractive because we like to blame everyone else for our problems and most people dont want to create the impression that they accept responsibility for starting war by naming the war after the other guy you implicitly shift the responsibility onto the shoulders of your enemy examples of this include the french and indian war the iraq war queen annes war the black and tan war aka the war of irish independence etc name it after both sides the us and them war think this is more common in hindsight than at the time of the actual conflict but it happens one way or another examples of this include the spanish american war the franco prussian war the russo japanese war the mexican american war etc in many cases the war is referred to in one way by each side while it is still being fought but afterwards the victors get to determine the official title for example during the mexican american war the mexicans referred to it as the american invasion and americans referred to it as the mexican war after america won we decided to call it the mexican american war by the same token the southern states referred to the american civil war as the war of northern aggression and the union referred to it as the war between the states the war to preserve the union the war of southern secession or the war of rebellion at the time northerners didnt like the idea of calling it civil war but later on tempers cooled and we decided to call it the american civil war despite the desire of some southerners to keep calling it the war of northern aggression name it after the place where it happens or the cause of the conflict the there war the that thing that happened war this is less common in recent history but was fairly common in the past examples of this include the crimean war the american revolutionary war this comes very close to naming war after yourself but im not sure if it is exactly the same the war of the polish succession the war of the spanish succession the french revolution etc name it after how long it lasts the this long war this very rarely happens now but people used to love it for some reason examples of this include the seven years war the hundred years war the thirty years war the seven day war etc there may be few cases in which one side in conflict has named the conflict after themselves either their country their cause or their faction or alliance but am having trouble trying to think of such case the former soviet union refers to world war ii as the great patriotic war and it goes without saying that the great patriots are supposed to be the soviets themselves this is close to what im talking about but it isnt quite the same thing as naming war after yourself it is simply choosing name that makes your side look good and so we come to the point my question is this has anyone ever named war after their own country faction alliance or side note because the victor always gets to write the history books and this frequently includes renaming the war the best way to answer the question is probably to refer to what people called the conflict while it was still in progress thanks to francis davey for reminding me of this one
23840 was violent or nonviolent protest more effective in the context of the 1960s civil rights movement it seems like simple question but on further examination it is challenge to discern the nonviolent work of martin luther king unarguably made significant strides in the civil rights act of but later legislative change may have been caused by the mass rioting after his death so which was more effective at achieving the movements goals such as laws protecting civil rights and the repeal of segregation ordinances similarly either form of protest might be seen as ineffective if it provokes significant backlash such that communities lost more than they gained

23889 kantai kessen the japanese naval strategy for pacific war amounted to simplified the american fleet will cross the pacific to attack japan at that time we will engage and defeat them creating battle plan that depends on the enemys cooperation is beginners mistake not something youd expect from senior naval strategist the japanese must have had some reason to believe that an attack was the only viable option for the americans what was that reason
23916 why was there lack of food during the ww2 in the uk understand the lack of food in the countries occupied by germans as they recruited lot of agricultural products for their war machinery but why there had to be ration books in the non occupied uk which had to feed more or less the same amount of people as before the war what was the mechanism leading to the lack of food there
23983 the romans obviously conquered irelands nearest neighbor britain at least the southern part of it but they seem to have stayed away from ireland at least as far as am aware is this the case and if so why did they abstain from military involvement in ireland when they were already in britain only few miles away
24027 all kamikaze videos ive seen show the plane dive bombing into the deck of ship the photos ive seen also appear to always show burning deck or tower what want to know is did any kamikaze ever impact the side or hull of ship it seems like that would sink the thing much faster also correct me if im wrong but the heavy aa guns appear like they cant point down over the deck they can only point upwards or parallel to the surface but not down at the surface this makes me wonder why kamikazes apparently always go for dive bombing instead of low level run for the broadside edit oldcat explained the situation with carriers but what about other large ships wouldnt their hulls make better targets for sinking than their decks
24031 this question was inspired by another on different se site about the avalon hill board game as told in many american history books the battle of midway featured four japanese heavy carriers vs three americans giving the japanese potentially decisive advantage plus the japanese had many more support ships at least potentially although this advantage was squandered by the japanese wave approach to the battle but in reading this account and others of midway was struck by the fact that while the number of carrier based aircraft was almost equal for the japanese vs for the americans the latter also had landbased aircraft on midway essentially midway was fourth carrier that had more capacity than any of the actual american carriers and three of these carried almost as many aircraft as the four japanese heavy carriers the japanese had two light carriers in the rear waves arriving the second day with total carrying capacity of aircraft enough to reduce but not eliminate the american numerical advantage the importance of the american advantage in landbased aircraft was reflected in the fact that the japanese spent the early part of the battle bombing midway and destroying many of these excess aircraft rather than seeking out and destroying the american carriers perhaps giving the americans decisive head start in this regard years later at the battle of the philippine sea the japanese relied heavily on land based aircraft to counteract americas numerical advantage in carrier based aircraft whether or not the idea is sound the japanese clearly believed in it which may have informed their strategy earlier at midway and elsewhere what do historians have to say about the role of americas landbased aircraft may have played in determining japanese priorities and objectives at midway do they credit the midway based planes with distracting attention from the carriers or even make the case that with fewer planes the japanese ran out faster has anyone pointed out that facsimile of the battle if fought elsewhere without midway and its planes might have turned out very differently
24124 there is long history of free imperial cities having extra privileges within the holy roman empire many cities in contemporary germany switzerland austria and italy were former free imperial cities however most of them disappeared progressively when hitler took power in germany in free cities remained hamburg beck and bremen unsurprisingly hamburg bremen are still free cities to this day which means they are federal nder states within the federal republic of germany what is more mystery is why beck is no longer city state actually the sole reason the city state does not exist anymore and was incorporated into schwestig holstein is because hitler decided it in because of his personal dislike of the city the reason of this dislike is suspected to be because nsdap support was low despite the fact it was obvious that the dissolution of the city state for such reason is completely illegitimate the western allies did not recreate post war city state like they did for hamburg and bremen is there any reasons the western allies restored of the free cities but not the third is there any political group in beck that are striving in order to restore their status as an independent federal state it doesnt seem to be the case but id just ask in case might have missed something or used the wrong keywords in german im excluding berlin as it has completely separate history which is out of topic here
24162 in the korean war china sent in about million troops fairly quickly and actually fought the american and un forces in the vietnam war 1950s the only chinese assistance could find was few thousand troops sent to do repair work on military bases they did not fight the south vietnamese or americans edit have since learned that the chinese actually sent over one hundred thousand troops into vietnam it appears they did fight the americans in an anti aircraft role from the ground nevertheless this does not seem anywhere near equivalent to the ground war in korea where their goal was presumably to reunite the korean peninsula why did china support the one but not the other they were both neighboring states of china there are also two facts about the korean war that find critical the us had the atomic bomb in the 50s but china intervened anyway mao zedong was in power with healthy cult of personality and could have ordered just about any war he wanted at least with nearby country these two facts remained the same in the vietnam war so why did china not assist north vietnam in similar scale as they did in korea did they perhaps know the us could never win in such quagmire and thus didnt have much to worry about
24185 am telling my daughter nighttime stories mostly from history and recently talked about athens and sparta in my tales athenian turned out to be well rounded people great at many things ranging from arts philosophy and sciences to physical fitness and war spartans on the other hand turned out to be vicious bullies and murderers slightly better than athenians at war but completely inept in anything cultural and then thought that perhaps was unfair in that cartoonish depiction of spartans were they really mindless bullies and nothing else after all they were quite good in speaking succinctly and vividly perhaps they did create something great that im not aware of thus the question what did spartans leave to posterity if anything other than legends of their military aptitude and laconic speeches
24203 in recent history many dictatorships have been elected with unbelievable results for example al sisi in egypt with of the votes or abd al rab mansur al hadi in yemen with would like to know whether government president has ever been elected with of the votes it doesnt matter whether the state is recognized or de facto exists it doesnt need to be proven that the elections were rigged either although information about this is welcome am looking for elections for the head government or parliament of an independent state though so not small political entities within countries where say all inhabitants voted for the same guy
24210 https en wikipedia org wiki mongol invasion of rus the campaign was heralded by the battle of the kalka river in which resulted in mongol victory over the forces of several rus principalities the mongols nevertheless retreated full scale invasion of rus by batu khan followed from to the invasion was ended by the mongol succession process upon the death of gedei khan all russian states were forced to submit to mongol rule and became part of the golden horde empire some of which lasted until mongol invaders of russia enjoyed level of success never experienced by the europeans why is that
24253 read here and there about sieges of fortified castles which lasted extended lengths of time two years for instance was there any castle in medieval europe that was self sustaining by self sustaining mean it could produce enough food to feed its defender the ability to grow crops and raise cattle within the fortifications in amounts which would allow people inside to survive understand that those sieges could last so long because of amassed reserves of food was wondering though did anybody tried to be to certain extent independent from anything outside the walls note believe that this would also be limited by some everyday items like wood for instance which are slow growing and thus one needs large reservoir to account for natural replacement
25317 in the trench warfare of the first world war the mud was often knee deep although it sometimes reached well above the soldiers chests these conditions were obviously horrendous and made it almost impossible to fight effectively know that several combatant nations issued jackboots boots that slip on and dont have laces to their infantry most notably the germans although it would have been difficult for anyone to keep their boots on in the thick deep sucking mud imagine that it would be even worse for troops wearing jackboots which arent quite as snug as laced boots how did soldiers who wore jackboots avoid losing their foot gear in the mud
25319 just read this it says on august the soviet union launched the invasion of manchuria massive military operation mobilizing million soldiers against one million kwantung army troops the last remaining japanese military presence soviet forces won decisive victory while the kwantung suffered massive casualties with having surrendered bolded that last part but note there is no citation for it could it be incorrect in the pacific theater where americans were fighting the japanese there were very few japanese surrenderers such was their reputation fighting almost to the last man so why did out of million japanese surrender in manchuria just to be clear manchuria was an industrial center that supplied massive amounts of material to japan such as iron and coal this seems thundering motherload more important than say small remote island like iwo jima no offense to anyone there it just seems to me like the japanese gave up hugely strategic region so easily why did they do this
25320 are there any sources that would tell us whether any ancient greeks or romans were afraid of spiders
25343 what happened in america seems to be nothing of the kind that happened in france few years later american independence was all about group of englishmen exercising their rights under the bill of rights no taxation without representation had been dominant theme in the british parliament since charles in the thirteen colonies there were no immediate changes in state laws and society after independence the american president effectively became an elected king slavery continued etc society continued much as it had done before but without the colonial power being involved in france there was indeed revolution society was turned on its head the king eventually lost his slaves including in the french dominions were freed popular assembly was set up etc my guess is that the term american revolution was not used until much later certainly not until after the events in france after which the two became spuriously linked so who and when did they coin the term american revolution

25366 if we take look at country designations with depressing regularity the most repressive ones call themselves democratic peoples republic of korea north korea democratic republic of the congo german democratic republic democratic kampuchea if you look at the human development index the last entries always begin officially with republic of there are also exceptions republic of botswana or federal republic of germany have good record while there are also autocratic kingdoms like saudi arabia in contrast to parliamentary ones united kingdom netherlands denmark is this relatively new phenomenon in the wake of ideologies which promised to build better system after the demise of feudalism and the outgrowth of the industrial revolution or are there precedents in history we often do not learn the full designation of countries or state like entities
25373 up until the rise of the roman republic the greek phalanx was considered the dominant form of military tactics evolution had simply favoured longer and longer spears by the time of alexander phalanxes often carried polearms that rivalled pike in length the kings of rome appeared to have gone with this prevailing trend by the time of the early republic however things had changed although not the well organised legionnaires of popular imagination the hastatii principes and triarii of this era tended to favour stabbings swords over spears this was the army that was able to secure the basis of the roman empire including defeat of macedonia and other states belonging to alexanders successors which presumably were still putting pike phalanxes in the field one thing that has never been clear to me is how and why this new military model developed and whether it was instrumental in defeating romes enemies so why did roman soldiers start to favour swords and maniples over the traditional spear phalanx was this new method of waging war significant factor in their success or was it more case of other factors such as good discipline and organisation compared with the relatively chaotic and fragmented post alexander world if so why did the sword armed roman armies enjoy such an advantage over the phalanx

25481 pre roman sites in britain get lumped together as ancient but in reality they span good couple of thousand years between the neolithic and the iron age that made me wonder whether there was any evidence to support the assumption that things like stone circles megalithic burial chambers hill forts and the like existed in similar cultural continuity to put it another way is there any evidence that iron age people were still raising or using similar circles and burial moments to their neolithic counterparts or that anything like hill forts roundhouses and stone dykes were being built in the late stone age

25906 am currently reading william shirers the rise and fall of the third reich find it an interesting take on nazi germany particularly with its emphasis on the viewpoints afforded by the foreign office and other papers captured by the allies on the other hand there are some parts which bug me slightly such as shirers evident dislike for ribbentrop among other characters which feels like it does lead him to dismiss him as serious character from time to time in addition im aware that it is over fifty years old and not very removed from the time it is relating dont think this is reason to throw the book out with the bathwater but do want to ask what to watch out for are there specific or general points in which the historical consensus has moved away from shirers presentation are there specific aspects of the narration which have been directly challenged in the intervening years more generally is there anything to watch out for while reading it
25916 ww1 broke out after series of ultimatums and warnings against each other however understand that every power claimed that the other powers were acting against its interests and it was participating in the war only for self defense can understand these claims from the points of view of austria hungary russia and even france britain participated protesting against the violation of neutrality of belgium so even that claim is clear at least its not false though it might have been just an excuse however how could germany make this claim as it had given ultimatum to russia against its military mobilization how did germany convince itself or its population that this war was only for self defense

25921 we all know that the iberian peninsula is separated between two major countries spain and portugal when and how was the country now known as portugal formed portuguese is very similar to the galician language in northwestern spain and not that much far from the official castilian castellano as speak bit and could understand few words of portuguese according to wikipedia portugal was part of the roman empire and mostly divided in two roman provinces galicia and lusitania which were then invaded by germanic tribes and later by the muslims the article states that during the 9th century the county of portugal was created did it have at that time the same language in the iberian peninsula there are many languages castilian galician catalan and portuguese just to note some of them mean if the people felt they are portuguese how could they accept kings with asturian origins my question is when exactly did portugal became an independent country with its current language my focus is was 9th century portugal created by an asturian king and was the dominant language there portuguese
26014 king henry viii executed two of his wives for alleged adultery this was almost certainly true of one of them catherine howard while the facts concerning the other one anne boleyn are in dispute when king christian viii of denmark married princess caroline of great britain as detailed in the movie royal affair the queens affair with the court doctor and royal adviser struensee led to the mans overthrow and execution in third situation isabella the wife of king edward ii had an affair with mortimer that resulted in the overthrow and probable murder of the king by his wife and lover as commenter pointed out queens adultery would likely threaten the succession with potentially serious consequences for the country are there any well known cases in history where it was established that queen consort of king slept with someone other than her husband and no one was executed or was known to get into serious trouble as result if so what were the circumstances that prevented bad consequences put another way why might the threat to the succession or to the country not seem to matter in such cases queen consort is the wife of king queen victoria who allegedly had some affairs after prince albert died is not in this category elizabeth was known as the virgin queen

26180 during wwii level of clearance called bigot was adopted by the allies this was to my understanding done in order to create smaller circle of individuals who were cleared to know information than the previous highest clearance level the planning of operations neptune and overlord have two questions which the mods might decide to break up where did the name bigot come from the other clearance levels seem rather appropriately named confidential secret top secret etc is their an etymological reason for using bigot was the name picked out of code book are there any other clearance levels that have been created used outside of the standard when say standard am referring to any clearance level that is regularly used or was created for regular use

26426 after doing my own research found that the apple pie was invented in england in the 1300s with that being the case why do we often hear the saying its as american as the apple pie because had always thought the saying came from america inventing very tasty desert but apparently america didnt even invent it why do americans claim it is there something am missing

26498 anti semites hate jews however found it strange that they call their hatred anti semitism didnt they know that arabs are semites too hitler seem to think that some race were destroying civilization many would disagree but that was his opinion one such race is the jews some say that hitler hated jews even more than blacks hitler thought that blacks are civilization helping while jews or semites are civilization destroying or so heard yet hitler was friendly toward arab that are semites too why some would say that semites in hitler eyes only means jews found this bit strange mean the whole german didnt know that arab are semites too what obviously racism like any ideology and religion is ridiculous in general however they must have some sort of explanation to justify this ridiculousness
26506 according to wikipedia the mayflower began its voyage in july of was delayed while waiting for the speedwell and then ultimately left for america in september this put them in america at the beginning of november and left the pilgrims very vulnerable to the winter conditions in america without adequate shelter and supplies understand that the delay caused by the speedwell could not have been foreseen but even counting that why plan to leave mid late summer and not in the spring so that they would arrive under better conditions

26650 edessa was ruled by thoros who was officially vassal of the turks but in reality acted independently he did not expect that situation to continue for very much longer without help so he offered to adopt baldwin as his successor shortly thereafter coup topped thoros leaving baldwin as the sole ruler of edessa the new county of edessa was the first of the crusader states concise history of the crusades madden wikipedia suggests the title was related to the county of verdun baldwin succeeded thoros as ruler taking the title of count having been count of verdun as vassal of his brother in europe couldnt find reference to baldwin ever being count of verdun see his brother godfrey of bouillon as one the counts of verdun belongs to the family of ardennes of which godfrey of bouillon the hero of the first crusade was an illustrious member catholic encyclopedia volume tournon zwirner so godfrey was the count of verdun made his brother vassal and gave him the title later count baldwin conquers city and decides to make new county out of it because thats the same level of title he had before was it considered too brazen to claim higher title

26660 have there ever been recorded battles in the middle ages which ended badly for all parties would like to explain what could be meant by disaster giving to possible scenarios by disaster dont mean there was no winner during or after the battle in means of fighting the disaster could be that even if one party won the battle neither of the involved parties could profit from that due to some circumstances like new political military alliances or something else also for example even if one of two parties won the battle both the kings rulers leaders died during the battle and their former countries or properties fall into disastrous war because of claims of inheritance or kind of civil war or revolt against the leaders started during the fight so disaster or bad ending could be short middle term result which wasnt in favour of neither of the involved parties an example which dont meet all my conditions know was the battle of alcacer quibir three kings died but the battle didnt end up that bad for one party as they could hide the death of the king and the succession was could have been cleared without big trouble as it seems this is explicitly an list question so feel free to provide list answers
26675 at the beginning of the civil war both sides were very confident in quick and easy victory can see why the north would think so they had better trained army better infrastructure including many more miles of railroad and superior industry why were the southerners so confident they would win is it because the capital washington was so close to the front lines
26695 the standard idea said of feudalism is that nobles have vassals which could have vassals of their own so that noble might have an extra title lying around and grant it to someone in exchange for fealty but dont think ive ever heard of an english duke having sub vassal who was an earl im assuming that elsewhere on the continent it probably happened figure the duke of normandy must have had counts as vassals if this is true that english duke didnt do it is this just due to english custom or law or just realities on the ground maybe english dukes didnt govern such ungainly territories that passing out titles for loyalty made sense or maybe dukes were just weird in england to begin with because gather they were late import from the continent and for most of the middle ages england just had earls
26699 one incentive for wealthy romans to finance construction of aqueducts was of course glory ones name would go up on the wall somewhere and down in history too however there was more to aqueducts than just delivering water to cities for drinking washing cooking and lavatory needs for instance hydraulic mining was all the rage in some places one would run spur from the existing aqueduct to indulge in bit of ruina mortium or hushing to use water to bare up gold or nickel vein perhaps prospector looking for funds might approach me offering contract and promising sizable cut or could hire someone to do some research to see if there were any areas that had growth potential and the one obstacle was the lack of water or perhaps the governor or the emperor himself might send his agents to me and would promise for fee to provide engineers foremen and slaves for an aqueduct project in other words were there wealthy people in the empire not personally involved in aqueduct construction who could invest in it on the chance they might turn profit
26713 suppose youre landowner in germania just west of the rhine it is the 2nd century you own number of farms couple of good houses maybe some slaves some of whom are on the verge of buying themselves out youve just paid your taxes the publican whose duty it is to collect taxes in your area sends his agents to you demanding you pay again something has gone wrong somewhere the publicans office is short of the expected budget its shakedown pure and simple you tell the agents theyre mistaken they tell you they dont care and youd better pay up right now dozen cutthroats show up armed to the teeth to back up the agents claim youve got no choice you pay the following week the agents show up again accompanied by two dozen cutthroats this time and simply tell you that you have to vacate the premises now your land with everything on it belongs to the publican effective immediately you tell them the land has been in your family for three generations they call you liar you ask them to give you an hour they agree you take bath put on your best toga and rush to the magistrate you explain the situation to him the magistrate says can you prove it prove what prove that they made you pay twice and that theyre illegally expropriating your estate what kind of proof would you have to present documents plaque would you have to produce witnesses who could confirm that the land is rightfully yours would there be record in the quaestors office over in rome would you as the owner have copy of that record signed by whom if signatures were important whod be called upon to verify them what kind of specialist
26736 what remember from my college course is that whenever delegation of barons came to discuss their grievances in english the king would hear them out politely without understanding word conclude the meeting by saying jaccept and leave it at that this went on for quite some time after the conquest john lackland must have spoken pretty good english he negotiated with the provincial barons expertly his own brothers nickname however was french ur de lion their father henri ii thought of himself as the king of both england and france at times who was the first king of england to speak english as first language and what brought about this change in the ruling houses philosophy
26756 wikipedia defines an empire as following the term empire does not have precise definition but is generally applied to political entities that are considered to be especially large by the standards of their time and that have acquired significant part of their territory by conquest when one thinks of an empire large state comes to mind which comprises of multiple cultures ethnicities and formidable military but then when one looks at the aztec empire it all goes wrong compared to contemporary and historical empires one could say that aztec empire was not even large enough to be duchy in europe or emirate in asia also neither was it singular political entity in traditional concept of empires but the counter argument here would be the holy roman empire it comprised of only sq mi of area asked few friends about it but they disregard the area based on claims that aztecs had no horses which were backbone of communications and expansion in that era my question is why are they referred to as the aztec empire why not use more modest and realistic titles of confederation or kingdom
26802 in his book tigers in the mud otto carius talks about his experiences in the western front mostly spent inside the ruhr pocket with great disdain some quotes we were used to an opponent the stature of the russians we were amazed at the contrast during the war have never saw soldiers disperse head over heels even though virtually nothing was happening tigers in the mud p214 five russians were more dangerous than thirty americans we already noticed that in our few days in the western front p210 again the pace of the war surprised me the russians would never have let us have so much time the americans took so long to close the pocket especially given that nobody around wanted to fight anymore well organized german corps could have closed the pocket in week there are other disparaging remarks on the effectiveness of the american troops as well in addition to sarcastic quotations of how fearful the american troops were my question is is this assessment fair was ottos experience of americans due to the fact that the units around the ruhr pocket did not expect much resistance due to the aforementioned nobody was fighting anymore and so was very casual with their pace and were of lower quality as bradley sent his crack units to race to the elbe and austria

26838 came across holocaust denier who claims that there is plaque outside auschwitz which says that the nazis murdered million people there mostly jewish however the plaque used to say million in the 1940s then it was changed several times over the years citing lower and lower number of deaths the man was talking to claimed that the number of million jewish deaths in the holocaust is fake because the million figure has remained the same in the face of these substantial plaque changes from million to less than million have looked online and found that this is popular argument among holocaust deniers but was able to find source debunking this what would be the rebuttal to this argument
26912 much later west virginia broke off from virginia as result of the civil war earlier than that maine became independent from massachusetts as part of the missouri compromise but during and after the revolution virginia claimed kentucky as its backland in it relinquished this claim to let kentucky split off to become the 15th state vermont had just done that from new york to become the 14th why was that apparently there was pressure from the other states was it because they wanted all the states to be about the same size in area and population or because they wanted to prevent an arms race of superstates like virginia kentucky north carolina tennessee pennsylvania ohio in todays terms etc
26916 why was the confederate president jefferson davis or any other confederate soldier not tried for high treason
26926 one of the reasons often used to justify the use of nuclear weapons is that the alternative strategy firebombing and invasion of japan would have caused much more death and destruction for both americans and the japanese but wonder why was an invasion the necessary alternative as understand japan was running low on resources such as oil rubber and steel even from the beginning of the war if the invasion of the homeland looked so costly for both sides why was it deemed necessary im not aware of any allies japan could have counted on to supply it why not maintain blockade and wait them out it seems that that would have cost less in terms of american casualties
26930 accounts of the build up to the american civil war put lot of weight on the concept of balance between the number of free states and slave states in the union and various complicated wrangling that was necessary to preserve parity between them deciding whether newly organized states would be admitted as slave states or admitted as free states if understand correctly whether slavery was allowed in particular state was not up to the state legislature but decided centrally by congress this was somehow tied to wish to maintain strict balance between proponents and opponents of slavery in the federal senate apparently there seems to have been an assumption that senator elected in state where congress had allowed slavery would must be proponent of slavery and senator elected in state where congress had forbidden it would must oppose it was there any mechanism to ensure that each senators views matched the particular rules that congress had decided on for the state they represented it seems to me that the idea that the federal institutions rather than states themselves decided where slavery would be legal would have been illusory as long as congress was in complete balance if say the population of free state wanted to become slave state or vice versa all they had to do would be to elect one senator who supported the new status and there would then be majority in the senate for changing the slave free assignment of the state anyway so why did politicians care when admitting new state whether initially to classify it as slave state or free state if the population of that new state would in practical terms have the power to undo that decision anyway
26945 in the korean war from to lot of countries including the the france canada australia and even colombia the philippines and ethiopia participated in the war under the resolution however those countries didnt participate in the vietnam war the two wars seem to have similar characteristics war caused by fought for an ideology proxy war between the and the former ussr was there any particular reason that the couldnt get necessary supports from its allies such as the and france for the vietnam war france colonized indochina and controlled it until they vietnam laos and cambodia became independent after the first indochina war france helped the in various wars including the american revolutionary war but didnt in the vietnam war was there any particular reason

26978 am well aware that the german invasion of the soviet union as depicted on maps like these showed large german gains in and subsequently on the road to stalingrad in my understanding however was that these gains were mainly in the baltic states belorussia and the ukraine and that only little of russia proper as we might define it today was occupied by the germans except for the seesaw fighting on the road to moscow from october to say march during which almost square miles of the country was captured and liberated similar exception can be made for land between the don and volga rivers in late that the germans occupied for few months before losing the battle of stalingrad if anything russia gained troops civilians and factories that were withdrawn from the non russian part of the soviet union in anticipation of german occupation to compensate for lost territory how much of russia of was occupied by the germans at its maximum extent in december and or and after the successful conclusion of the russian winter counteroffensives please use germanys march recapture of kharkov as the end of the russian counteroffensive my problem is that am not sure how to define russia want the predecessor to todays russia post war changes probably mean that they are not exactly the same my best guess is that the best proxy for russia is the russian federalist soviet republic assuming it is in fact the best predecessor put another way the question is how much of german occupied territory was russia however defined as opposed to the rest of the soviet union
26981 remembering the scene where the boat meets the destroyer during the hunt in das boot destroyers have low gauge 5m and are very top heavy all those guns and waterbombs over the waterline with high wind resistance and only small lean body below to achieve speed how were they able to operate under storm conditions normally would expect that the destroyer tumbles and wobbles like drunkard on ice barely managing to ride out the storm that they were still able to spot and hunt boats seems like small miracle did they had stabilizers or how did they manage it were there losses when destroyers encountered bad weather and finally capsized or even turtled hope that is the right word background have now read the described scene in the book again the author lothar nter buchheim was really on the boat as observer in the book the destroyer was met when the wind was beaufort fresh breeze and sea state was moderate wave height it was raining with an overcast sky so no stormy conditions still the captain decided to attack the destroyer the author mentioned that he thought the captain is crazy because destroyers are very hard to hit low gauge high maneuverability changes course too often and they have already been spotted the destroyer was yd away coming from the left when the destroyer captain charged with flank speed
26991 the portuguese were the first europeans to go around the cape of good hope and build several outposts later turned into large colonies at angola and mo ambique on both sides of the cape but none on the cape itself as far as know cannot see the sense in that for guess that control of the cape was essential to keep their own routes open for traffic with india in fact that was one of the reasons why the british conquered the dutch cape colony guess that powerful enemy navy at the cape could seriously hinder portuguese movements something that dont know if actually happened at the time of the portuguese dutch wars so the question is did the portuguese build any settlement around the cape and if not why
27023 official historiography says that great wall of china is built across the historical northern borders of china to protect the chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the eurasian steppe wikipedia eurasian steppe is located north from chinese states so the fortifications supposed to face north toward the place where possible invaders may come from however looking at pictures of great wall notice many places where the fortifications rather look like bi directional the parapet seems to be convenient to aid defense from both directions to north and to south merely equally heres what mean left unidirectional the parapet is built for defense on one side right bidirectional the parapet is built for deference to both sides can shoot arrows from parapet slits in both directions it is not only about walls itself some towers also look like they are built to assist fire in both directions question is there decent explanation of this phenomenon disclaimer im not military expert so answers like your question comes from false premise because are also greatly appreciated
27054 it is well known fact that many people from the soviet bloc fled to the west to escape communism and that during the entire soviet time frame from the beginning of the russian civil war in until the last years of communism in while its true communism was terrible thing capitalism wasnt exactly free of problems either and because of intense soviet propaganda it could be tempting for low class workers and or unemployed people to flee to the soviet bloc in order to have guaranteed job especially after the death of stalin when the situation of the soviet block was much improved did people flee in this direction too people that would not count are people spying for any western government people who originate from soviet block country returning back home people moving there temporary for any non politically motivated reason scientific research humanitarian etc if they do so permanently then it counts as we cannot know if there was political reason behind that or not
27091 as you can see from this bbc documentary the crew of this summertime journey from denmark to ireland in viking longship suffered from hypothermia approx into the video even though they were wearing modern foul weather gear and clothing like all experienced sailors im sure the vikings picked their weather windows carefully nonetheless conditions around the north sea are unpredictable and at times extreme most historically accurate illustrations of viking garb show woolen hats tunic like shirts pants and leather shoes good for cool damp weather but not enough for soaking wind driven rain and sea spray did they have heavy weather gear did they use fires or some type of fabric shelter while onboard do we have any record of what vikings wore for these conditions in other words other than making educated guesses do we have any knowledge of how vikings adapted to cold wet windy conditions at sea
27159 remember reading story once about plan to build seaport and modify significant amount of the coastline at once by using nuclear explosion cant find anything about it now when try googling does anybody know what am referring to and how can find more information about it what do remember it was an arctic community in canada either in the yukon or the it was early on in the development of nuclear technology so maybe around the 1960s and it was ultimately cancelled when they realized that radiation would be significant and long lasting consequence did read the article online originally
27163 many european and east asian powers had very large sailing ships clippers junks and the like polynesians had sailing capacity although theirs ships werent as large why didnt native americans build large ships like that in my west coast experience they were limited to canoes and the like
27211 when people think of the nazi salute the hand is generally out in front around palm down sometimes it would be lower which think reinforces that its palm open and down gesture here we see many civilians taking less disciplined more upright approach but everyone except hitler still has their palm down or at least forward so why did hitler salute with his palm clearly upwards think it makes him look aloof and undisciplined very different from propaganda photos if he wanted to be seen as this why did he salute like this
27263 ive been reading the diary of young girl by anne frank prior to reading it always assumed that her story was somewhat typical of jews living in countries that germany occupied or even in occupied holland during world war but im finding few signs that things seem bit unusual first of all it seems that the franks must have had large supply of cash to be able to afford the food and other supplies during their time of hiding secondly they were hidden within the boundaries of city in warehouse office complex how typical were those conditions compared to other jews living in the same area in hiding know there were others in hiding but im just trying to gauge how typical their situation was it seems to me that they were actually fairly fortunate compared to others in their circumstances excepting of course how the story ends and im wanting to get further opinion as to how true that might be
27269 what did the romans call black people sub saharan in classic latin as well as vulgar latin and slang
27358 the turks used to write their language using the arabic alphabet after wwi when mustafa kemal revolutionized the country he imposed the usage of latin alphabet also the new writing system seems to have been particularly inspired from german rather than any other language using the latin alphabet why is that understand mustafa kemal needed to revolutionize westernize and modernize the country however nobody else in the region used the latin alphabet and do not see how making of the population suddenly illiterate as well as making old books completely unreadable was supposed to help modernize the country also why inspire the writing from german specifically right after the wwi alliance with germany failed
27364 for long time the south pole was one of the last great targets of explorers on earth there were number of expeditions to explore the region but for some reason everyone who tried to reach the pole did so from the ross sea towards new zealand rather than from the weddell sea towards the south atlantic why did all the south pole attempts use the ross sea instead of the weddell
27382 in the great gatsby in chapter fitzgerald writes that nick visited meyer wolfsheim and that he was in an office with door marked swastika holding company the great gatsby was written between and looked online and found that when hitler was put in charge of his partys propaganda machine in he chose the swastika specifically because he felt that it was aryan and anti semitic im interested to know the following was the swastika symbol that would have been used by jewish business owner in or the approximate time of the novel would reader in have associated this symbol with the national socialist party or was the party still relatively unknown such that its main symbol would not have been known to people until later
27401 what wouldve happened if person in nazi germany sued doctors or the state for murder of their disabled relatives also were people allowed to view public records in nazi germany were records reliable was there fraud
27414 had conversation with an individual recently about how unusual it was that there were so few individuals who appeared to be native american in north america today say appear since no doubt many people have at least small percentage of native american dna if their families are not recent immigrants anyway part of the conversation went into european colonization and how many native americans there were relative to europeans during the colonization and manifest destiny time periods this individual claimed that the north americas were not heavily populated relative to standards of europe at that time and therefore the european settlers made up more significant percentage of north americas population then would have presumed im wondering how accurate this claim was can anyone give me an idea of the actual density and general population of north america immediately prior to colonization as well as what these numbers looked like after the first major deaths from diseases like smallpox and gonorrhoea id also be curious about how those numbers compared to number of colonists sent from europe but thats harder number to define and articulate since it happened over long length of time its not as important to me as simply understanding the population density of the americas and how that compared to that of europe
27416 the germans had some of the best machine guns and tanks during world war ii likewise the americans had big advantage with the m1 garand which patton famously called the greatest battle implement ever devised my question is did the soviets similarly have an area of military equipment that was far superior to that of other nations for example were their mortars or aircraft better than those of germany america britain etc my question isnt just comparison of soviet and german equipment but comparison between all major nations involved in wwii it wouldnt count if soviet mortars were better than germans but worse than americans for example
27519 antarctica was the last continent to be discovered and the first confirmed landfall was on january however most discussions of early world maps seem to peter out well before that such as this wikipedia article which only goes up to the situation is muddied even more by the fact that antarctica known then as terra australis appeared on many world maps before it was even discovered such as this map however this is based on arguments from legends and various erroneous information rather than on any actual evidence surely after humanity first set foot on the last continent it wasnt long before they started mapping the real shape of it when was the first map produced based on this real information regardless of whether it was actually accurate in the era before we had artificial satellite technology etc this question is made even more important by the fact that world map incorporating this shape would be largely complete although world maps would arguably not really be complete in terms of approximate landmass shapes until the first whole maps of severnaya zemlya were completed in
27583 ive been trying to figure this out for while and its really bugging me seeing robert kennedy if im right in the background there made me really curious about everyone else around lyndon johnson the guy kennedy is talking to could be martin luther king jr but thats as far as ive gotten no convenient wikipedia article about this photo to help me this time can anyone identify the people in the photo

27619 what trains were used on the dakar niger railway in the late 1950s and early 1960s the transition to independence are there any images available can find images of the railway from and im guessing the locomotives that are in the first link were used throughout the 1950s or are at least representative given that they were apparently built in with similar set in but id love to be able to confirm this guess
27641 after the second world war and after the full impact of what the nazis had done became clear it seems like international politics moved to the left in the east and far east support for communist movements rapidly rose in the west socialist labour and trade unionist parties saw sudden surge in support the largest swing in uk electoral history for example was to the labour party in the general election the us doesnt seem to have experienced this instead if anything it lurched to the right the nazis are and were demonised as much in the us as in any of the other 2nd world war allies why didnt they experience the same political shift away from that direction as most other involved countries did
27644 have been listening to podcast called the history of byzantium and in one of the episodes there was discussion about the lack of reference to mohammad or quran in the century after his death and muslims were referred as ishmailets saracens etc but never any reference to the prophet it sounded like the caliphate from damascus somehow created an image of mohammad after that period an islam that is more similar to our days version emerges with references to its prophet and the holy text havent been able to find any sources on this discussion what have been able to find is link to this book which havent read yet http www amazon com did muhammad exist inquiry obscure dp 161017061x can someone give modern historic outlook of beginnings of islam and the existence of its prophet also please correct if there are any mistakes in this text
27670 some years ago was told by some taiwanese friends that nationalist troops who had surrendered to the communists during or after the chinese civil war were made to fight for the communists rather than demobilized as the story goes when the korean war started these troops were sent to fight in korea as way of reducing their numbers is there any truth to this story
27767 from my earliest memory ive always thought that older americans thought reagan was great president recently ive seen lot of people compare trump who establishment republicans detest to reagan and even state that when reagan began he was the outsider is this true about reagan when he first ran in was he out of favor by the establishment and viewed as the outsider
27769 realize this question can be quite controversial since positive identification is rather subjective especially with regards to ancient history regardless am curious to know which ancient rulers historians are fairly confident we can identify remains for my first guess would be one of the early egyptian pharaohs perhaps narmer
27790 in the movie gallipoli the anzacs were depicted charging into machine gun fire knowingly without any sort of protection in other words it was like shooting fish in barrel if they knew that there would be such heavy fire as previous unsuccessful waves have demonstrated why did they continue to send what were essentially suicide waves am no expert in warfare but it seems reasonably logical to at least have the soldiers charge in with some kind of protection in the form of say armoured plates on wheels envisaged simple shaped unit with walls made of thick metal where men push from inside the shape in order to slowly advance safely towards enemy lines
27806 in film bitwa warszawska which tells the story of the polish bolshevik war there is scene with two cryptographers that are able to break the cipher used by red army turns out it was simple caesar cipher and the only problem was that bolsheviks used transliteration to latin alphabet instead of cyrillic if understand the scene correctly myself find it rather hard to believe that major european army in the twentieth century used such simple and easy to break cipher failed however to find any sources that would either confirm or deny that so what do we know about the cryptographical methods used by soviet union in that time
27807 in the modern age it is normal that groups of countries require passports and possibly visas for visitors from other groups of countries in the past many people from europe migrated to north america and other parts of the world according to wikipedia on the history of passports in the later part of the nineteenth century and up to world war passports were not required on the whole for travel within europe and crossing border was relatively straightforward procedure it continues to describe how during world war european governments introduced border passport requirements for security reasons and to control the emigration of people with useful skills sounds like an exit visa when did government authorities start to enforce generic limitations on who could settle in the area under their control and when did they start to enforce such limitations on who could travel for either business or leisure purposes was world war the first time either of those were enforced for example were there limitations either way on transatlantic travellers in the 19th century whether for temporary visit or for permanent settlement by generic limitations mean limitations that apply by default to everybody such as requirement to have passport with visa to travel or work permit or other kind of visa to settle do not mean specific rulings such as exile that are targeted at particular individuals

27899 suppose found two different settlements named and these settlements are located near the river the distance between and is so that it would take at least months of continuous travel to go from to what are the things need to look at to prove that the two settlements belongs to the same civilization say if nuclear dating establishes that the two settlements existed around the same time range given by nuclear dating merge were separated by some time years obviously least count of nuclear dating technique kindly answer it in very general sense so can understand the basic underlying assumptions edit okay now much specific question how can we say that mohan jo daro harappa and kalibangan belong to same category mean what is the evidence to support this claim
27923 in the german navy both the kaiserliche marine and kriegsmarine the two ship names of scharnhorst and gneisenau were used together for sister ships for example the sms scharnhorst and gneisenau were sister armoured cruisers in wwi and the germans also planned the names ersatz sharnhorst and gneisenau for two never built battlecruisers the names also reappeared together in the scharnhorst class battleships of the kriegsmarine in wwii why did the germans keep on pairing these two ship names together note do know that the namesake for these two ships were prussian generals in the napoleonic wars but why were the names used together on sister ships instead of other names of generals of the same era like bl cher
27959 its interesting that people from long ago were often only known for their only name such as socrates jesus and constantine but in our current society almost everyone has first name and last name with some having middle name im curious what culture first brought forth the concept of last names ive heard that last names were used to identify people who worked specific positions in society like the last names carpenter and smith but what about many other last names which bear no resemblance to jobs that may have been held by people examples last names like parker was it person that parked carriages cars
28050 was wondering which year in history was the bloodiest is it one of the last two years of wwii or are there any other such bloody time in history only wish to include non natural deaths such as from war disease or even from accidents the number alone is not helpful so am looking for ratio of total number of such deaths to the total human population of given year
28089 romania is located between bulgaria serbia on one side and ukraine many slavic countries on the other romanian is however romance latin language and not slavic they dont use the cyrillic alphabet my impression is also that romanian culture is more latin than that of some other countries in the region romanians are mostly othodox christians though why is romania more latin than its neigbors north and south
28152 this question was prompted by another one long time ago before well documented my internet research looked into the history of titanium its procurement refinement and work ability cannot remember any sources beyond few wikipedia articles that have since changed significantly was fascinated by this metal for several reasons it was only available in the soviet union and manchuria during most of the cold war its very useful metal with very high melting temperature and tensile strength and strangest of all titanium dioxide exists almost everywhere in the ground yet in the 1960s the usa had to secretly purchase titanium from the ussr to build its super spyplane the and sr blackbird so whats the deal with titanium when was tio2 refinement process invented that let us not be dependent on ilmenite fetio3 when were major sources of titanium found and exploited outside of the soviet union and china ultimately what im asking is when and how did the west lose its dependency on the ussr for titanium edit if recall my research correctly something changed in the early 1990s think some new refinement process does anyone know
28158 did most citizens in the ussr have bank accounts how did they work plain checking accounts or was credit allowed were banks open days week like non religious government is supposed to was there monthly fee for owning an account did they ever get around to using atms
28233 it is widely assumed that the carthaginian general hannibal barca crossed the western alps some years ago with an army of men horses and elephants in direction of italy and the roman republic but sadly we have not found many evidence of that event and thus dont even know the exact route what we also know is that hannibals elephants died during that route it was more than elephants and also we know that elephants are not really typical fauna of the alps that leads me to the question how is it possible that we never found any elephant fossils in the western alps yet is it possible that the story of hannibal crossing the alps was made up did he just take the shortcut via massalia and liguria in the south did he use the carthaginian fleet to invade northern italy
28255 how did books like gorgias or republic survive to these days where were they found or how were they preserved so well for the centuries when antique philosophers were rejected as atheists and are the originals still around or are the current versions only multiple transcriptions
28269 think all of us must have seen the following scene in film or read it in book it is night and there are cows standing in field all of sudden flying saucer appears and starts to beam the cows up to perform horrible with them this clich has been used countless times and the green aliens with big eyes clearly has preference for cow suspect this rather odd scene has single origin somewhere in the ties or ties what is the origin of the cow abducting meme
28288 this documentary circa discusses the renaissance in toledo to me that seems plausible the knowledge and culture brought by the moors seems much better catalyzer to escape the dark ages mindset than whatever happened in italy thats said to have triggered the renaissance ive heard once even that the knowledge of ancient greece came into europe through the moors actually translated from arab the word alchemy is sign this might have been the case the fall of granada the last islamic state in the iberian peninsula dates the same year that christopher columbus reached the new world and years before brazil was discovered interestingly dont remember my brazilian history teachers saying anything about muslims in europe and god forbid they had nothing to do with the discovery of whole new continent how much of the success in the spanish and portuguese colonization can be attributed to the moorish occupation and what they brought culture and knowledge to the iberian peninsula
28347 why do the horses have too many legs they appear to have an extra set why is this
28445 nearly every nation deployed tanks in world war ii what are some differences in tactics between the eastern front in russia and eastern europe and the western front in france the low countries and germany on the western front im specifically interested post day some specific questions relating to the topic differences in german armored tactics between the fronts differences in how each front utilized anti tank weaponry differences in how often forces combined infantry and armor the prevalence of tank only groups vs mixed unit groups
28456 leaving aside the naval battles of the pacific why did the japanese army do so poorly against allied forces specifically united states and australian forces when on the defensive while logistics and weight of numbers may indicate inevitable allied victory in island battles particularly later in the war this does not explain why well embedded predominately high morale troops with carefully designed defensive plans and structures almost always fared worse than invading forces while the battle of kaiapit is great example of this where australia lost men to over imperial disparity of losses is reflected in almost all areas of the pacific theatre except china right through to and including the battle of okinawa what is the explanation for this it was not as if the imperial army had not had ample training and experience and while japanese armour was weak and in short supply artillery and gun emplacements are more important in defensive tactics and these the imperial army seemed to have plenty of
28462 am sure from different sources that his men were willing to fight to the death even if they were surrounded also if they were willing to fight in the first place because the issue was so important why did he give up there why not keep fighting this still baffles me does anyone know why
28464 after the loss of world war one by germany and austria the allies convened to discuss in the paris peace talks it is understandable that germany and austria were not allowed to participate in these peace talks what dont understand is why russia wasnt invited to participate hadnt they helped the allies win the war by attacking germany on the eastern front understand they were communist but werent they major factor in the victory of world war one
28479 arguably the high water mark of the german eastern front campaign was the capture of sevastopol by general erich von manstein who was arguably germanys best general after this victory he and his 11th army were transferred to the leningrad front where he was expected to earn similar success his plan for an assault on leningrad was forestalled by an unexpected soviet spoiling attack at sinyavino by nearly troops that had escaped the attention of german military intelligence the effect of one extra army for each side was draw rather than victory for one side or another william shirer in the rise and fall of the third reich and walter kerr in the secret of stalingrad allege that germany military intelligence underestimated the available soviet troop strength by million men some of these men perhaps formed part of the sinyavino force and many of them found their way to stalingrad during the siege or the caucasus questions do historians believe that the germans were badly informed about soviet force strength around leningrad and that only the fortuitous transfer of mansteins 11th army allowed for german draw rather than loss the breaking of the leningrad siege and the rolling back of army group north are there historians who argue that the germans underestimated soviet strength in the south to such degree that even if mansteins divisions had been sent to the caucasus or to relieve stalingrad that they would have been drop in the bucket against the actual soviet forces as opposed to the ones that the germans had identified
28521 when the german sixth army was surrounded at stalingrad there were something like soldiers perhaps survived the siege to surrender two and half months later and of these about survived the war less than survival rate within this group survival chances were very unequal by rank it would not surprise me that most if not all of the generals survived they got special rations during the siege and were treated relatively well in captivity to lesser extent the same would be true for other officers especially colonels and lieutenant colonels etc even non commissioned officers would have more privileges and hence more survival chances than junior enlisted soldiers read of the survival and homecoming of one emil metzger in barbarians at the gates but he was second lieutenant he was also small man about minimum size for soldier meaning that his food rations went further than they would for most others were there accounts of the lowest ranking junior enlisted soldiers privates surviving both the siege and captivity and if so how did they work in some strategic area such as food processing did they make deal with their soviet captors one exception to the rule was chief of staff general kurt zeitzler in berlin who put himself on soldiers rations of four ounces of bread and four ounces of meat day during the siege until hitler noted his weight loss and ordered him to stop
28558 so its and the us constitution has just come into force who is now citizen of this new government were some granted citizenship automatically or were there also forms to fill out and oaths to take
28579 during military campaigns in the 19th century many soldiers died of diseases why did the military leaders not seem to pay as much attention to the importance of supply to the army let me give some examples in france sent soldiers to crush the rebels on haiti but the campaign failed because almost all of the soldiers died of disease british invasions of the river plate spanish argentina in the invasion failed because of disease finally the french egypt campaign many french soldiers died of plague but why did many of the locals and the ottoman soldiers not die and why didnt the french take the measures that the others did to prevent plague
28580 suppose im contemporary of aristotle living in athens and want to write book on say philosophy or mathematics suppose would start by writing out complete manuscript on some form of paper but then what happens were there companies established to professionally copy manuscripts by hand and distribute them how many copies would be produced and who would they be sold to how much would someone pay for book and who would they pay did the original author get royalties if not what would be the authors incentives for writing book
28589 ive read the obvious wiki article which is rather small but did not really find an answer at the end of the article it says to prepare for an invasion of the dutch east indies some japanese troops invaded southern indochina on july japanese forces remained in indochina until the end of world war ii those are literally the last sentences of the article it also mentioned negotiations with vichy france which might lead me to believe that the region was simply transferred to japanese control without any fighting thats rather unbelievable imo and the article neither says that explicitly nor makes single inline citation of source how did japan conquer this region obviously im interested in what japan did successfully that france america and china apparently did not do in the vietnam war parts and
28596 heard this interesting dialog in season of mad men you know how hitler got neville chamberlain to give him everything at munich he held the conference at an old palace that forbade smoking and after an hour and half of not smoking neville chamberlain would have given hitler his mother as dance partner ive been trying to seek clarity of this online but havent been able to find anything useful mad men usually tries to honour history but did this really happen guess the latter part of the statement which suggests why things went the way they did is subjective but what about the actual setting of the meeting
28604 they could mine copper and silver but not iron was there reason to not use such materials to build advanced mining tools to work with iron what was their main limitation couldnt they build something like big tumi but pike shaped as tool suitable for mining iron edit tumi is parallel of any sharp tool knives they had pretty good primitive metallurgy to develop that to the extent of even using them as currency in pacific sea regions so my question is what was their limitation to work with iron edit in particular when bronze and copper were used to non religious purposes to this extent iron could have been used as well but was not the case edit fixed the question title bit since stuff about former civilizations was wrong and being wrong is what makes me ask even more this question the claim is from wikipedia tumis had many shapes and purposes these were used as currency
28665 hope this isnt too general but am talking about any warfare before the invention of firearms in one vs one duel between sword and pole arm it seems like the pole arm has significant advantages pole arm can reach the sword wielder while the sword wielder sure if the sword wielder gets close he can do lot of damage but getting close is extremely risky and tricky few advantages of the sword that could think of is being able to use shield and being more mobile but do these advantages really outweigh the advantages of the pole arm believe sword users are also much more vulnerable to cavalry than pole arms
28701 prior to the 20th century im curious as to how the 2nd amendment was understood well regulated militia being necessary to the security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed there doesnt seem to be any serious controversy in the us about whether person should able to own heavy military weaponry mortars grenade launchers chemical weapons artillery mines nuclear bombs etc the only serious disagreement is around weapons that person can carry on his or her person this seems little arbitrary to me as think the term arms referred to more than carried weapons at the time the constitution was written obviously many of the weapons listed above did not exist at that time but there were at least cannon and mortars was the right to keep and bear arms considered to extend to any form of weaponry in the early 19th century if it was when did this understanding change on determining google search that felt wouldnt cause the atf to knock on my door it seems that these weapons fall under the category of destructive device per the national firearms act read on non authoritative site that permit is required to own such device and not all states allow them to be owned at all prior to that law being passed were there weapons regulations at the state level anywhere in the us please refrain from discussing the current politics around firearms answers should only address historical understanding and precedents thanks
28742 my understanding of telegraphs is that you can only send one message at time over one cable if that is not accurate then this question is pointless am curious how telegraph communication was run when the cables were first laid on the bottom of the ocean britain to india did they lay multiple cables or just one how did they keep other organizations from cutting them where they came up from the water and if someone did how long did it take them to find the damaged spot and repair it was the government and business competing over availability of telegraph lines if so how did this play out
28787 after the battle of hastings william defeated the english with men what dont understand fully is how an army of can maintain control over england which had around million people living there at the time perhaps this is not the best question since william did have claim to the throne what im asking essentially is how did nations control other conquered nations when the armies they had were fractions of the actual populations of the conquered nations
28799 teddy roosevelt appears on mount rushmore and wikipedias historical rankings of presidents of the united states page reveals almost unanimous love for teddy but why from what know about his time in office he was perhaps the presidencys most colorful figure of all time he was great conservationist he won the nobel peace prize for negotiating peace between japan and russia he invested in the navy and emphasized the growing perception of the usa as global naval power by among other things sending the great white fleet around the world outlined an ambitious progressive domestic policy but was blocked by congress on much of it is there other major stuff that im missing
28808 most countries define the age of adulthood at years why is this was there some historical precedent set in ancient rome greece or something like that why years and not some nicer number like or
28836 the thirteen colonies rebelled after no taxation without representation and great britain probably could have appeased them for quite some time the same way they did canada who stayed with great britain against america why didnt great britain give the colonies seats in parliament in contrast to british rule over india where small country occupied larger and foreign cultured country americans at the time were mostly the same british citizens who spoke english and were only few generations off the boat
28999 my understanding which could be wrong is the following during and before the period of the fall of western rome roughly ad the franks and the alemanni were tribal people who moved around lot the romans called both of those people germans so they must have been quite similar assume they must have intermingled quite lot since they were in constant contact with one another once the dark ages began the franks sort of stayed where france is now and the alemanni stayed where germany is now though the lines must have been blurry since charlemagne was frank but ive heard germans call him karl der grosse and claim him as being german right so based on that background how come the french and german language have evolved to be so different or were they already very different back then if so why and how
29011 constantinople repelled the sieges of and with greek fire what were the differences between the byzantine army navy in versus and how did the arab army navy differ from the ottoman army navy
29028 was inspired by the other question why are the german and french languages so different but while for me the answer was obvious the romans did not conquer most parts of todays germany and so on another question came into my mind and its answer is less obvious firstly take for example germanys close neighbour france what are frenchmen called in other european languages german franzosen italian francesi dutch fransen polish francuzi russian frantsuzy norwegian fransk you get the point all of these are extremely similar to each other but now look how the germans are called in other languages french allemand italian tedeschi reads tedeskee dutch duitsers polish niemcy russian nemtsy norwegian tysk why are there so many different varieties compared to french
29049 the coat of arms of li ge consists of column called perron with lions at the base the column is flanked by the letters and what do the letters and stand for my guess is latin phrase but cannot think of what phrase relates to li ge
29195 we all know that the ancient greeks believed that their gods lived on top of the mountain olympus and some of them in other places like the underworld but olympus they knew where it was between macedon and thessaly and also that mountain was never higher than meters so it was always pretty well climbable even in former times is there any evidence of the ancient greeks climbing mount olympus
30228 note links go to realistically portrayed scenes of ww2 combat am watching youtube clips of ww2 miniseries like the pacific and band of brothers based on non scientific survey of these miniseries it looks like us marines and soldiers buckle their chin straps in landing craft or aircraft and unbuckle them once they hit the landing zone like here or here or here or here the chin strap will either dangle photogenically or the helmet will appear to have had its strap completely removed what happens when you are in war zone with your chin strap unbuckled you lose your helmet losing your helmet in war zone is bad thing unless you are lead actor and will survive for dramaturgical reasons now the advantages of having your chin strap buckled appear obvious to me so id assume they would be as obvious to us marines or soldiers and to actors playing them they certainly did to my drill instructor twenty years ago who did not want to see us with dangling straps so have to assume that someone told the actors to unbuckle the chin straps did ww2 marines and soldiers actually go into action with their chin straps unbuckled if so what was the reason if not were actors in these miniseries actively told to unbuckle their straps if so what was the reason for that incidentally history se suggests that this question may already have my answer did the celts really go into battle naked umm not quite
30234 original question was this were there any ancient cultures say more than years old that were accepting of open or partially open homosexuality in either men or women for the purposes of this question dont count pedophilia reworded question see from the answers that pedophilia cant be completely separated from ancient concepts of sexuality sex with children was not considered sexual orientation it appears more relevant concept was the role that person took in the relationship or possibly sex act with children or slaves of either gender considered the more passive role or the younger man was more passive or freeman was the more active role and so forth if anyone would like to amplify or clarify that feel free
30383 the strait of gibraltar at its narrowest point is about km wide why didnt germany blockade it during ww2 it seems to me that only handful of submarines and destroyers could do the job wasnt the german navy kriegsmarine capable of blockading it did submarine wolf packs at least hunt at that chokepoint the blockade would apply to us uk ussr ships but allow spanish and other neutral countries of course presumably this would not be political problem for spain note im not talking about the gibraltar fortress under british control thats different matter
30387 the norse are the only people that we can verify today had pre columbian contact with the new world while its clear that their settlements didnt last it does appear that they interacted with the native people of north america what find interesting and bit puzzling is that their contact did not result in the spread of smallpox or other infectious diseases that in post columbian contact led to the deaths of millions of amerindians in order to answer the question above thought it would be important to know how prevalent smallpox or any other diseases that amerindians succumbed to were among the vikings around the year are there records of plagues around that time period or other indications that the norse were equally as likely to carry smallpox as say the spanish
30389 im going to take it as an article of faith that if one power britain controlled both the rock of gibraltar to the north and the algerian coast to the south that this country would be able to blockade the strait of gibraltar up to the torch landings however the ability to control was split with britain controlling the rock of gibraltar and german controlled vichy france occupying the algerian coastline did that mean that neither side could blockade the strait because it was push or was it true that britain was able to blockade the strait more against the axis than vice versa because of her superior navy part of which was based on the rock of gibraltar my understanding was that the allies had pretty much smooth sailing through the strait while axis ships had to sneak through it this questions is different from the one about why the germans didnt blockade the straits because wanted to explore the problems that both sides allied and german had in blockading gibraltar am under the impression that the allies could establish only partial blockade of gibraltar until they could close off the southern algerian shore following torch and likewise that germany and or italy could establish minimal blockade or anti blockade by establishing air bases in algeria although they never got around to doing so
30404 im quite interested in ww2 and was thinking about the beaches of normandy and what wondering about the following could hitler have won ww2 after losing the beaches of normandy and what were the key points in hitlers actual defeat at normandy if so how what would he have to had done differently and if not how come
30419 former british colony id have thought that india would use western military hardware during the cold war in fact they fought shoulder to shoulder with british soldiers against the japanese india was natural ally of the west one explanation can think of silly as it might sound is after world war two the us sold weapons to pakistan india purchased soviet military hardware to spite the americans am wrong
30459 am trying to understand under which conditions battles are predominantly remembered and commemorated by the losing party who acknowledge their defeat not the victors this is not who gets to write the history of battle but which losing party appropriates it and why and directly related when do winners refrain from commemorating battle am not interested in complete list but in the conditions under which the loser comes to actively keep memories of the battle alive examples which come to mind are the battle of kosovo the battle of the bulge and the battle of arnhem both my question somewhat differs from this one on the writing of history by the victors is history always written by the victors
30501 saw this image on facebook and usually take whats posted there with grain of salt have reversed image searched and googled but with no luck im curious about the authenticity surrounding this letter
30514 was reading about khalid ibn al walid commander in the muslims era what is interesting about him is that he was never been defeated in any of the hundred battles that he encountered are there military commanders similar to him fought hundred of hard battles and wasnt defeated from wikipedia khalid is said to have fought around hundred battles both major battles and minor skirmishes as well as single duels during his military career having remained undefeated he is claimed by some to be one of the finest military generals in history its side question but how did he accomplish to win all of these battles without being defeated in the article it is explained that he was smart and brave but napoleon was also considered smart general with new tactics yet he was defeated in his battles
30533 virtually any time the american flag is depicted or flown it has the orientation seen in the following image with the stars in the upper hoist left quarter of the flag however when the flag is displayed as patch on the right shoulder of military police or fire uniform its orientation is right left reversed as shown here when did this reversal originate and what is the reason for it
30569 we know that the spanish armada was composed of over ships how did the duke of medina exercise any sort of control over fleet this big with only 16th century technology do we know how the ships passed commands to each other and anything about how it was organised did this command structure contribute to the eventual shipwrecking of the majority of the fleet
30571 during the battle of britain german and british planes shot down each other at roughly one to one rate this gave an advantage to the british because all of the surviving german pilots shot down over britain became prisoners of war while most of the surviving shot down british pilots were recycled and with greater experience under their belt in the shoe was on the other foot the strategic bombing initiatives featured roughly one to one losses of british and german planes the americans did better and inflicted casualties at closer to two to one rate even so would expect the germans to get benefit in relative experience from recycling surviving pilots falling in their territory while allied pilots became pows apparently the germans did not gain this benefit that is relative german experience levels fell rather than rose over time why might that be the case did the allies do better job of destroying enemy planes and pilots as opposed to shooting them down than the germans in the battle of britain did the allies successfully attack fuel supplies and other infrastructure that the germans needed for the training of pilots
30602 undoubtedly the largest empire in the existence of human history was the mongol empire once hodgepodge of warring nomadic tribes from central asia before banding together under the banner of temujin better known as genghis khan but what was the key to the mongol empires size was the horse the most ideal creature to use for long distance travel the exclusive reason or were there other factors involved
30607 the germans were very sophisticated in combined operations that is in using airpower and tanks to attack behind the soviet lines thats what gave them the advantage in the early part of the war ultimately their mobile advantages could only be fully exploited by infantry and here the germans had far fewer advantages for instance during the counterattack of operation bagration the soviets enjoyed lend lease trucks to take maximum advantage of their breakthroughs but apparently the germans had far fewer trucks or other motorized transport and relied on yes horses as result during the early days of the war large numbers of soviet troops escaped from pockets because the germans could not close the gaps between fast moving armor and slow moving infantry likewise the germans had major supply problems there were trunk rail lines through the soviet union to only parts the front and from what understand lateral communications were quite poor these gaps were largely filled by horse transport with the germans being glad to capture lend lease trucks because their own were inferior in quality and quantity so how dependent were the germans on horse transport my understanding was that the germans were actually quite primitive in this regard compared to the americans british and later soviet armies which is one reason why they lost the war and given constraints on fuel and manufacturing capacities did the germans have any choice but to be so highly dependent on horses
30636 just watched an episode of the television series flashpoint where member of the police force steps on the trigger of cr38 bounding mine has anyone survived triggering bounding mine in this way what has worked and what hasnt
30680 im looking for documented antecedents that describe the use or abuse of alcohol in the historical context of battles not necessarily well known battles remember watching many years ago discovery channel special on pirates where someone took on some battles there where fought under the influence of alcohol for some reason also ive read some very interesting questions about the use and abuse of rum and other beverages by navies in the past did pirates really drink lot of rum historical use of alcohol as source of clean water why is rum naval but they focus mainly on the generalized drinking but not on particular incident that might have taken place while or because people was under the influence of alcohol
30694 obviously if plane takes off from carrier but cant return because the carrier is damaged or sunk it has to go somewhere or if it cant reach an airfield its crew would need to ditch it and eject if possible during ww2 or other operations involving carriers were there standing orders procedures for air crew if when these situations arose are there any actual incidents you could reference
30714 in both fantasy and science fiction from books movies games and tv shows slave armies are concept that is used pretty often well known example of this is the unsullied from game of thrones some works use slave armies in roman settings however wonder was this ever used in history the concept seems really weird to me by creating slave army you have just given the slaves all they need to kill their masters and break free they have all the weapons they need and theyve gathered up large number of slaves in the same place dont see how anyone that owns slaves could ever allow slaves to hold weapons unless you have much bigger force to keep them in check so were slave armies ever used in history and if so by who and when
30739 in general we think of corporations as not acting on nations with force simply with legal power perhaps they maintain fleet of security guards we generally think of corporations as leaving the military work to the government not to say that the corporations cant influence the government strongly for particular military outcome but the idea was theyd leave it to the government armed forces to take this action yet when we read the history of the british east india company we read about the presidency armies it does appear that private corporation in that period of history maintained an armed force for interacting with nations in fact we read the brigade of gurkhas is the collective term for units of the current british army that are composed of nepalese soldiers the brigade which is strong draws its heritage from gurkha units that originally served in the indian army prior to indian independence and prior to that of the east india company my question is is there precedent for private companies maintaining military force
30782 ive been to londons river thames famous place where it is relatively easy to find ceramics and other relics of the past found something but have no idea how to distinguish ancient stuff from modern junk this is what found to be interesting is there way to see if its something from the past not the last years even if suppose this is junk it would be nice to find way to analyze those for the next time will visit that place thank you anyway
30844 as per wikipedias history of kolkata page after the territorial conquest of bengal in the british east india company pursued monopoly on production and export of opium from india the company bought opium from local traders and later directly from farmers and sold it at auction in calcutta from there much of it was smuggled to canton in china by foreign traders eventually leading to the first opium war given that calcutta was not anywhere near canton and there werent any direct routes or were there from calcutta to canton why was calcutta chosen for those auctions instead of some place closer was it simply because it was under british control or was there any other reason also what routes did these smugglers take to smuggle opium from calcutta to canton
30856 as far as know no native americans developed their own written language correct me if im wrong there may have been some numeral systems but thats all im aware of so now im wondering if any tribe ever adopted the alphabets of english spanish french russian or any other european language know some natives learned these languages and presumably some of them learned to read write in addition to speaking it this would provide an opportunity for tribe to adopt the alphabet if they wanted without being totally assimilated im using the broadest definition of native american the native can be anywhere from alaska canada greenland central america or caribbean and of course the mainland continents basically anywhere in north or south america
30893 the national health service nhs was created after world war ii so uk national debt must have been high at that point the creation of the nhs should have caused great increase in national debt did it
30942 the tv show sherlock prompted an interesting question about the historical role of women during the united kingdoms road to womens suffrage in the episode the abominable bride set in victorian london in there was scene where mrs watson says that she is part of campaign to give women the right to vote mrs watson part of campaign you know lestrade oh yeah campaign mrs watson votes for women lestrade and are you are you for or against mrs watson sternly pointing to the stairs get out the scene was played for laughs with the joke being that lestrade should have realized his question was misplaced being woman of course she would want the right to vote but this made me wonder were there women in this era who historically were against giving women the right to vote if so what were their reasons am interested in either organized campaigns led by women or prominent women who held this view id like to know about uk movements but similar movements outside of the uk would be interesting supplementary information too
31040 the kingdom of aksum is known for its trading prowess with trade partners as far away as india do we know what kinds of ships they built and used ethiopian freshwater tankwas are made of papyrus but this sounds too flimsy for the open ocean and ive never seen one big enough to use as cargo vessel edit removed open and added note about size as was really trying to compare tankwa use today on lake tana to the size and stability of ship that could travel from adulis to india personally id prefer if they used technology similar to the baghlah dhow but cant tell if they or sufficiently large precursor ship were available that far back copying roman designs would fit the classic eurocentric model of history and kind of hope it isnt true im also uncertain whether aksum would have had access to enough trees near the coast to support any substantial number of wooden vessels edit this discussion is bringing up lot of useful ideas for me and id like to upvote comments especially the note about lateen sails but apparently still lack the reputation to make it happen
31049 in russia leased port arthur manchuria as pacific port to supplement its existing holding of vladivostok port arthur is at about degrees latitude vladivostok is at degrees latitude for reference seattle washington is at degrees latitude yet vladivostok is much colder than port arthur and also much colder than seattle why is that read something about siberian front from lake baikal that affects vladivostok yet port arthur is almost ten degrees longitude west of vladivostok which is to say that it is closer to lake baikal so doesnt it have similar problems did it just barely miss the front and why or did russia have other reasons for preferring port arthur besides climate
31097 my understanding which could be wrong is that armies in the civil war were bloody in the sense that soldiers did not retreat or were sent directly into fire until one side was wiped out if im wrong about that please correct me im just curious why the north and south didnt use guerrilla fighting techniques by which mean taking cover spreading out etc if these techniques were helpful in the revolutionary war it might be that my understanding of battle history is wrong but in general im interested in the historical context by which the revolutionary war was called englands vietnam due to englands armys inflexibility compared to colonist soldiers while somehow years later these inflexible fighting techniques were used
31112 after fall of world war on the western front was characterized by trench warfare that is to say that soldiers in trenches protected by machine guns and barbed wire occupied such strong defenses that attacks involving hundreds of thousands of men would do well to advance few miles at time this lasted until the spring of when german numerical superiority and new storm tactics upset the balance one way and the arrival of fresh american troops and new equipment such as tanks upset the balance the other way germanys eastern front was not nearly as static against the russians why was that was it because of factors such as weather and terrain or were the russians slower to adopt trench warfare tactics than the germans british or french
31128 so was reading my history text and it states that horses were likely hunted to extinction in north america however many movies and books display native americans as in tune with nature horse whisperers is this false display or did native americans have access to horses from some source that led to this portrayal overall want to know what real life facts events have led to this portrayal of native americans in popular culture
32186 acknowledging that society and culture are broadly influenced by religion understanding that society and the religion of that society are frequently inextricably connected is there such thing as an extinction event for religion are there any examples of that type of wholesale abandonment of religion what causes society to abandon its own religion for another religion or for secularism this question does not concern gradual reduction in belief but only an abrupt no longer than one year shift by the majority of the group the following are possible reasons exposure to another culture advances in science technology natural environmental disasters political change in government historical examples are needed to confirm or refute these suppositions
32188 am going to be portraying mark twain on the lecture circuit circa want to make the performance as realistic as possible so that the sufferers audience can adopt willing suspension of disbelief and imagine they really are back in that era the or problem is amplification am tempted to use none rather than wear concealed mic to reproduce the technology of the time as much as possible but how did they do it how were speakers of that pre amplification era able to make themselves heard to large crowds was it matter of using the wooden floorboards of the stage as literal sounding boards bouncing their utterances off them or what technique was used certainly they didnt shout their lungs out update all of the comments are useful to one degree or another but would still like to know if the floorboards must be used as sounding boards iow is it advantageous to aim downwards to bounce the sound off the wood
32248 is there somewhat established term for one culture not state having comparatively large influence over surrounding neighboring cultures not talking about the volitional political or military influence or control of country where the terms hegemony or soft power when one country gets other countries to want what it wants come to mind rather mean when surrounding cultures voluntarily imitate adapt import and include the fashion architecture technology and ways of thinking and writing of the other culture even if this is not desired or especially promoted by said culture of course military power may very well preceede the phase looking for and in turn the phase looking for may very well preceede becoming soft power but neither are necessary examples in the west are probably the roman empire vis vis the germanics the catholic church and later the french and then british high societies as well as the american way of life after ww2 or the influence of chinese culture over surrounding peoples
32268 recently ive been searching lot about scotland ireland wales and england one after the other england vassalized its neighbors and became the head of great britain can understand that wales which was really decentralized couldnt really stop the english but for scotland and ireland how was it done in history lessons we learn that ireland was effectively separated into many fiefdoms before the british invasion but supposedly united against invaders thus how could they lose their lands so easily was their army too old was there no will to keep their lands for scotland they indeed often fought against england and often allied with france for protection they were nonetheless crushed by the english why is that was their economy too bad to sustain their army supplies trouble
32285 why does the path of the great wall of china bend back and forth so much na vely it would have taken less material and guards to defend if it had taken straighter path so there must have been some reason but what
32289 have read many sources regarding illyrian and thracian cultures but it seems that their culture is not studied as much as their more relevant neighbours the hellenes understand that they have not left many written sources but still it seems that despite their role and geographical extension in the balkans they have not been studied as others that were similarly situated what accounts for the historiography or lack thereof for these peoples
32367 the question id like to know how did people especially males used to dress while sleeping in the middle ages in europe suppose the nightwear changes both according to the exact time period and to where in europe mostly because of the different climate but culture might be another factor why im wondering about this know something about day dresses because of medieval fairs but at night can only imagine tunics and maybe some form of underwear got told underwear did not exist at the time but im not sure christianity would have allowed people to sleep together with nothing under the tunic were night trousers such as in modern pajamas thing note if too broad if differences are really great the tendencies for the middle upper class not poor not noble around the end of the middle ages period in christian central and northwestern europe germany france england interest me more
32383 in during the first world war the germans dropped the idea of using the pickelhaube because it wasnt practical in the trenches read the wiki but am left with one question it remained in service for more than years it doesnt seem to be practical at all and its additional combat value looks negligible did it have any real practical use source dr max litthauer pickelhaube spiked helmet with camouflage covering donated by bart ullstein jewish museum berlin
32421 while reading charles omans history of the art of war in the middle ages it occurred to me that horses and kind of knight were always available to the roman empire and nevertheless the legions were mostly composed of infantry he even says that the highest ratio that horseback soldiers had compared to infantry at any given time was and that normally it didnt surpass after this the author proceeds to highlight that cavalry was major advance in the art of war after the roman empire and that mounted knights always won battles against infantry this created my doubt if horsemen were so superior in battle why were the legions composed mostly of infantry something that oman says is that after the roman empire there were mounted archers instead of mounted infantry was that the major advancement in military technique as the book was written in maybe some of the information may be outdated and today we may have different vision if so what did we discover in this matter since
32444 assume this beach scenario was typical on day graphic violence it shows landing craft reaching the shore where it lowers hatch on the front of the craft exposing the invading soldiers to hail of bullets its like shooting fish in barrel the ones who survive seem to do so by hopping over the side of the boat into the water so why on earth did the boats open at the front
32452 ive seen estimates of the range of round shot fired from smoothbore cannons during various eras is there simple estimate how far cannon ball would continue bouncing rolling on dry level ground following the initial impact
32459 from reading the web understand that the empire was in terrible state this was the result of several decades of losing battles nationalistic uprisings and opposition to reform that resulted in the ottoman empire being the original reference of the sick man of europe sultan mehmed knew this and wanted to remain neutral as there was little possibility for largely agrarian society to triumph over industrialized powers however for some reason mehmeds advisors wanted them to join the war as result of pressure from them mehmed eventually relented this really confuses me as there seems no reason for the sultan to agree or for his advisors to want war when their position was so weak apprently they had lost many of their weapons in the balkan wars year earlier and were unable to replenish them could someone provide more color on this edit ive already read the wiki page but it only says that they couldnt remain neutral not why looking at the map doubt the central powers would have wanted to open another front when they are already surrounded considering that russias military was poorly armed at the time believe they would have preferred to focus on fighting the germans
32470 this is probably very naive question but here it goes was there an economical or political reason for the invasion of tibet by china in it does not seem to me that tibet is particularly wealthy place is there some resources there that did not hear about did the chinese government need to distract its people for some reason or is it just that the bigger you are the better for you and tibet was simply colonised its true that china has claimed tibet but why would china claim such barren land does it have some sort of strategic value and if so what would it be
32480 the perry expedition succeeded in opening japan to trade with the usa from wikipedia we learn that around the same time the russians also attempted the same thing the dutch already had some weak agreement with the japanese dont understand why they would consider using force in order to make the japanese their partners perry had orders to use force if necessary diplomacy bribery etc sure but risking war seems not profitable especially since that war would be waged against an isolated nation there could be no guarantees as to what could be expected one of the reasons is stated as the americans were also driven by concepts of manifest destiny and the desire to impose the benefits of western civilization and the christian religion on what they perceived as backwards asian nations particularly in the case of the us this is an unsurprising reason but also one specific umbrella for various hostile agendas all throughout modern history the benefits of americans bringing democracy are evident so its inconclusive another reason the growing commerce between america and china the presence of american whalers in waters offshore japan and the increasing monopolization of potential coaling stations by the british and french in asia again it is unclear to me how potential conflict would help there since it would disrupt trade endanger the whalers and only worsen the position of the usa against the british and french the question is phrased for nations rather than usa intentionally as im interested in other general motivations as well the usa are only prominent example since they succeeded in forcing an agreement
32495 having just watched the imitation game am curious about the influence of the cracking of enigma on the outcome of wwii which battles did the information decoded by enigma influence which battles would likely have been lost without the cracking of the code
32510 in montaignes essay of cannibals montaigne writes know not said he what kind of barbarians for so the greeks called all other nations these may be but the disposition of this army that see has nothing of barbarism in it plutarch life of pyrrhus as much said the greeks of that which flaminius brought into their country and philip beholding from an eminence the order and distribution of the roman camp formed in his kingdom by publius sulpicius galba spoke to the same effect what is the sentence in bold referring to when it talks of that which flaminius brought into their country the wiki link for flaminius seems to imply that all he did was sell cheap grain in rome but dont know how that has anything to do with the sentence theres also another person called flamininus so was it maybe typo
32511 in napoleon invaded egypt and in he invaded the middle east the only thing that stopped him from going further was the fortifications of acre which he could not take what was his plans if he actually took acre much read were only theories he would take the great cities of jerusalem and damascus what was the plan to go further another theory is that from there he would conquer persia and india but is this true or is it pure theories and gossip read in the letters of napoleon that he talk about two generals before him alexander the great who marched through persia and reached india and nader shah general from persia who took delhi and baghdad so is it likely that he truly wanted to go in their footprints also read that sultan tipu of mysore wrote letter to napoleon which reads he waited for him to come and liberate mysore from the british
32569 initially was surprised to learn that such thing as an anti tank rifle even exists it seems ludicrous idea to try to shoot tank with rifle but lets suppose that the bullet really hits lucky velocity angle combination and penetrates the armor of the tank what next was the point of anti tank rifles to wound or kill the crew hit the ammunition magazine if the shot failed to do any of these objectives could it cause any damage to the tank if you imagine tank it is huge armored box the chance of hitting vital point seems incredibly small are there some statistics saying if tank was hit by anti tank rifle what are the odds of putting it out of action
32632 was public transportation free in the soviet union im interested in the metros and buses if not what did they cost im most interested in the period around the late 1950s early 1960s but it would be interesting to know if the situation changed at any time during the ussrs lifespan
32647 from my previous related question public transport was not free in the ussr it seems prices were very low around to kopecks this seems so low that im surprised the government didnt simply pay it all for free via taxes and state run business revenues im wondering if the cost of enforcing public transport could match or exceed the profits how was it enforced turnstiles ticket booths did someone always check your ticket when getting on the vehicle how and where were tickets bought im interested in the metro buses and trams for the period around late 1950s or early 1960s after the ruble reform is fine
32651 wikipedia states african population doubled in the period and quadrupled from according to united nations estimates is there consensus on the causes behind this rapid growth in africa specifically am interested in potential global and political factors and policies that may have impacted this phenomenon
32668 there are number of versions of how chrysippus died one of which says he drank some overproof wine while another says that he died of laughter apparently he died laughing at his own joke the story goes something like this one day on his way home chrysippus came across an ass eating figs he instructed the old woman who lived with him to give the ass some unmixed wine to drink afterwards and with that he laughed so violently he died or according to wikipedia in the second account he was watching donkey eat some figs and cried out now give the donkey drink of pure wine to wash down the figs whereupon he died in fit of laughter dont know if it is the zeitgeist or some weird stoic sense of humor but the joke is completely lost on me found multiple sources telling the story but none provided an explanation can someone explain why somebody in that time period ca bc would find that joke hilarious
32683 was rereading winston churchills their finest hour speech and came across this passage in reference to the threat from bombing attacks do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which lies before us but believe our countrymen will show themselves capable of standing up to it like the brave men of barcelona and will be able to stand up to it and carry on in spite of it at least as well as any other people in the world emphasis mine spain of course was neutral country at the time so what incident involving barcelona is he referring to here
32694 in the soviet union did most people own bicycle were streets crowded with bikes or was there shortage of bikes what was the price of bikes and were they affordable the time period im most interested in is early 1960s im concerned about big cities only not rural areas
32703 four us marshalls escorted ruby bridges into louisiana school ending the new orleans school desegregation crisis one of the marshals was charles burks but who were the other three
32780 during ww2 thailand declared war on england and us collaborated with the japanese in exchange for being able to invade shan state westwards and north as far as china thai soldiers were ordered to fight alongside with japanese in malaya and burma thailand was at least allied with the axis after the war they just had to give back the territory and some bags of rice think how come they were let off the hook so easily why didnt the allies go harder on their former enemy thailand and also the leader phibun just resigned to compare quisling was shot personally would just say that buddhist mentality does not have death penalty as an easy option my account of the history is highly simplified and may be wrong in some parts am traveler and have seen these areas first hand and heard the stories so therefore am interested am no historian hope possible faults in my account will be corrected
32793 what is the longest sustained retreat by military force in history by total length not counting naval examples as they can be much longer when search for it get lot of results to the battle of the chongchon river which is the longest retreat in us history but at mi km it is dwarfed by more famous retreat of the french from moscow still that may not be the longest in all history which one is the longest
32805 this is something ive always wondered but couldnt imagine what the answer could be and havent found much material elsewhere nazi germany paired with italy and japan was waging war on the world during wwii germany for its part was focusing on europe north africa and later on russia but what was nazi germanys end goal lets say the us never got involved when and how it did and lets say things went better for the germans in russia would they have continued expanding were they trying to establish new world order and dominance that plan seems foolhardy to me in the extreme theres no possible way small country like germany could possible keep the entire world under check as it expands it decreases its influence and ability to control any one area it seems their defeat was inevitable no matter the course of events at the very least they would have found attacking and destroying the americas especially the us even with the help of japan nearly insurmountable goal given its shear size population and technical military abilities so just how was nazi germany hoping wwii would end
32813 the czech legion was allied with the russian tsars just prior to the russian revolution after the bolsheviks took power they were unable to return via europe so they crossed the whole of eurasia over period of years and eventually exited the country via vladivostok in the process they played an important part in the russian revolution the question is simple how did they get home in the article above they say this the troops dispersed aboard series of ships that carried them back to europe via the indian ocean others sailed across the pacific and through the panama canal eventually all were repatriated find this to be kind of tease of course they crossed oceans on boats to get home were these czech ships british ships were they just passenger ships what kind of ships were having vladivostok as port of call at this time who paid for them to get home heres the link to the wikipedia page for czech legion previous se history mention of czech legion

32839 before the formation of the soviet union and or before international travel restrictions were imposed were there russian ukranian etc citizens living legally in foreign countries as permanent residents or dual citizens what happened to them when the soviet government restricted international travel for soviet citizens were they generally left alone or were they ultimately compelled to return to the soviet union
32840 did it happen that sovereign country voluntarily decided to become territory of another country by voluntarily mean it could have had the choice to say no even better if the joining country was the one who initiated the process the anschluss of austria did include vote where the austrians voted to join germany but wouldnt really count it as germany was applying huge pressure and hitler would have been unlikely to take no as an answer the unification of germany and italy in the late 19th century would be better examples but they also have their issues in both cases it was one stronger country conquering the others even if by diplomatic pressure instead of military force in many cases the closest could find was the republic of texas but there are some issues it was just very short lived temporary country which just broke away from country and soon joined another one it was diplomatically recognized by quite few countries were there examples with more established countries who voluntarily choosed to become part of another country or even better initiated this by themselves without an imminent threat of being invaded

32936 in the 1980s the united states navy introduced both the arleigh burke class and the ticonderoga class wikipedia pages on them https en wikipedia org wiki arleigh burke class destroyer development https en wikipedia org wiki ticonderoga class cruiser the length beam and tonnage of these vessels is all similar the arleigh burke class is considered destroyer whereas the ticonderoga is considered cruiser the top speed of the vessels is also similar neither possesses novel form of propulsion such as nuclear propulsion the armament of the vessels is incredibly similar notably both carry the mk vertical launch system do notice that wikipedia lists the cruiser mark of the ticonderoga class as having the mk missile launcher this is not part of the aegis system which is the modern missile combat system used by the united states navy it seems that these vessels are almost identical in their capabilities and construction what were the needs of the united states navy that resulted in the acquisition of such similar classes of combat vessels im interested mostly in the mindset or perceived needs of the navy why would the navy introduce and continue to construct such similar classes of vessels do they differ somehow in their operational capability that is not evident

32977 recently visited the colosseum in rome where tour guide explained about the different seating sections for the elite senators and the like nobles ordinary citizens and slaves women he also talked about the different gates and said that entry tickets were numbered by gate later found discussion of all this on wikipedia the tour made me wonder what did it cost to go to an event at the colosseum in rome in the first century soon after the colosseum was built that slaves and women attended means it was possible for people with little wealth to attend but the existence of the tickets suggests that it wasnt free for all anybody can just come in or was it free but you had to get ticket first to prevent running out of spaces while some of the events at the colosseum were discretionary entertainment so if it was too pricy for some that was ok others seemed to be designed as public spectacles like executions so maybe there were different entry policies for different types of events after all performance venue today doesnt always have one fixed price if there was cost id like to understand it in relation to other economic aspects an answer like denari isnt as helpful to me as something like the cost of loaf of bread or days wages for an ordinary citizen because dont know very much about ancient roman economics

33103 it seems using sling is far more effective than throwing things with your bare hands as far as know slingers were widespread in the ancient era as well as in the middle ages however in xix xx hand grenades were thrown well by hand googling sling grenadier gives bunch of fantasy troops the only one mention was the spanish civil war sling grenadiers slings were way more compact in comparison with grenade launcher however using slings for throwing grenades wasnt so popular or was it and why updates there are situations where you actually cant use sling trenches indoor under fire etc im not talking about using sling every time instead of throwing grenade by hand but in addition to its like rock you can use it as sling ammo but you can still throw it by hand no problems slings have low accuracy sling target used for competitions is meter wide you are supposed to hit it from meter distance so slings have decent accuracy grenades have another use cases indeed you dont need long distance to say throw grenade into room but there are still use cases where you need that distance thats why we have grenade launchers but you cant carry grenade launcher in your pocket also sling are way cheaper fusing problems know grenades have safety handles and youre supposed to grip it when you throw grenade using sling will make this mechanism unsafe and doubtful but that is kind of deductive fallacy grenades have safety handles because we throw them by hand if slings were used there would be different safety mechanisms
33140 throughout the second world war many people in spain were under the hope that the victory of the allies would trigger an invasion of spain to defeat the dictatorship of franco fascist who won the civil war in thanks to the help of mussolinis italy and hitlers germany it is known fact that britain bribed spain to stay out of second world war there are other reasons that are very well detailed in why were spain and portugal neutral not invaded in wwii despite all of this there were quite lot of volunteers even many sent to russia by the government itself the divisi azul to russia throughout the war spains government moved from supporting the axis powers to calling themselves neutral as it was fearing the defeat of the axis powers things changed by executions of former republicans decreased when mussolini was captured in july franco moved his position towards neutrality general franco was pressured to stop selling tungsten to germany references in this page from wikipedia in spanish by february the yalta conference got an agreement that would be important to spain the big three further agreed that democracies would be established all liberated european and former axis satellite countries would hold free elections and that order would be restored however the only thing that really happened was gathering of volunteers for guerrilla like invasion following the spanish civil war many supporters of the former republican government decided to start movement to overthrow franco these members were called the spanish maquis several guerrilla raids occurred during the timeline of world war ii with most of them happening in one major confrontation happened in the vale de ar valley where large group of rebels attacked and briefly occupied the north western border of the pyrenees the government of france along with the soviet union organised trained and armed large group of spaniards earlier liberated from the concentration camps where spanish republicans had been held by the front populaire since they crossed the spanish french border at the end of the spanish civil war in the battle lasted four days the better trained and motivated spanish army under the command of the experienced general moscard immediately maneuvered to control the main strategic points of the valley and engaged the invaders pushing them back across the border the communists had underestimated popular support for the francoist regime and no revolution began as they supposed source spain during world war ii all in all spain got isolated many war criminals got shelter in the country and the dictatorship managed to survive many years until the death of franco in this happened to the surprise of republicans who had already faced the coldness during the civil war when they suffered from the non intervention of the democracies then it was only by mid 1950s when spain was on the focus again when required to host some unos headquarters during the cold war why was this what caused this coldness towards spain despite being fascist regime were there any plans to force the fall of the regime
33217 in the united states air force including the air reserve component air force reserve and air national guard gold represents the lower form of rank gold bar ranks below silver bar gold leaf ranks below silver leaf it seems to me that the military takes its symbols very seriously and thus im wondering what the rationale is for this given that in the civilian world gold generally symbolizes the best form of something or at least better than silver note ive only been focused on the air force however just noticed this applied to all of the us military
33222 anything that moved he was ready to shoot said lebow his personal record was reportedly kills in day franz ferdinand tallied his kills in massive journal the grand sum of pheasant partridge and ground game that he shot was according to calculations published in archduke of sarajevo the above is an excerpt from the article things you didnt know about franz ferdinand published on pbs website from any other news source would have considered the information obviously untrue but pbs generally holds itself to high reporting standards and certainly would not stoop so low to publish outrageous clickbait my question then is how on earth can someone anyone possibly shoot almost three hundred thousand animals within mortal lifetime that was also probably mostly occupied by royal ceremonies stately duties and the like even more unbelievable the article states that he shot animals in day did the math and that evaluates to animals minute or about one animal per seconds for twenty four hours straight want to know what techniques he employed and whether he used machine gun or some armored vehicle on hunting trips because it just seems frankly impossible that someone could kill so many animals within so little time otherwise

33548 have wondered this question for long time the metal armor has enjoyed its heyday through the early human warfare history right into the renaissance then guns and cannons entered the fighting scene and all the sudden soldiers were only wearing uniform onto the battle field compare with cotton fabric metal armor can withstand more damage compared to arrows and sword cuts bullet and cannon balls were more devastating werent there even more reasons for soldier to wear metal armor

33613 in the early months of world war ii the united stated spent several millions of dollars to fortify the west coast against possible japanese attack going as far as to stretch gigantic submarine net across the juan de fuca strait and to cover the entire boeing plant in seattle with camouflaging wire net to make it look like residential suburb yet all these numerous fears of japanese attack never materialized aside from sending couple thousand bomb filled balloons across the pacific all of which fell on sparsely inhabited areas japan never even touched the west coast of america why didn the japanese attempt even single attack on the mainland what deterred them from striking such direct blow on america submarine attack would have been easy for them but they never sent known submarine beyond the territorial waters of hawaii so what the story here or were there attacks simply didn come across in all my sources about world war ii

33708 this question comes from slightly related one at the time of ww2 most us industry was on the east coast including all of the shipbuilding for carriers and battleships if the panama canal went down it would greatly reduce the logistics of the us navy in the pacific so want to know did the japanese navy have the ability to destroy it in surprise attack lets say on dec what know so far the panama canal has water locks per lane the locks have concrete walls but hollow steel gates as per this documentary https www youtube com watchv cabiktl4m at you can see they are hollow frame bomb or torpedo will probably blow hole in it though it might not be enough to instantly drain the locks japanese dive bombers had the training as evidenced by the many carrier hits they got in early ww2 coral sea midway note im talking about hits not necessarily kills reviewed those two battles and many times the us carriers got hit but survived us carriers seem lot more stalwart than japanese carriers at that time im only trying to point out that japanese dive bombers seemed to have good training and accuracy edit the panama canal locks are powered by the gatun hydroelectric dam maybe all you need to do is smash that dam and the locks are suddenly worthless do not know for sure how long it takes to repair hydroelectric dam but it has to be on the order of months from reading about bouncing bombs going after dams in germany they appear to be significant logistical targets the doolittle raid made by america got carriers cruisers and destroyers very close to japan before being detected and that was when they were already at war apr japan actually designed and built some submarine aircraft carriers meant to raid the panama canal so apparently they believed the canals defenses were not good enough to stop an aerial attack the surprise attack on pearl harbor irl was total surprise despite seeing airplanes on radar what dont know what aa defenses the canal had at that time what range and endurance japanese naval group had possibly other things that make it impossible or unlikely im trying to keep this specific so it doesnt get closed as too broad or too opinion based im asking if the japanese navy had the ability im not asking if it was viable strategy or sound war plan
33745 have read numerous times that the dred scott decision led to the civil war in the united states but have been unable to find sources to support this it seems that the dred scott decision chiefly led to other contributing factors such as the split in the democratic party and the rise of lincoln was wondering how therefore the decision actually acted as catalyst to the civil war and if there were any books or reputable sources that provide clear story

34026 when great britain brought its land and naval forces to the american shores to enforce its rule there before and after the americans declaration of independence great britains motives seem clear if it allowed dissent by the americans other colonists elsewhere might be emboldened to consider breaking ties with the king however in dedicating troops and ships to the americas britain left gaps in its imperial defenses that other nations and their navies could take advantage ultimately numerous challengers to british naval supremacy used the american distraction to pile on with their own attacks on british ships and assets essentially becoming world war continuing even after the war of is there any record that this risk was evaluated

34171 the course took on ottoman history was years ago and relatively short so please correct any and all inaccurate statements make also want to emphasize that neither genocide nor ethnic cleansing is ever justified edit want to emphasize that the armenian genocide should not be equated with the other instances of ethnic cleansing mentioned below the people who are ultimately responsible for the armenian genocide are and always will be the people who orchestrated it and implemented it there was no justifiable excuse for those actions the number of mass killings and systematic race and religion based murders was to the best of my knowledge at that time unprecedented the armenian genocide cannot itself be considered population transfer inasmuch as the vast majority of armenians were brutally and unjustifiably killed rather than displaced what was trying to ask is whether the young turk government used in part russian expansionism as rationalization for their atrocities russia conquering the ottoman empire still would have been better outcome than what actually happened namely the ottoman government senselessly and brutally murdering millions of its own citizens rationalizations rarely if ever amount to legitimate excuses or justifications of the actions in question and believe that this case is no different edit as recall after the russian empires caucasus war in the late 19th century the muslim circassians were almost entirely displaced from the caucasus with the ottoman empire absorbing the majority of refugees did the architects of the armenian genocide during world war plan their actions in part as reciprocal population transfer to force russia to absorb the christian armenians the same way russia forced the ottomans to absorb the muslim circassians remember reading that during world war all armenians even those loyal to the ottoman empire were under suspicion by the government for being fifth column supporting russia this paranoia was exacerbated by the participation of russian armenians in the war in the caucasus front the armenian genocide by killing millions of people vastly diminished the presence of armenians in eastern anatolia and caused their modern day concentration in the caucasus this is the opposite of the effect of the russian ethnic cleansing of the circassians which effectively removed the circassians from the caucasus and displaced them to anatolia thus combining the two events it seems possible that it was another instance of reciprocal ethnic cleansing euphemistically referred to as population transfers which occurred between the ottoman empire and its christian neighbors and former subjects during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to what extent can the reciprocal ethnic cleansings between the ottoman empire and greece and bulgaria respectively be traced to russian influence know that during this time period the russian empire wanted to project itself worldwide as the leader of all orthodox christians and all slavic peoples in part to justify their expansion at the expense of the ottoman empire it is well established that imperial russia was one of the most fervent supporters of the greek independence movement with catherine the great trying to install her grandson as the king of greece and if remember correctly russian intervention playing decisive role in crucial naval battle was the movement to oust muslims from the newly independent greece in part spurred on by imperial russia wanting client state more pliable to its claims of moral leadership of orthodox christians which would have been undermined by religiously diverse greece also remember reading that bulgarian nationalism was relatively non existent outside of intellectual circles and that as result the political impetus for bulgarian independence came primarily from russian expansionism and concomitant military and political support for slavic nationalist movements was the reciprocal population transfer in bulgaria also motivated by russian desires for more homogeneously slavic and orthodox christian client state so as to more effectively exert influence remember being confused during the course about why ethnic tensions suddenly flared up in the ottoman empire during this time period and why such extreme episodes of ethnic cleansing were suddenly acceptable to people who only centuries or decades before had seemingly very little to no sense of ethnic identity much less nationalism only recently did it occur to me that the sudden development of such us vs them mentalities could have been provoked by the existential threat the expansion of the russian empire posed to the ottomans at the time the dream of the former being to capture istanbul constantinople and justify their claim of being the second byzantium of course russian expansion at the expense of the ottomans had been nothing new with the crimean khanate being lost and the establishment of russian black sea fleet already occurring as early as the 18th century think but only during the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the russians really on the cusp of conquering istanbul and anatolia itself with the only force preventing this from occurring being the interventions of the british although there was also the time when the egyptian province almost conquered istanbul advancing all the way into anatolia and forcing the sultan to beg the russians to intervene since the british refused so at the point the russians probably could have taken istanbul under the guise of protecting it from the egyptians but stopped short of doing so for unclear reasons only recently did it occur to me that there might be connection between all of this and the russian war in the caucasus and the subsequent ethnic cleansing of the circassians prompting me to ask this question

34248 the treaty of between the united states and britain said that the boundary separating quebec from the states of vermont and new york was to be at the 45th parallel of north latitude the state of new york adamantly insisted that vermont was part of new york and thus this line put vermont within the although vermonts government at the time took the position that it was not part of the but in light of later events in and that need not concern us here but google maps shows some locations along the boundary more than quarter mile north of the 45th parallel and some as much as half mile north of there think the haskell free library and opera house deliberately constructed to have the international boundary passing through the building is something like half mile north of the 45th parallel am not simply trusting google maps rather looked at locations of official border crossings and at the haskell free library surmise that the discrepancy resulted from the inability of 18th century land surveyors to be more precise than that but my question is did later treaties ratify the details of 18th century measurement errors what are the specifics of those later agreements were they between the and britain or between the and canada or some of each here do not have in mind the agreement rectifying the mistakes in concerning the relative locations of the lake of the woods and the mississippi river thats quite different story

34552 the mongol empire rapidly expanded to become the largest land empire in history but then it disintegrated just as rapidly what caused this so rapid demise of the worlds largest pre british empire
34574 in the late medieval renaissance period the concept of the greek phalanx reappeared in the shape of the pike square but while the maniple system was by no means straight counter of the phalanx the romans managed to defeat it and conquer greece so in an europe studying the classics and the spiritual successor of the phalanx proving its effectiveness did anyone try to adapt the roman tactics
34597 in the april issue of harper magazine dan baum writes about interviewing john ehrlichman at the time was writing book about the politics of drug prohibition started to ask ehrlichman series of earnest wonky questions that he impatiently waved away you want to know what this was really all about he asked with the bluntness of man who after public disgrace and stretch in federal prison had little left to protect the nixon campaign in and the nixon white house after that had two enemies the antiwar left and black people you understand what saying we knew we couldn make it illegal to be either against the war or black but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily we could disrupt those communities we could arrest their leaders raid their homes break up their meetings and vilify them night after night on the evening news did we know we were lying about the drugs of course we did and later in the same piece nixon invention of the war on drugs as political tool was cynical but every president since democrat and republican alike has found it equally useful for one reason or another meanwhile the growing cost of the drug war is now impossible to ignore billions of dollars wasted bloodshed in latin america and on the streets of our own cities and millions of lives destroyed by draconian punishment that doesn end at the prison gate one of every eight black men has been disenfranchised because of felony conviction my question is is there evidence to suggest the war on drugs was cover for class warfare
34618 the ancient legislation know about do not have any concept of rape but of adultery married and virgin not virgin the monotheist religious texts condemn rape as adultery outside the wedding and allow it inside the wedding in this system the victim of rape is condemned for adultery unless she screams really hard and lots of people hear her see the bible if man rapes another man both are condemned for adultery and homosexuality these rules were applied for quite while in lot of places the laws of the roman empire before it became christian did forbid sex with unmarried women but allowed adultery with married women so rape on married woman was not criminalized homosexuality not being forbidden rape on man would not be condemned either hence my question when and where was it first criminalised independently from adultery virginity stealing there seems to be kind of shame factor on this which is understandable side note am so happy to live in the st century
34657 im reading orlando figes revolutionary russia prince mirsky was appointed minister for the interior by tsar nicholas and was much more progressive than his predecessor he convened congress of middle class liberals and they drafted some proposals for reform to present to nicholas including the suggestion of an advisory parliamentary body nicholas rejected this proposal on the grounds that it undermined his god given right to rule over the people after this rejection mirsky said everything has failed let us build jails what did he mean by this
34809 today the word fascist is used by many people as not much more than swear word due to how world war unfolded however what precise meaning did it carry when used to describe person in the 1930s in novel written and set in the 1930s the main character is tourist on trip in italy misses train gets lost and enjoys this experience so much that he intentionally avoids being found for several weeks two times is the word fascist used in the novel once young fascist asks him for light for his cigarette and another time fascist is described to stop him at train station says he recognized him from the newspapers as the lost foreign tourist and says his wife is looking for him the main character quickly scribbles telegraph message to tell his family he is all right gives this message with some money to cover the telegraph fee and the fascist lets him go and fulfills the task of bringing the telegraph to the post office what kind of person did this word describe was it like job description if so what did they do from the novel it seemed to be like kind of detective or policeman but he didnt detain or question the lost person if not then what else could it mean as fascism was the current political system in italy at that time what information could this word carry would it be similar to call some random person in the soviet union communist or random person in democratic country democrat not in the usa where it is more specific to political party otherwise what political activist how would he then be recognized as such in train station and what kind of information or description would the author want to deliver with it the novel itself doesnt seem to carry any kind of political message or sociological commentary it simply focuses on the private life of few people without any focus on the political landscape of the era wish to simply know what kind of person should imagine this character as
34877 according to every source that found so far the only reason mary surratt was convicted of taking part in the assassination of abraham lincoln was that the murder conspiracy was plotted in her boarding house what other reasons were given for the conviction and execution of mary surratt the first woman ever executed by the united states it would seem that owning the boardinghouse in which john wilkes booth lived was not enough reason to convict mrs surratt to death see images especially since she insisted on her to innocence to the end
34889 in victor hugos the hunchback of notre dame clopin trouillefou uses scythe to great effect one was noticed who had large glittering scythe and who for long time mowed the legs of the horses he was frightful he was singing ditty with nasal intonation he swung and drew back his scythe incessantly at every blow he traced around him great circle of severed limbs he advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry with the tranquil slowness the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of harvester attacking field of wheat my question is has scythe ever been used in such fashion historically aware that war scythes have their blades mounted parallel with the shaft and this is not what am looking for has scythe in its traditional arrangement been used in warfare edit am looking specifically for examples from the middle ages or later
34911 during worldbuilding for roleplaying campaign realized that have reasonable idea of what people have been growing and eating in northern europe rye cabbage turnips beets and other roots etc but my mental picture of what ancient roman greek fields would typically yield is rather sketchy beyond barley and olives
34922 fashions come in and out and beards alternate between trendy and passe by the introduction of the safety razor shaving had obviously become so common that even the poorest farmer could afford to walk around with smooth cheeks but who was the first culture to say this stuff growing out of our faces is rubbish and what was the reason know that alexander ordered his soldiers to shave their beards but an army is not society so that doesnt really count unless the folks back home emulated this shaving
34925 by this mean has there ever been major military conflict from the time periods of ad to present disregard civil wars and weird things like say the pig war etc where if you had map made one day before the war started of the countries kingdoms empires involved that map would be the exact same as map made one day after the war ended by change mean there would be no territory lost or gained by either side no change of country state or city names also the war can not have resulted in regime change other than in democracy the king tyrant dictator or his family faction remained in power on both sides the only one that could think of is possibly the soviet afghan war but could be mistaken but are there any others
34933 about months back went to south africa did try to learn bit about the country before going there was very much surprised to learn that apartheid was thing practice till nelson mandelas release from jail in from what little could garner in my brief time is that both countries india and south africa was annexed taken over by other countries multiple times could not figure out why the two countries differed in the final outcome while india was able to become self independent state in for indians by indians south africa is still ruled by minor european people they were repeatedly annexed by both britain and holland dutch successively over centuries the strategies employed by both countries are similar we indians used mix of non violent passive resistance gandhiji and the gandhian movement and violent resistance subhash chandra bose bhagat singh chandrashekhar azad and many others for south africans they had nelson mandela and im sure there were people who took violence as way to gain independence what differences or factors could be attributed for the way history became in the two countries
34962 know that there are many cases of cultures having whacky ideas of how exactly babies are made however in most of these cases they still link the creation of babies to having sex however weird the link may be my question is the following is there any strong evidence of historical or current cultures in which the link between sex and the creation of babies was not understood in the slightest if not would accept an answer that comes the closest thank you apologize if this is the wrong stack exchange tried looking for what deemed the most fitting
34985 what were the reasons that the government selected hiroshima to be the city in japan on which the first atomic bomb was dropped other than the obvious reason that hiroshima was large important port of japan what mean is what set hiroshima and later nagasaki apart from other important japanese cities making these two cities those selected for the atom bomb could the reason have something to do with the citys location near the coast in southern japan their industries or some other factor such as perhaps the location of important government offices there although did extensive research on this subject the only reason found for this was that on the morning scheduled for the bombing hiroshima had no cloud cover letting the bomber enola gay aim the bomb carefully however this is short term reason and im looking for longer term reasons
35081 the netherlands attacked venezuela in which resulted in the overthrow of venezuelan president cipriano castro according to the new york times article dutch at war with venezuela the dutch said that attack was reprisal against castros government which refuses to give satisfaction for his unfriendly acts toward holland but did not explain what the unfriendly acts were wikipedias dutch venezuelan crisis of has slighly more details dispute broke out on the grounds of the harbouring of jewish refugees from coro in cura ao but did not give references or citations on this statement and did not explain who was harbouring the refugees what they had to do with venezuela and the netherlands and how this led to an attack and overthrow of foreign government
35123 have scoured the internet for numerical figures and an actual list of raw materials to no avail moreover am reasonably certain that many of you are very knowledgeable upon this subject matter and are more than able to inform me would greatly appreciate this in addition it would be very nice if anyone could recommend any archive database or book that may help me in my research thanks once again
35185 im not student of history so apologize for lack of correct year but had heard this on documentary it was early as the early 40s that roosevelt churchill met to form the atlantic charter and decided they would accept nothing but unconditional surrender the documentary talked about the war at stalingrad that hitler or his aides were thinking about communicating to the russians of possible surrender but realized that was impossible because of the meeting that roosevelt had now am no sympathizer nor skin and agree that hindsight that was the best option but im not sure it was really fair to do so that early without knowledge of camps many people argue that churchill just hated germany and it kind of makes sense what are some of the facts that lead to the decision
35248 mein kampf was illegal in lot of countries for very long time yet while browsing goodreads realised reading it might be very interesting to get some insight in how the horrors of ww2 came to be noticed the year of publishing on said list was with hitler demise being in that seemed rather difficult to believe so am assuming the book has been modified edited there were quite few earlier translations so am positive it is not simply the year the translated version was released so how likely is it that the book has been censored if government decides to illegalize it publishing it with changed contents does not sound very far fetched
35275 im wondering if any leader from any era said the phrase we may have lost the battle but not the war that can be backed up with reputable sources the meaning of the phrase by my interpretation is youve have few failures recently but theres lot more to go so focus on winning the next opportunities but this can be taken literally too im not asking for the origin of the phrase but rather if it was used by any leaders to maybe boost morale of their troops after seeing half their army dead most injured woman and children taken villages on fire etc
35337 the aeolipile was simple mechanical device that generated kinetic energy from steam its invention is attributed to the hero of alexandria in the 1st century ad source aeolipile with the benefit of hindsight the leap from that machine to using kinetic energy to generate motion or operate machinery seems logical yet as far as can tell it wasnt made until the 17th century when steam power would first be used to do meaningful work what technological and if present cultural factors prevented further growth in the use of steam power in 1st century roman egypt or any other region during classical antiquity
35392 im costuming show that takes place in the 17th century paris cavalier period as far as costumes go cant seem to find conclusive answer regarding whether the gentlemen need to have scabbard or whether sword belt alone will do it seems as though man be injured carrying sword without scabbard but im finding most belt frogs come without them any help would be greatly appreciated
35506 kamikaze you know the crash plane into boat thing is for japanese learners like myself initially very confusing word in japanese its meaning god gods divinity etc and means wind or things related to wind it can also mean style but thats not important thus you get or divine wind referring to the two typhoons that twice saved japan from mongol invasion the japanese saw america and friends as invaders despite japan having attacked first and thus the kamikaze pilots saw themselves as performing an act symbolically similar to the aforementioned typhoons that said its not called in japanese its called or tokk special attack with squad of pilots being called or tokk tai special attack squad so ya why exactly did the more english speaking ally powers pick up kamikaze as loanword rather then tokko when thats what it was actually called
35525 my impression was that members of the actual nazi party were able to use their influence to get out of the most dangerous assignments is this accurate how many of the front line infantry and officers were actually members of the party

35638 greenland was known to europe since long before in fact lief erikson reached modern canadian lands around the year coming from greenland that journey was forgotten but he chose logical exploration path by starting from the west most land known so why didnt columbus do the same seems much bigger leap to try the mid atlantic first surely they knew via dead reckoning and the like the greenland coasts were much more west than portugal in the summer and fall the ocean around south greenland should be ice free enough to navigate in fact in the year portugal sent someone to greenland to find northwest passage to asia why didnt they do this first with columbus
35645 gutenberg certainly had great impact on the availability of books but his printing press didnt help bring books into the hands of the poor the price of books dropped from thousands of days worth of wages to hundreds but this was still far too expensive for commoners by the 17th century many commoners in europe could read but they probably had nothing more to read than the bible which would guess was sponsored or at least heavily subsidized to make it affordable the poor still couldnt afford to just go to bookstore and buy any book they fancied compare it with the 20th century and onward when books can be bought with pocket change when did books first become affordable to the poor this means that even low income families could afford if they wanted to own several books without significant financial sacrifices in the early to mid 19th century there were already popular authors in europe who wrote for the tastes of the poorer classes so would guess it was around that time but can this guess be improved upon
35681 im listening to james scotts the war below in world war ii us navy torpedoes detonated at the end of their range if they hadnt hit anything so if torpedo was fired and went its maximum range 4500y for the mark without otherwise detonating it would self detonate im curious why that is advantageous wouldnt it make more sense for missed shot to be allowed to silently sink to the bottom id think there would be many tactical situations where commander would prefer that if his shots missed the enemy remained unaware until he could shoot again there are numerous scenes in the book where commanders hear detonations that are long after the calculations showed they should have exploded if theyd hit etc so it was apparently standard to be clear im not talking about any of the malfunctions or problems the us navy had with its torpedoes in wwii the torpedoes of that era were designed to explode at end of run few related questions was that true only of the us navy or did the torpedoes of the germans japanese etc behave the same way when the usn switched from steam powered to electric powered torpedoes was this design carried forward do torpedoes still behave that way realize nowadays they seek their own targets in some cases but what if torpedo is fired and runs out of power self detonate or sink to the bottom
35720 the fortifications of copenhagen fredericia and acre are star shaped defense of copenhagen is shown in the picture below why not have defenses or fortifications in the shape of pure square or circle
35769 the bow was relatively common weapon on dark age battlefields as harolds arrow in the eye at hastings will attest but shortly after is was largely superseded by the crossbow partly because pretty much any man at arms could pick up and shoot crossbow with zero training yet the bow didnt go away it proved an effective weapon in the hands of the welsh when they fought against english invaders in the early middle ages so effective in fact that edward recruited bodies of welsh bowmen into his armies they proved decisive at the battle of falkirk however it seems unclear as to what kind of bow the welsh archers were using was it the same as the longbow so feared by the french in the hundred years war or was it more of common hunting bow and was it this bow in use during falkirk that then evolved into the longbow later and why was there not an equivalent evolution in other european countries at the time most chroniclers seemed to believe the longbow was the superior weapon if one could find the trained archers although guess this may be english bias england got itself those archers by dint of the famed royal proclamation that all able bodied men should practice the bow on every holiday why then were there not equivalent proclamations elsewhere
35824 the green and yellow on the brazilian flag are references to the houses of bragan and lorraine of francis and ii of the house of habsburg lorraine respectively it seems that the diamond shape on the flag of the empire of brazil which like the background green and yellow still remain in the present flag of the country is reference to napoleon in the book brasil uma biografia brazil biography of lilia schwarcz and heloisa starling they say that the diamond shape in the flag was stubborn tribute to napoleon made by dom pedro of brazil the flag was made by jean baptiste debret french artist that worked for napoleon and went to brazil after the fall of napoleon even though the book says the reference was made by the emperor by citing the background of the creator of the flag want to show that this reference isnt far fetched at all the tribute to napoleon in the flag of the empire was made probably because of the relocation of the portuguese royal family to brazil which was caused because napoleon invaded portugal hence napoleon was the reason why dom pedro of brazil was in brazil in the first place having to declare independence cant see any other reason for tribute as curiosity regarding the independence portugal wanted to undermine the political power brazil got after it was elevated to part of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and algarves rather than colony of portugal and brazilians didnt accept it so they pressed dom pedro to declare independence if im not wrong to avoid political instability actually if you think about it it was only because of the monarchy that brazil stayed together and didnt split into tiny republics like it was the case with our not so tiny neighbours question remains in what way is diamond shape reference to napoleon
35884 in this question one answer states that the soviets baltic fleet was stuck in the gulf of finland due to an anti submarine net and mines but the mediterranean has plenty of narrow gulfs and straits and yet the allies were able to sail around doing naval invasions what about the axis operations in the gulf of finland made it impossible for the baltic fleet to break through
35945 in linguistics we have concept known as language relativism its the idea that since languages change with time and that they can share features with each other the borders between them can be quite fuzzy with two people who speak the same language merely having very fuzzy border between their personal languages with dialects merely making these borders more noticeable this concept sees languages like nations defined more by agreement and consensus then by any real set of defining characteristics its why dialects arent languages since non dialectals can still understand them and why even if you dont speak japanese you could still understand words like konnichiwa or arigatou in way that feels like english if you want to see linguistic relativism at work watch this video on scots any who let us focus on ancient europe and the various degrees of ngles the peasants probably spoke in learning linguistics were taught how people in medieval europe often lived in villages and would rarely stray far from their community thus people developed accents and dialects ones much heaver then the those today imagine if every dialect was deep scottish one due to the relative nature of language speakers could often speak to neighbouring communities with nearby communities having more communication and thus more of an effect on how people spoke this resulted in people having linguistic circle of influence certain range of neighbouring tongues they could understand with these neighbouring dialects getting heavier and heavier the further they went from there community eventually reaching point at which they simply couldnt understand them anymore with these dialects having become languages from their point of view how would this have played into life back then if communal languages made it so that kingdom could contain countless communal languages each linked in terms of who could understand who in my classes we learned this stuff as its really good example of relativism at work but we never really explored the history it brought thus im simply very curious as to what this would have done to medieval life did armies have to deal with this variability in understanding did tax collectors and town criers need to be communally picked how much is written about people back then using dialects to identify communal origin
35979 in the united states calendars that list week in one line are typically formatted like this sunday is the first day of the week and saturday is the seventh that conforms to tradition that goes back at least to ancient jews long before christianity if understand correctly people in europe now regard monday as the first day and sunday as the seventh the calendars are thus formatted was it during the 20th century that europeans adopted this convention additionally some african countries consider saturday the first day
36113 know that greenwich mean time was established in as an aid to navigation portuguese and spanish navigators in the 15th century also appeared to be aware of the usefulness of timekeeping for longitudinal navigation though they lacked sufficiently accurate clocks to implement the technique my question is this when was the fundamental principle discovered when did travelers first notice that if you go to the west the sun rises and sets later

36126 my question is has there been any states that have warred with each other in the united states obviously the one war that comes to mind is the civil war not what am looking for my question is more directed to one state has grievance with one other state and they collected militia to go to battle being from ohio also know of the toledo war which was political battle over the mouth of the maumee river in this tale two soon to be states took up arms to contest small swatch of land at the border of michigan and ohio ohio won of course go bucks it got me wondering had this happened anywhere else in the us where state fought state or state fought territory am looking for something disputes that dont have to do with the civil war pre or post so anything that has to do with slavery or north south aggression noting that the civil war wasnt about slavery to begin with did some looking and didnt find any internal conflicts other than above only ones that involved other countries fighting for land in the us if anyone has other examples please let me know
36144 which was the first civilization to ban existing slavery with law for example if civilization never had slavery and it makes law banning it it wont count for this purposes ive looked online but found nothing im aware of the other question about slavery this is different because this is asking which civilization actually banned slavery after having it not who was the first person to realize slavery was wrong
36164 russian colonism of the pacific rim included religious missions which sought to perform baptisms as an incentive to conversion baptized native men were exempted from imperial fur tax they then had to tithe to the church but this may have been relatively advantageous position as women never had to pay fur tax they must have had other motivations for converting to orthodox christianity what were those

36212 the zimmerman telegram was diplomatic message from officials in germany to the mexican president sent in after being intercepted and decoded by britains intelligence community its contents were found to be an offer of monetary compensation retaking of previously held lands and strategic alliance between germany and mexico in exchange for mexicos military aid in the first world war should american involvement become inevitable after the contents of the letter became public and sparked outrage german foreign secretary arthur zimmerman publicly confirmed the authenticity of the message further sparking controversy and ultimately cementing americas already fairly definitive alignment against germany for the duration of the war why would germany publicly acknowledge the contents of the letter though denial of the letters contents or authenticity possibly mixed with an accusation that the uk had forged it in its own interests may have created hesitation and confusion among americas military brass which couldve given germany an advantage during the rest of the war
36221 somalia was created in by joining two regions british somaliland and italian somaliland references in wikipedia keep toggling between british somaliland and italian somalia note the use of somalia for one and somaliland for the other found text from the movie breakfast at tiffanys from where they mention and its not bounded in the west by tulip texas or in the east by somali land its wherever you go this makes me wonder what was the canonical naming to the region when was somalia first used would people use somaliland alone to call british somaliland also was somaliland also the name for the geographical region independently of the political borders
36246 after watching the last episode of the anime chaos child and possibly other people come into question who was woodburn heron his research is quoted in the anime but when you search on google you can only find his article the pathology of boredom and other articles in collaboration with donald hebb nothing in specific related to the person itself when read the article cited above understood the quote done by the anime the research about sensorial restriction but who was that guy what more he studied his is importance so small why would the chaos child authors quote it then ask in the hope that someone who has studied psychology and related more academically has come up with some information about it someday and can share it with us something that books lost in some specific library didnt find anything in the public library of my city not that had any hope of finding it in that probably have but the internet has not yet

36342 in another question when was the last cavalry charge answers discussed several occasions where horses were still used in combat including in cavalry charges thought that the invention of the machine gun had made that tactic obsolete yet many armies including the army maintained some horse mounted cavalry leading into the war today cavalry units use helicopters or tanks to achieve the same effect my question is under what tactical situations during world war ii were horse mounted cavalry units still effective if the opposing side included armor or multiple machine gun teams would that have discouraged commanders from employing the horse mounted troops
37404 during antiquity there were multiple greek colonies in todays egypt later alexander the great conquered these territories and then the ptolemaic kingdom was established some of todays egypt was also part of the roman empires for long period so id assume greek was spoken at that period as well what happened to the greek language in egypt after that why hasnt it survived to our days
37414 was not really sure how to phrase this question but ok let me try nonetheless my background is in natural sciences but have always been interested in history as well over past years have also been reading some of the authors like diamond tainter huntington fukuyama and recently also turchin based on this literature formed some mixed views on this works above and what they teach us about dynamical processes in the history of human societies quite liked the approach taken by turchin but then again should be aware of my potential biases based on that would be interested in knowing more about is there uniform academic fields of research that these authors could be categorized in or are most of these individual disjointed approaches in what seem as related subjects are there specialized papers articles journals for this kind of fields topics are there regular conferences debates meetings organized on the subject what is the current stage of using approaches like the study of dynamical systems in the broadest sense in the modeling of historical processes are there groups and departments at the universities and institutes that use math modeling and computational sciences to study topics in history or sociology for that matter like turchin are there some mainstream views in the fields on these subjects of dynamical approaches to study history or is the bulk of the discussion still at level of questioning the feasibility of these concepts was hoping to get bit wider perspective on the subject here so would quite appreciate any comments views reading suggestions do not want to imply that the list of authors is in any way representative it is rather my personal random cross section of the matter edit bibliography diamond guns germs and steel collapse tainter the collapse of complex societies huntington clash of civilizations fukuyama the origins of political order political order and political decay turchin historical dynamics war and peace and war secular cycles

37420 ive read several claims that churchill ordered the destruction of the bombe code breaking machines but dont really understand the motivation for it can you explain it to me or give reference if you as nation have the capability to decode communications then why give that up this is independent of whether or not the enigma machines were destroyed that ability should if nothing else discourage others from even trying or at least give head start in case someone did try to use encrypted communications it seems to me this signals desire to be less threatening but dont feel this fits into the vibe of the times and in any case is based solely on my own exceedingly amateur speculation

37551 after the us civil war when slavery was kinda ended is there argument to be made that with the zeal of anti slavery social change people must have been feeling that they at least in the north would have been more willing to embrace further social changes for black people riding the momentum of the large civil war level changes that were happening ask this as you often see movements for large social changes like in the 60s and maybe even now ether fizzle away soon after success or march on demanding more the best example of this social march is in my opinion the french revolution it was mess but you cant say it wasnt also histories greatest example of this kind of marching social liberalism so ya was the post civil war treatment of blacks where they were free but not accepted in the north an example of wave of social liberalism fizzling or were there other forces at play that could explain why more progress wasnt pursued after the civil war
37591 the venezuelan crisis of was naval blockade from december to february imposed against venezuela by britain germany and italy over president cipriano castros refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by european citizens in the venezuelan civil war the most famous depiction of the crisis were featured in the newspaper le petit parisien my eyes caught the sight of the russian flag couldnt find any information about this strange detail could someone please shed light on this thank you
37656 was reading up on siege of vienna saw rather curious image with camels in it for full resolution image click here was surprised to see ottoman empire using camels in the unfavorable european terrain where the camels were entirely unsuitable for operations the wiki article confirms usage of camels in the campaign many large calibre cannons and artillery pieces became hopelessly mired or bogged down leaving suleiman no choice but to abandon them while camels brought from the empires eastern provinces unused to the difficult conditions were lost in large numbers sickness and poor health became common among the janissaries claiming many lives along the perilous journey so not only does this prove that camels were indeed used in the campaign but also that the results were disastrous so thought maybe ottomans learnt the lessons from this campaign but was surprised to see that camels were again used in the siege of vienna this is attested by testimony of king john sobieski of poland in the aftermath of the battle ours are treasures unheard of tents sheep cattle and no small number of camels it is victory as nobody ever knew before the enemy now completely ruined everything lost for them they must run for their sheer lives general starhemberg hugged and kissed me and called me his saviour it is also attested by archaeological finds of remains of 17th century camels in vienna why did ottomans use camels again when they had been proven to be unsuitable to european theaters in regards to both climate and terrain in the first attempt to take vienna can come up with the following explanations am mistakenly judging effectiveness of camels by one campaign they may have been effective normally hence leading to ottoman reliance upon them ottomans had no other or not enough alternative beasts of burden to replace camels or perhaps preferred the alternatives such as horses to be used by their cavalry ottomans simply didnt learn any lessons from campaign

37829 judson mitchells article the brezhnev doctrine and communist ideology uses the term class basis of law im not sure but think because this concept almost always appears hand in hand with duality of systems because camps class basis of law means law has different meanings content under different classes as in the dominant class in the system in capitalism this would be the bourgeoise in the article it mentioned under some soviet ideological theory bourgeoise law represented the norms of dying class while socialist law was the manifestation of the underlying laws of history which contained existential rather than normative judgements but im not sure if im right even if am im not really getting the stuff im saying edit here is some of the text of the linked article which speaks of the class basis of law kovalevs pravda argument in support of soviet intervention in czechoslovakia was organized around four basic concepts the class basis of law kovalev argued charges that the sovereignty of czechoslovakia had been violated were based upon an abstract classless approach to questions of sovereignty and self determination in class society there is no such thing as nonclass law and legal norms must be subordinated to the laws of class struggle and social development to emphasize legalistic considerations at the expense of the socialist viewpoint is to use bourgeois law as measuring stick
37869 during the gulf war there were lot of lopsided tank battles where such large number of iraqi vehicles got destroyed for very little coalition losses for example in the battle of norfolk about iraqi tanks were destroyed against coalition tanks destroyed according to wikipedia before you answer the americans and the british had better training and tactics or other high level explanation my question is more about how it physically happened have hard time imagining battle with almost thousand tanks on each side where one side just destroyed the other with such impunity did the iraqis get completely destroyed without having chance of firing back or did they fire back but it did not really hurt the coalition forces neither are easy to imagine when they had almost tanks in one place
37881 spanish colonies in the californias created in part to forestall russian expansion were militarily weak the military had only few hundred men in the whole territory and no ships at all it was easily outgunned by the two insurgent ships that sacked and burned the capital monterey in spain had always had too much going on to invest in developing california enter russia it had been expanding eastwards by conquering local societies as it went once the empire reached the pacific ocean the russian american company was formally permitted to settle alaska it established colonies there which were perennially short of food contributing to their eventual sale to the united states spanish officials took fright and monitored russian encroachment but were unable or unwilling to oppose the installation of russias outpost fort ross after the napoleonic wars ended russia sponsored several dozen long range voyages officials of the imperial navy on round the world trips and russian american company ships from sitka both made contacts throughout california several of the russian visitors who wrote up their experiences noticed the provinces inadequate defenses some especially dmitry zavalishin suggested that russia should acquire california the russian american company could not have sponsored an invasion nor settlement of california but the imperial russian navy could have this acquisition could have solved the problem of provisionment to the russian pacific rim and dramatically expanded russias sphere of influence spain would not have found out for many months and would have had trouble retaliating since three viceroyalties were in revolution at once including the one from which any reinforcements for california would have to be sent for all its vaunted navy could do spain was about to lose nearly all its colonies russia was not independent mexico wasnt about to be able to defend california either there wasnt much of fight when the united states sent few ships to take over aware of zavalishins advocacy and already possessing one outpost in the area tsars alexander and nicholas could have taken california for russia between approximately why didnt they
37882 ive just finished doris kearns goodwins team of rivals the presentation of the book suggested that the southern states seceded as response to lincolns election am confused by that timing lincoln seemed to have very moderate anti slavery position he was staunchly opposed to the expansion of slavery to new states but even years later did not believe that slavery could be interfered with in states where it was established except as war power or unless there was constitutional amendment was the timing of secession and lincolns election coincidence were the states reacting to lincoln as person or just to the election of republican if they were reacting to lincoln as person what was it about him that provoked them
37905 for instance aircraft production rose from thousand in to thousand in while tank production approximately doubled over that span according to paul kennedys rise and fall of the great powers yet many weapons in the latter year werent properly deployed because of lack of fuel was wondering whether germanys war effort might have been better served by producing fewer weapons and using the fuel savings to deploy them better but perhaps that isnt the right question so the question is how did the fuel expenditure needed to produce tank or airplane compare to its fuel usage over the course of say year know that albert speers mass production techniques had lot to do with the productivity increase so could the allocation of resources to production as opposed to use had something to do with hitlers greater trust of speer than his generals

38151 im curious to what degree rome of the late republic was fed by imports as opposed to local goods rome in this case meaning the city and the italian peninsula as opposed to her client states and various holdings ive read several times that egypt was the breadbasket of the roman republic but ive also heard that the romans exported cereals to the greater mediterranean so could the people of the italian peninsula support themselves agriculturally or was the population reliant on plunder tribute and foreign trade if so what were the major sources of roman food imports thanks for your time

38167 ive read that the during the late roman republic and early empire there was great migration from country to urban living historians estimate in peninsular italy of the population lived in city thats staggering number especially when you consider both the notoriously deadly living conditions that existed in roman tenements and the very real threat of civil war or military purge and yet as the link above notes is the kind of number that id normally associate with early industrialization what you see when automation begins disrupting traditional modes of production and factory jobs start luring agricultural workers into urban life but of course the romans didnt have factories to make factory jobs in so my question is what were all these people doing once they got to rome was there employment waiting for them and of what kind what kinds of employment and economic infrastructure supported the roman urban poor and what working conditions did they face

38347 the book raven rock the story of the governments secret plan to save itself while the rest of us die by garret graff contains the following passage when wilson left america for the paris peace conference an absence that would stretch for months senator lawrence yates sherman introduced resolution to declare wilson absent from office and install vice president thomas marshall as the acting president until wilson returned to shores it is palpable violation of the act of approved by george washington to attempt to exercise the constitutional sovereign powers of the president within the domain of another government sherman had thundered saying the president of the united states is not its president in france he is an alien there mere citizen of the republic shorn of all his sovereign powers have found references to senator sherman opposing the versailles treaty and to an attempt to install thomas marshall as acting president after wilsons stroke but cannot find the aforementioned resolution an act passed in that seems relevant or another source for that quote in short find this story highly dubious could anyone confirm or debunk this story

38402 by pure chance found out there was plan red for the event of war between the states and britain the plan was conceived in the late 20s and early 30s of the previous century it seems the article makes no mention of the expected reasons for such war initially assumed it was customary to plan for the event of war with any serious rival particularly since there were series of colour plans for various war theatres but the plan was classified until which seems to indicate it was not expected there would be such plan so did the united states expect war against britain and why wikipedia further states the following which dont know how to assess but which seems important war plan red was developed by the united states army following the geneva naval conference and approved in may by secretary of war patrick hurley and secretary of navy charles francis adams iii and updated in it was not presented for presidential or congressional approval only the united states congress has the power to declare war

38664 according to official census data soviet union had around million people in and around million in annexation of baltic states and part of poland germany third reich had around million but after operation barbarossa started soviet union lost huge part of its territory including major cities like kiev minks smolensk etc therefore population available for conscription and any kind of mobilizationwork in industry agriculture etc was reduced what was effective available population in various stages of war im especially interested in december and october because germans held biggest swaths of soviet territory at that time demographics of the soviet union census in germany
38679 on wikipedia it is stated that earlier hitlers foreign policy worked to weaken ties between poland and france and attempted to manoeuvre poland into the anti comintern pact forming cooperative front against the soviet union poland would be granted territory to its northeast in ukraine and belarus if it agreed to wage war against the soviet union but the concessions the poles were expected to make meant that their homeland would become largely dependent on germany functioning as little more than client state the poles feared that their independence would eventually be threatened altogether but cant find the exact demands the nazis had during this period am assuming that the demands were return of the city of danzig and east prussian territories this would have effectively turned poland into landlocked country and dependent on germany for naval passage and transit port unless the poles succeeded in getting the germans to carve them corridor through ukraine all the way to the black sea but that doesnt explain why poland thought it would threaten their independence there are many landlocked countries who are independent if poles didnt trust germans with transit pact they could have made similar one with lithuania or latvia poland tried to restore ties with lithuania but soviet union had warned the baltic states to not to get too friendly with poland both of whom had naval access and shared borders with poland occupation of baltic states by soviet union hadnt occurred at that time or could it be that they were concerned that without maritime access to the baltic sea in event of german invasion french and british expeditionary forces would face troubles in landing to relieve poland although doubt allies would have done that they could always open western front on french german border which eventually they did are the exact demands known

38764 in joan oates book babylon particularly the part about sargon and his successors it is said that sargons son rimush was killed in palace conspiracy possibly with the participation of his brother manishtushu the author says that this name meaning who is with him perhaps indicated that they were twins this made me think about twins in general and how they seem pretty rare among prominent historical figures some sources say that the likelihood of having twins is while others seem to indicate that the number might be in non developed countries as there seems to be lot of fluctuation will use as the real chance with this number we should expect to find at least some twins in history as there are more than known historical figures but this doesnt seem to be the case quick google and wikipedia search didnt give me any results cant seem to find historical figures with twins even non famous twins unless include mythological twins in my search in this case there are the pairs romulus and remus and apollo and artemis as am interested in people that really existed though these pairs dont answer my question also as dont want this question closed will divide it into two sub questions the first straightforward one the second question that might generate some debate which is not the objective here if this is considered violation of this websites rules feel free to edit out the second question can someone remember any historical figure with twin besides rimush and manishtushu on which there still seems to be an ongoing debate why is this the case why are twins so rare among historical figures revised edition meaning people having to do with political history

38814 after living in usa for over some years have come to notice that swedish women are at times portrayed like sexually free wheeling or liberated as persons for who willingly go without clothes in public areas and so on sort of like in this picture from an episode of simpsons now am not sure if this stereotype applies also to swedish men or if its origin is not so much people of certain nationality but perhaps people or women in particular that are blond haired and blue eyed am saying this because past work colleague who had grown up in america but was originally from vietnam told me that he ended up marrying white woman partially because he was affected by the feminine ideals portrayed in usa what is the origin of the american stereotypes about swedish women

38881 yuri semyonovs the conquest of siberia says the main motivation for the russian empires eastwards expansion was the acquisition of furs in the form of yasak the fur tax assessed on native male subjects geopolitics was relatively minor concern no other power was rapidly expanding towards russian territory and the imperial military was in any case often occupied with wars in europe of course the empire also had state religion the orthodox church which midway through the era of expansion suffered schism did it provide doctrinal justification for the conquest could it afford to missionize the new territory did the creation of siberian dioceses such as the bishopric of irkutsk change church politics

38903 july is the date that the declaration of independence was ratified why was that the date chosen for independence day rather than any of these dates not to the exclusion of others these just seem equally or more plausible than july july when the americans voted unanimously on the declaration it is noteworthy that john adams predicted this date rather than the fourth as being the most important day on the calendar october the surrender at yorktown unofficially concluding the revolutionary war january when the treaty of paris was ratified september when the treaty of paris was officially concluded also officially concluding the revolutionary war november when the last british soldiers pulled out from the us so why pick on july when there are so many other dates they could have chosen all facts are from here and here
38943 ive always wondered how an infantry soldier without pike which cavalry wouldnt charge into normally deliver fatal blow to cataphract what know is that cataphracts were used as heavy shock troops that were used to break enemy lines after they smash into any unit some sort of hand to hand fighting would take place what want to know is how during that fight cataphract knight could be killed in other words how would an infantry soldier overcome difference in height weapon reach and maximal armor with little holes and deliver fatal blow there are many forms of armor for cataphracts across history but they all were very heavily armored persian sassanian cataphracts riders heads were even entirely armored cant imagine swordsman or spear man being able to deliver fatal blow when faced with such fearsome opponent any idea or historical evidence of how very heavy cavalry were defeated edit during the course of history many battles took place where armies composed contained cataphracts were defeated such as in the battle of tigranocerta small inferior roman force defeated an armenian force with some cataphracts by flanking them and attacking their rear in the battle of yarmouk the brilliant khalid managed to beat the byzantine cavalry with his much lighter cavalry again by superior tactics he managed to beat persian armies that had heavy cavalry too at many other occasions alexander crushed the persians granicus issus and gaugamela with their superior heavy cavalry by using clever combination his macedonian pikemen and his personal companion cavalry all the battles and sources can find states that the heavy cavalry were defeated by superior tactics and flanking however cannot find any reliable source stating the defeat of cataphract in hand to hand fight edit following the excellent answer by mynott95 was recently reading about the battle of strasbourg also known as battle of argentoratum between the western romans and the alamanni confederations it describes how the germans dealt with the heavy roman cataphracts head on the roman heavy cavalry now charged the german horsemen in the ensuing chnodomars stratagem paid dividends the interspersed foot warriors wreaked havoc bringing down the horses of the cataphracts and then killing their riders on the ground

38989 know there are drawings and paintings from witnesses depicting the sinking of rms titanic but are there any actual photographs or footage of the event happening this video claims to be footage of the titanic sinking but am inclined not to believe it because there have been many films made on the event and not just the famous one from but there were also movies made on it from and as well this footage could just be from one of those movies and the youtuber took advantage of the old looking film to fool people or perhaps he was misguided himself my question is are there any photographs or footage of the rms titanic sinking am not interested in simulations or cgi interpretations but real on sight footage of the event

39046 this is partially related to the issue that dislike of certain groups of individuals had long roots in europe such as exemplified by this article anyway was looking at this other question which asks how hitler could possibly have had his own militia already in that other question has this quotation about the munich post newspaper from this article as hitler sought to ingratiate himself with the city rulers though never giving up the threat of violence the post reporters dug into his shadowy background mocking him mercilessly exposing internal party splits revealing the existence of death squad cell that murdered political opponents and was at least as responsible for hitler success as his vaunted oratory based on above it looks like hitlers party had his own death squad well before and at least the munich post newspaper was writing about it what wanted to ask is about though are the anti jewish sentiments of hitler to what degree would his anti jewish sentiments have reasonably been known to those who voted him to power in

39275 in ancient times ships would often be at sea for extended periods of time during this time im assuming they must have done some form of cooking otherwise they would have just eaten cold pre prepared food for the whole time between stops at ports as these ships were wooden and possibly covered with tar for waterproofing how would they have cooked without risking fire in the galley from the research ive done so far ships couple hundred years ago would have had barrel bin filled with sand on which they lit their fires sailing ship provisions food and drink cant find any references for ships further back in history this is possibly because im not sure how what to search for if possible im mostly interested in egyptian and middle eastern ships

39308 background my summer reading goal is to get handle on europe from with strong focus on the british empire and within that focus on england so far ive seen multiple historians single out the crimean war as an event with major cultural political and military consequences at this point admit that feel like im starting to lose track of all those consequences which id like to bear more closely in mind as move on to the latest part of the 19th century im hoping someone more knowledgeable might be willing to give me list and summary of the major changes so can reference that going forward where relevant id also appreciate it being pointed out to me where these changes were totally contingent and where they dovetailed with broader already probable trends just so can keep the threads of causality straight the question what were the major cultural political and military consequences of the crimean war for britain and more specifically england in the latter half of the 19th century
39324 have read that generally roman men during the empire would wear only one ring at time for instance here http tribunesandtriumphs org roman clothing roman jewelry htm an unmarried one would wear seal but was there standard for which hand and which finger to wear it on it is my impression that when it was about marriage or religion they went for the fourth finger of the left hand as they believed the vena amoris term coined in the 17th century they were actually thinking of nerve was the only vessel that connected fingers to the heart for example tiberius who was after all left handed according to suetonius thus displays ring in his bronze portrait as the pontifex maximus couldnt find sources for how seal rings were worn would guess the hand depended on your left or right handedness or maybe shaking hands with the right one had implications and perhaps the finger was the index or middle one or perhaps there was no standard

39502 why are northwestern metropolitan areas cities set back from the coast everywhere in the major cities tend to sit close to coasts because this is optimal for trade major continental cities also tend to be trade hubs for other reasons rivers crossroads etc heres map made of metropolitan statistical areas msa component counties are shaded and circles represent total msa populations as you can see northwestern metropolitan counties form strip which is separated from the coast by breadth of at least one county pattern which cannot be found anywhere else in the yet seattle and portland are substantial cities comparable to other major coastal cities if not the biggest perhaps individual explanations can be found such as that seattle actually sits on the deep set puget sound and portland on the navigable willamette river still am intrigued whether there is some kind of generic explanation for this pattern no natural port on the coast or unnavigable currents or uninhabitable coast for some reason but the coast is not steep and even seems to have plenty of estuaries an intermediate explanation is that population clustered along interstate but this only pushes the question back further to why the interstate was located there in the first place
39549 germany italy russia and japan all initiated combat against peaceful countries for the clear purpose of territorial expansion of these only russia ended the war with more territory than it started with were there any other countries that did so and were successful edit guess wasnt clear enough by initiated combat was trying to say that they created war where there wasnt already one

39599 am looking for information on the general perception of the educated population in the decade leading up to ww1 would like to know to what extent tragedy of the scale of ww1 was foreseen was it shock that it happened or was it something that many saw inevitably nearing find it difficult to find information on this topic by searching the internet can find analyses about the causes of the war and discussions about whether it was inevitable but am unable to find information about how the situation was perceived at that time just to be clear am sure that there are some writings out there that seem to have predicted it but statistically there will always be few this is not what am asking about would like to know if concerns about disaster of this scale were something that came up relatively frequently in intellectual discussions of that time as they do in our time
39650 in one novel am currently reading traitorous commander who is responsible for atrocities against the people he should protect and killing the remainder of the army he once belonged to was promoted to leader again after getting captured as reason it is indicated that he is the last able commander in the army while found other novels of the series quite entertaining this is breaking the suspension of disbelief cannot think of any other action which is more damning that the person is unfit for command than betrayal in fact the usual course of action is that if the traitor is caught his former superiors show profound displeasure with the actions knowing that humans are capable of truly disturbing amounts of stupidity was there ever case that traitorous military commander took command again for the side he betrayed and the superiors knew that he is traitor because traitor is often used as polemical term rule out some at least comprehensible edge cases if the military commander acted because he reasonably feared that he was to be executed or ruined not because of misbehavior but as political sacrifice or because someone sees him as an inconvenient person dont count it also dont count it if the actions of the superiors can be reasonably counted as betrayal itself offering defended city if the own life and belongings are spared also exclude whistleblowing showing that something is profoundly wrong without personal gratification what want is really stab in the back and turn around the blade betrayal selling secrets or necessary equipment for money fall own units in the back or abandon them because it suits oneself trying to build an own empire without provocation that kind of thing
39664 was just reading fm comment on this question and history shows democratic states dont fight one another at first thought this statement was wrong but thinking further couldnt find any example of two unquestionably democratic states engagint war with eachother can only find examples of democracy declaring war to dictatorship usa invading irak in or dictatorship invading democracy for example germany invading czechoslovakia in cases of two dictatorship attacking eachother are unfortunately too common so that no example is needed the best counter example to fm claim can find is austria hungary declaring war to serbia in but both of those countries were more hybrid regimes than full democraties it seems france declaring war to prussia in is also borderline making it but both countries were kind of hybrid half democraties at this point of time
39690 im not historian although hopefully not totally ignorant of history which perhaps will prove false here am curious consumer of popular culture ever since was young have played video games watched movies and seen cartoons where major plot point is some villain kidnapping the princess wonder where this tired story trope actually originated as consider world history am unable to think of any historical instances where this actually occurred am aware of royals being taken captive as consequence of battle and then ransomed back to their families but what im not clear on was there ever any instance where the military campaign was always about actually capturing the princess not just land grab or strategic maneuver that included the happy circumstance that the conquerors happened to nab royal for ransom the plot to kidnap princess anne doesnt count because it totally failed same with the plot to rescue mary queen of scots if possible please provide specific example of historical incident in which the objective of campaign or operation was in fact the imprisonment of princess against her will that succeeded the answer that closest meets this criteria is the one im looking for bonus points if the perpetrator of the plot actually attempted to force the princess to marry him extra bonus points if this attempt succeeded
39723 why in ancient battles did being encircled mean defeat the classic example of that is the battle of cannae where roman infantry were surrounded by carthaginian infantry every description of the battle that ive seen talks in detail about how the romans came to be encircled but gives hand waving argument for why that was bad for them wikipedia and other sources say that the romans turned around and fought in circle its not like individual roman soldiers were being attacked from their unprotected sides or back another disadvantage thats cited is that they were packed too tight and didnt have room to wield their weapons presumably they are saying that the romans interlocked their shields but couldnt they rotate their shields to create the necessary gaps between them ancient battles are often described as shield wall pushing against another shield wall since the roman wall had higher density of soldiers wouldnt that let them push better giving them the ability to dictate the position of said wall expanding the circle one potential advantage of the encircled army is that its communication lines are shorter are there any examples of ancient battles where encirclement did not mean defeat that is the encircled side broke out and went on to win the battle
39748 in the recent wonder woman movie which know is not an historical essay understand that the germans are treated as the bad guys almost like nazis although am pretty sure that germans in ww1 were nothing like nazis and there were scenarios in which the usa might have supported the germans maybe groucho marx says that he supported germany in ww1 so is it possible that the history of ww1 as taught after ww2 was strongly colored by ww2 realize this is sort of meta history question
39752 this london enemies list has come up in american revolutionary war research regarding paul revere and other revolutionaries believe it is document of some sort and find referenced source picture above in david fischers book paul reveres ride written in the london enemies list seems to be compiled by tories who put names of loyalist rebels on list im not sure why it has date next to it either was there multiple versions released each year was this private list or something released in newspaper in london or america basically what is the document that says they are on this list
39774 our professor of chinese history in document you cant access without university account when talking about feudal age china before bce makes passing remark she says in ancient china the fiefs near the capital were probably given to the most trusted nobles in an other paper remember reading the exact opposite about feudal japan namely that the least trusted nobles were kept close to the capital this also ties with what read in wikipedia about the european marquess the theoretical distinction between marquess and other titles has since the middle ages faded into obscurity in times past the distinction between count and marquess was that the land of marquess called march was on the border of the country while counts land called county often was not as result of this marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbours and was thus more important and ranked higher than count given that some countries mostly suffer from internal unrest and others mostly from external enemies this is not necessarily contradiction still am fairly sure china fought external enemies far more frequently than japan thus wonder is it true that china and japan used completely opposite rationale in assigning the fiefdoms and were both well chosen for the country in question
39790 was reading crusaders cross from james lee burke when read this but airliners crash because twenty cent lightbulb burns out on the instrument panel civil war campaign is lost because confederate courier wraps three cigars in secret communique and morally demented man takes job in texas book depository and changes world history my knowledge in the history of the usa being not so great have no idea what events or historical figure he refers to but would be interested to learn about them
39811 have been trying to prove my thinking wrong believe that there can never be an occasion where ranged weapons are available in outdoor battles skirmishes that they would not be used am hoping to find case based on historical evidence where this was the case in my mind in the days of sticks and rocks cavemen would throw rocks from distance and use the stick for close combat not just wait it seems human nature and logical to try to damage the enemy as much as possible at distance unless you knew their range weapons were much better than your own also it would be good to see case where skirmish parties would not even bring along range weapons and choose to stick with melee lets say visibility might drop at times such as blizzard or sandstorm but also might be clear this would not include missions that were totally inside in caves or forest it would be anticipated that most of the mission would be on open ground from what have found ancient greeks and romans had javelins and slings and since that time ranged weapons were always employed unless your own range weapons were very inferior in which case you want to close to melee as soon as possible
39828 according to google the earliest witch trials were in the 15th century belief in magic however is obviously much older what was the churchs attitude to supposed witches prior to the 15th century what drove the change toward intolerance and persecution
39829 the roman emperor titus ran havoc in jerusalem in the first jewish roman war when not only resident jews but also lot of pilgrims from egypt and babylon were trapped in chaotic siege flavius josephus even to this day this day is mourned by jews to commemorate the emperor tituss victories most notably the siege of jerusalem the arch of titus was constructed by his brother how come this standing monument to such brutal massacre is not declared anti semitic yes know it has been used for other memories too but still the major one is of jerusalems beseiging and its still named after titus
39846 we know that the red deshret crown was used by the pharaohs of lower egypt or in occasions related only to lower egypt and the white hedjet crown was used by pharaohs of upper egypt or in occasions related only to upper egypt after the unification of egypt both crowns were merged into one and that crown was called the pschent my questions is why are some pharaohs shown wearing either crowns even after the unification of egypt example thutmose iii is depicted smiting his enemies in relief on the seventh pylon in karnak which is in upper egypt wearing the deshret crown of lower egypt at the same time still in karnak on another wall not very far from the first wall thutmose iii is shown wearing the hedjet crown how come
39850 im studying greek history and reading about the end of the bronze age and after reading about the dorians several times now im confused about where the dorians actually came from the closest can find is wikipedia saying they were from northern greece but if they were from there why would they come southward to the greek peninsula also if they came from northern greece were they of the same lineage as the minoans and mycenaeans or were they completely separate ethnic group
39861 it is my understanding that the mp40 and stg44 were successful stamped weapons used and mass produced by the germans in ww2 that gave them an advantage in some battles background stamping is simply the act of hydraulic pressing metal sheet into useful form in this case the sides of gun with the aggressive pace of innovation in the us britain to keep up with the war why didnt they produce an effective stamped weapon to counter the stamped weapons of the germans
39875 in bc thutmose iii and his army had to pass the mountains to reach megiddo he had three passes he could go through one in the north called jokneam pass and another pass in the south called dothan pass the enemy army was stationed at the end of these passes right behind the mountain so thutmose iii decided to take the third and most risky pass through the middle of the mountains called the aruna pass this route would take him through the mountains and directly to the south of megiddo itself thutmose iiis scribe said that the pass was so difficult and so tight that they had to disassemble the chariots and carry them with them and that in some areas the troops had to walk in single file in any case no matter what route thutmose iiis army took there was an empty space between where they emerged from the pass and megiddo of at most kilometres miles how come thutmose iiis army was not seen by the people in megiddo the egyptian army took hours for the last man in the army to pass the mountain did the rebels really not leave any garrison behind how did the citizens and the people inside megiddo itself not see the egyptian army knowing that megiddo is located on top of hill so they could have easily seen the army from the comfort of their homes quote from the inscriptions behold when the front had reached the exit upon this road the shadow had turned and when his majesty arrived at the south of megiddo on the bank of the brook of kina the seventh hour was turning measured by the sun then was set up the camp of his majesty and command was given to the whole army saying equip yourselves prepare your weapons for we shall advance to fight with that wretched foe in the morning so after hours for the last man in the army to go through the mountain they actually camped there how come
39879 in jules vernes around the world in eighty days the main character phileas fogg misses his train in the american north and ends up hitching ride on curious invention as described here there mr fogg examined curious vehicle kind of frame on two long beams little raised in front like the runners of sledge and upon which there was room for five or six persons high mast was fixed on the frame held firmly by metallic lashings to which was attached large brigantine sail this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist jib sail behind sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle it was in short sledge rigged like sloop during the winter when the trains are blocked by the snow these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another provided with more sails than cutter and with the wind behind them they slip over the surface of the prairies with speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains from jules vernes around the world in eighty days from sterling publishing new york picture from the golden picture classic edition tom gill illustrator did this invention actually exist or did jules verne make this vehicle up have read that authors from this era often invented strange contraptions to make the story more interesting especially if the story took place in america
39910 what was life like for an adult victorian chimney sweep im looking into my family history at the moment and my great great grandfather is listed on an census as chimney sweep thought this was child labourers profession and have never heard of an adult chimney sweep in the uk before what would life have been like for him was this an undignified profession what was chimney sweeps lifestyle like in victorian britain
39927 im looking into my ancestry and found out that my great great grandfather born in was one of fourteen children now know that even for the period this is large number of children to have but not exceedingly so therefore my question is what were the main motivations to have so many children was it lack of understanding about how conception occurs lack of contraception which doesnt really make lot of sense considering that withdrawal could still be employed or simply desire to maintain legacy
39934 havent seen the movie but know enough of the story to understand that allied troops had fallen back to dunkirk for evacuation but were trapped there until transport came also understand that the german army called off the invasion annihilation of these troops for some reason why did germany not pounce on this easy opportunity to wipe out large numbers of allied troops
39949 know this question seems bit absurd so let me preface this by saying that it stems from history based edutainment game titled marios time machine in which the main character travels back in time to various historical periods while its obviously not the most reliable source it is supposed to be an educational game and ive yet to see the game get something completely and utterly incorrect though it occasionally mixes up when certain events happened for the purposes of relaying information to the player this is an in game image of the character who claims to be the king of england without providing name as well as the relevant line of dialogue below this is the full script between the main character and the self purported king to sum up the script he is in attendance of one of michael faradays christmas lectures and he makes special note of the fact that its for juveniles indicating he is some sort of youth at the bare minimum would consider that to be someone younger than which is probably too generous he also idolizes faraday to the point where he is more interested in being scientist than the king as the player can only travel back in time to this year is certain these all seem like really specific details that would easily narrow down the kings identity but ive come up with nothing the then reigning king at the time was william iv of the united kingdom who took the throne when he was in his brothers include george iv of the united kingdom who was the previous king until he died in and ernest augustus king of hanover who was born in and thus far too old the same story goes for all of the children of george iii of the united kingdom william ivs father either they had already passed away or they were too old to apply even william ivs children would be just too old to qualify the royal family trees that ive looked at have given me no help if attacked this issue from the opposite direction and looked at any kings or heirs around this time period who were connected to michael faraday or science in general ive thrown every combination of king england science and faraday into google and hoping for the best and cannot find anything thats relevant to what im looking for let alone anything that directly answers my question ignoring the time traveling premise this game is supposed to help its players learn about history either it somehow got this fact completely wrong or it intentionally lied and both possibilities seem rather odd at this point im morbidly curious about this more so than anything else is there kernel of truth anywhere to this
39960 despite the invasions costs there were at least short term economic gains as result of plundering and the confiscation taking over of resources and factories were those benefits so evident in the longer term though were they enough to cover the cost of the occupation especially in countries such as denmark belgium and holland which had few resources other than manpower did the effects of sabotage the presumably relatively low productivity of reluctant workforce and the effects of regional later global war significantly the affect the economic viability of the occupation
40005 it seems that wasnt such big deal forty years later pope urban and emperor alexios were on such good terms that crusade was initiated to save constantinople and the holy lands even in pope innocent ii called upon emperors comnenus and lothair to unite against roger of sicily this doesnt seem much of schism only after the massacre of the latins and even more so the sack of constantinople that the two sides broke terms completely and irreversible bitterness entered the social psyche the pope and patriarch were already disagreeing on points of religion from carolingian times and was simply the latest mutual excommunication before the fourth crusade is this correct assessment
40058 searching through some wikipedia articles could only find that the city of rome itself had vigiles firefighters and policemen and only in imperial times there is no mention of detectives be them privately employed or employed by the roman state am not looking for spies but for people that helped to find culprits in assassinations or any other kind of crime was there anything resembling modern detectives in roman cities
40071 in november ship carrying three of king henry is children including his only legitimate son and heir william the atheling struck rock off the coast of northern france and sank also on board were over nobles including the kings illegitimate son richard of lincoln his niece matilda fitzroy and several key figures in henrys government the only survivor among the passengers and crew was humble butcher the repercussions of this disaster were enormous and led to almost years of civil war in england as williams sister matilda and his cousin stephen who had disembarked from the white ship shortly before it set sail fought over the throne of england there have been many maritime disasters with far greater loss of life but has there ever been one where there were so many notable people who died and where the consequences were so far reaching
40113 after the ussr gained many satellites countries in central eastern europe in russian became obligatory at school it seems those russian courses were highly unpopular and only small minority of people managed to actually get fluent in russian did the ussr send actual native russian teachers to every school to their satellite countries or did they just force local teachers to teach russian ask because in my region german language is obligatory at school but there is huge lack of german language schoolteachers and the vast majority of german teachers actually are local teachers often rather mediocre at the language themselves but they dont have choice the typical result is awful quality of german course low motivation for both the teacher and the class and as result an overall dislike of german language for schoolchildren perpetuating the problem to the next generation wonder if the situation in soviet satellite countries was analogous
40133 according to wikipedia the us radar station scr picked up the japanese approach and reported it but this report was ignored as the duty officer believed it to be american bombers coming from california it also states that scr was still in training mode so far everything is clear in this specific case but looking at the bigger picture cant find reason or reasons why despite the high level attention and the excellence of the school in training on the use of the scr and its integration and coordination with fighter intercepts the army did not follow through on supporting the junior officers who were trained at this session further wikipedia states that except in rare cases there was little interest in assisting or even cooperating with the goal of setting up the air defense system the british had already demonstrated the value of radar and shared both that knowledge and the specific technology they were using with the us aside from the tendency of some people to ignore things they dont understand which appears to have been the case with some army officers though this may be hard to prove are there any specific reasons why this high level attention was not properly followed up on
40223 when the japanese took eight pows from the doolittle raid thirty seconds over tokyo they executed three and one died of maltreatment death rate the flying tigers were an even greater thorn in the japanese side some of their 29s repeatedly bombed japanese cities long range and of course their fighters shot down hundreds of japanese planes how did the japanese treat the flying tigers that were shot down and captured over japanese territory or otherwise taken prisoner were they treated normally or were many tortured and executed
40247 it has often been said that world trade and investment between nations makes war between nations an irrational act if your trading partner is hurt it hurts your own wallet as well because you lose the profit from trade have been reminded several times that world trade will prevent world war today the world is enjoying globalisation and prosperity from global trade the globalisation before world war look similar to todays situation http www ibtimes co uk wwi 100th anniversary how global trade changed forever characteristic of the pre decades was what we would now call globalization trade may have risen from one thirtieth to one third of world production between and between and investment flows grew times europe accounted for nearly two thirds of global trade and even more of global investment and from the 1890s europe major currencies were fixed in value in relation to each other under the international gold standard hundreds of thousands of foreign born labourers worked in the heavy industries of french lorraine and germany ruhr the british writer norman angell in his best seller europe optical illusion maintained that war between advanced modern economies was now irrational why didnt global trade prevent world war
40249 ive been reading about james lind and scurvy in the royal navy and how through the efforts of lind and others survival rates improved dramatically after the introduction of orange lemon juice watercress etc into sailors rations realize this is an oversimplification pdf of course but this begs the question in the title were british port cities liverpool bristol southampton london etc and other cities that provided the bulk of the sailors to the royal navy significantly affected by this might be overstating the number of sailors in the royal navy relative to the population of these cities as whole but my naive intuition says that many more sailors actually returning to port must have had some effect
40268 so found out from post on skeptics se that when yuri gagarin landed from being the first human in space during the vostok mission he parachuted down and landed in the soviet union near the volga river on farm wikipedia recounts it like this gagarins parachute opened almost right away and about ten minutes later at ut gagarin landed both he and the spacecraft landed via parachute km mi south west of engels in the saratov region at it was km to the west of the planned landing site near baikonur farmer and her daughter observed the strange scene of figure in bright orange suit with large white helmet landing near them by parachute gagarin later recalled when they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as walked they started to back away in fear told them dont be afraid am soviet citizen like you who has descended from space and must find telephone to call moscow it think this is really cool story and want more detail did the farm where he landed have phone did they let him use it did he wait at that farm or did they give him ride into town how long did he wait there did they send taxi from saratov what did he do visualize that there was local grandma who make him big meal and he drank bit of vodka while waiting few hours for his ride or maybe he took nap at the farmers house imagine it took few days for him to return to moscow did he tell the people he met that he just got back from space and did they believe him was he rushed home and treated like hero or did they just tell him to buy bus ticket and save his restaurant receipts did anyone hassle him
40269 might have an interesting puzzle for you here this picture titled englands revenge in india appeared in nazi propaganda book against britain published in the propaganda book claims that this is photograph from published in the english newspaper picture post in note that the captions titles on the linked page are literal extracts from the book not research by the author merely translated by him from german it bears very close resemblance to this vasily vereshchagin painting from what is going on here see three possibilities the photo is genuine and the painting traces the photo the photo is staged and the painting traces the photo the painting came first and the photo is the painting with some clever pre digital photo editing however im really stumped as to which one is the answer cant find any reference to picture post photo with that title but picture post is very well known and well archived publisher the wikipedia page blowing from gun features the painting and alleges that the image is anachronistic that the british soldiers are wearing the wrong uniform for the alleged age of the incident note that the photograph has the same uniforms so if true that would indicate that either the photograph is staged or that it is an edit of the painting just to be clear im not denying any of the numerous horrific crimes of the british empire upon india im purely curious about the origins of this strange photograph
40359 the battle of leyte gulf in the philippines led to the destruction of half of what remained of the japanese navy it also sucked in all the troops that japanese could spare from elsewhere leading to their deploying about half million men in the philippines disproportionate number that could not be transferred after the japanese naval defeat so far so good with the above accomplished was it militarily possible for the americans to island hop the archipelago capture only few islands strand the remaining japanese and switch gears to larger but now less well defended targets such as the modern indonesia and indochina leaving the japanese in the philippines to wither on the vine as had been the case in the pacific islands macarthur was all for recapturing the philippines but other military men disagreed with him did the philippines actually have the strategic military or political importance that macarthur attached to them and need to be recaptured even if the japanese had garrisoned them with million men or was it even the case that the americans had underestimated the transfer of japanese troops to the islands so that they thought they were facing soldiers when in fact there was multiple of on the philippines know that number of others argued for alternate plans but were those plans soundly based on information known in the fall of or were they after the fact critiques or second guesses of macarthur
40360 what made region an upper or superior region or lower or inferior region examples upper and lower egypt upper and lower austria moesia superior and inferior upper volta now burkina faso and lower volta region in ghana ive tried to research this there doesnt seem to be correlation with altitude relative orientation or size maybe it is whether they are up or down river but im uncertain about that
40398 today is the 155th anniversary of the signing but not the release of the emancipation proclamation critics remarked even at the time that it didnt free single slave since it only applied to areas where the presidents authority was not being recognized perhaps thats underselling it bit but it was certainly true that it happily left slaves in union slave states to continue their condition indefinitely so of course today see people on twitter saying it freed the slaves followed by deluge of wellactually responses occasionally followed by defenses that say yeah but only have characters that got me thinking what would be good accurate explanation of the importance of the emancipation proclamation that fits in characters or less its possible we could help save twitter and perhaps even journalist or two lot of bandwidth

40591 from what understand the mongols had engineers from china and persia to handle the siege machinery im mostly curious as if the machinery made by the chinese engineers was unique and or superior than the ones seen on the muslim and western armies and if their fortifications were ready for them the sieges im particularly interested in sieges of subotais 2nd western campaign against the isma ili fortress of alamut against the abbasid caliph in baghdad
40609 in patrick obrians men of war it says apparently referring to around the time the victory was built most of the british ships were not nearly so well built as the french or the spanish they were often slow they nearly always carried too many guns they were sometimes very crank that is they leaned over in wind so that they could not open the lower gun port or the sea would rush in and occasionally they fell to pieces in storm he then goes on to cite the example of the forty thieves ships of poor construction due to some dubious practices according to wikipedia and says that sometimes the royal yards were not much better despite this obrian notes that the royal navy won all the great fleet battles for variety of reasons better gunnery seamanship etc wikipedia also mentions financing superior tactics and other factors but states that design and construction were not superior up until around obrian also notes that british ships were sometimes built following the plans of the beautiful and fast sailing french or spanish ships that were captured given britains maritime history and the critical role the navy has played in defending the country against the armada and note also the successful invasions by the vikings and william the conqueror in the times before britain had an effective navy why was british ship building of such low standard leaving aside the specific case of the forty thieves compared to its main european rivals in the first half of the 18th century have read se question what is the origin of the english ship building philosophy and the answers there rather than answering my question david paigens answer seems to indicate that english shipbuilding skills declined from the 16th century is there any particular reason for this

40727 lovecraft wrote his stories including the cthulhu mythos in english but his wikipedia page notes that several french authors provided commentary on his stories it doesnt clarify if he corresponded with them though so its not clear to me if he actually understood french which languages did lovecraft understand in either spoken or written form unfortunately neither the wikipedia article itself nor other sources can find actually say which languages he knew
40733 havent studied the medieval period in much depth but some basic research tells me that the general populace after the fall of rome lost lot of the technological and artistic advances of the roman empire what cant find is exactly why the populace stayed in this state for as long as it did as far as can tell for the majority of the medieval period the technology economy artistic etc remained where they were in terms of development why what kept the people of europe from advancing apologize if there is an obvious answer feel like it should be obvious but cant seem to find it
40757 know for fact that allied forces were slightly inferior to german forces on some points know that the ardennes was ill protected on the french side the defenses were poorly constructed and the battles plans were not properly executed then found this source where german military planners claimed that an invasion via the ardennes had no chances of success because they had to sleep at night germany mass produced amphetamines for its armed forces germans were actually surprised that their plan did work so my questions are the following what are the objective reasons for the devastating defeat the allies suffered in the battle of france was the french high command actually that bad or did these drugs play major role in the french defeat
40770 ve found two examples hms rupert at years and hms warspite at years both launched in but not sure if these should qualify as they were rebuilt and the wikipedia entry on hms rupert says that on august she was ordered to be taken to pieces and rebuilt at sheerness dockyard although by this date the practice of rebuilding had become legal fiction and rebuilt ships were in practice new vessels incorporating small portion of their predecessors timber into the construction there is also the uss constitution still afloat and built in but declared unfit for service in and hms cornwallis built in and broken up in years but only years active service it seems that teak is particularly durable wood which is one reason why the british had number of ships built in india there are several instances of vessels built of this timber the frames of which are sound after service of one hundred years my highlighting unfortunately there are no examples of these year ships cited which have been able to verify note that by active service am excluding ships used as base ships museums tourist attractions and other functions where they were immobile but conversion from combat to cargo would be fine im particularly interested in non us and non british ships and the longest serving ships from the medieval period even if they fall someway short of the year mark best find so far for the medieval period is la pinta possibly built in and rebuilt to an unknown extent by columbus before the voyage probably not long before its fate is unknown after
40779 ive been rereading the plantagenets the warrior kings and queens who made england by dan jones and there is something dont get richard is praised for basically everything he did in his reign even taxing his people jean or john guess inherited quite bad england to rule and was blamed for it massive debts everywhere aggressive neighbors rebellious vassals and the like which actually was also the case for richard who waged wars far away for long time hes even listed among the other great plantagenets kings but what has he done that was that good for his people he was good crusader but thats basically it what did miss also on the many things that were blamed on jean during his early reign were his losses on the continent richard couldnt hold more than jean did since well it happened after his death but not long after richards army was defeated he was besieging castle when he died but his army was close to deserting beforehand cant find again the reason but the morale was just very very low thats why he went to the frontline in the first place im not saying jean was good king but hes far from incompetent and he really isnt the worst of the plantagenets so why is he so hated

40838 in during the munich czech crisis then british prime minister neville chamberlain expressed his distaste for making war preparations over quarrel in faraway land between people of which we know nothing that remark seems strange for just before the dawn of the jet age during an era when britain had global empire because the distance between london and prague was little over miles for comparison the distances between london and capitals of former colonies were miles for ottawa miles for washington and miles for canberra perhaps more plausible explanation was the reference to foreign german and czech people but that doesnt seem to make sense given that the british royal family was largely of german origin including queen victorias prince albert and mary of teck wife of king george perhaps im taking the phrase out of context but in the 19th century the know nothings were group of anti foreign immigrant americans who professed to know nothing about their positions otherwise why would chamberlain refer to germans and czechs as far away peoples of whom his contemporaries would know nothing did most of them actually feel that way or was that sentiment more or less particular to chamberlain put another way was he addressing large british contingent with quasi american know nothing mentality lady astor comes to mind apparently david lloyd george opined that mr chamberlain views everything through the wrong end of municipal drain pipe
40852 as the nazis invaded the soviet union incorporated conquered territories into reichskommisariat ostland reichskommissariat ukraine and military administration they went on to implement the holocaust and exterminate most of the jews in belarus lithuania and elsewhere already during the soviet invasion of poland many jews reportedly welcomed the invading troops apparently expecting to be better off under the soviet union than under nazi germany despite stalinist oppression and antisemitism jews must have been less bad off under stalin than under hitler in western european countries there was little time for jews to flee to neutral or allied countries it took the nazis only five days to occupy the netherlands for example and the logistics of fleeing to the united kingdom were complicated by the north sea but in the soviet union it took the nazis three months to take over the baltic states belarus and part of ukraine there would have been enough time to flee east why was there no massive wave of jewish refugees fleeing the advancing nazi army by retreating deeper into the soviet union apparently around polish jews escaped to soviet occupied territories at the beginning of world war ii
40869 nonporous ceramic glazed earthenware stoneware and porcelain has the advantage that it doesnt absorb water and today its vastly predominant since pottery manufacturing started with earthenware biscuit non glazed and therefore porous earthenware my question is when did nonporous ceramic become widespread or dominant used more than earthenware biscuit switching from pottery thats not usable for holding liquids to pottery that is good for that looks like an important point in history to me widespread is relative term but think it is possible to build consensus about what widespread use of certain object in history means the bronze age is characterized by widespread use of bronze
40988 im trying to write story in which the main protagonist is fictional polish spy who has to retrieve macguffin thats been captured from the germans it is set in the spring of she therefore needs to get into german occupied poland and back out afterwards which is the main focus of the story avoiding wehrmacht and gestapo patrols what kind of aircraft would be used for the drop and where would it have flown from id originally envisioned lysander flying via scandinavia but then realised that there was no allied controlled territory there at that time so im assuming it would have been parachute drop from long range aircraft directly from the uk

41054 in the early modern era several european nations dramatically expanded their territory through conquest all of them used violence and coercion to push their frontiers forward the notion that spains conquest was uniquely brutal and immoral became meme called the black legend even now the neutrality of the preceding wikipedia article is being disputed some people see it everywhere and some think it never existed certainly more writers claimed to identify it than claimed to accept it is there similar dispute about the morals and methods of russian expansion if so what is the name of that debate and in which countries and eras did the key narratives arise
41079 im continuing to read about the history of toys the imports between of its toys from chinese manufacturers depending on the year and my understanding is that they many western countries follow similar practices ive been trying to nail down the earliest origins of this trend and how it developed historically but have had little luck separating the history of toy making from the long history of chinese economic relations in general any help would be appreciated thanks for your time bonus question im guessing the answer to this question begins with china being reopened in the 70s but was there ever any significant toy trade prior to the revolution of bonus bonus question based on comments made below if anyone wants to expand their answer to also include more general information on the history of toy imports from east to west that would also be great and possibly worth bounty but as per site rules the original question stands as is bounty edit the bounty is already reserved when the hour requirement is up im giving it to asia for providing such an extensive answer all of the answers were great however so thanks to all three of you

41159 while in conversation my friend claimed that german soldiers were given greater flexibility at defying the orders given by the superiors than other armies around the world in both world war hence their success at many of the battles were they given this flexibility and if they were how could one measure the effectiveness of these kinds of tactics find it hard to be able to believe one could conclude that flexibility in defying the orders is one of the major reasons for victories

41243 during easter the japanese navy headed west into the indian ocean and attacked colombo ceylon now sri lanka the wikipedia article suggests that yamamotos main goal was to control the indian ocean and prevent british shipping to and from say calcutta the british might still use bombay mumbai or even karachi now part of pakistan but in roosevelt soldier of freedom historian james macgregor burns makes the point that churchill at least feared that yamamotos plans were more far reaching that is churchill feared that yamamoto might leapfrog around india capturing bombay and or karachi and cutting off india altogether worse he might head for landing in the persian gulf to link up with the germans in iran the book marching orders also cites japans baron oshima diplomat as making this point what do other historians or japanese military archives have to say about the scope of yamamotos intentions regarding sri lanka
41249 nowadays writing in all caps tends to indicate that the writer is shouting for example if type like this people equate this to shouting my understanding from cursory googling is that letters were originally only in one case and separate case was developed later with most people considering the first case to be capitalized and the second newer case to be lowercase newspaper headlines and advertisements sometimes lapsed into all caps but cant find any indication that the all caps typography was meant to be interpreted as literally shouting the headline at people when did people start making the distinction that using the default capitalized letters means the writer is shouting assuming this practice is old enough that default has any meaning
41274 the border between myanmar and thailand extends all the way near to the northern part of malaysia is there any reason how this came to be given that thailand and myanmar has been at war numerous times in history wouldnt myanmar be very vulnerable given the need to defend an area so far from the main block of land im not sure if this should be here or in history but it seems more about geography than history
41312 the wikipedia article on glasses says scattered evidence exists for use of vision aid devices in greek and roman times but only cites the example of nero emerald this article on magnifying glasses states historians seem to agree that the romans were the first to discover glass in the first century ad the romans were probably looking through the glass and discovered that the objects looked larger they experimented with different shapes and found that glass that was thicker at the center and thinner on the outside magnified the object that was being observed the benefits of these lenses were not appreciated until the 13th century when scientists used them to study tiny insects this is puzzling as anyone looking through glass bottle of water cannot help but notice magnification there is another reason for questioning the accuracy of the article the sentence about romans discovering glass in the 1st century ad the wikipedia article on the history of glass cites several examples of glass objects pre dating roman times by at least thousand years on the other hand haven been able to find images of glass vision aids pre dating the invention of eyeglasses but there are plenty of images of bottles beads is there any evidence of glass vision aids or did they use something else in particular thinking of 9th to 12th century monks poring over manuscripts and writing chronicles in dodgy candlelight or is this just movie cliche although people probably had better eyesight in earlier times thinking that many of these monks especially the ones past would have found magnification very useful even essential

41652 am reading interest and inflation free money by margrit kennedy have only found this book online here it is not in my local libraries or bookshops the author states page of pdf between the 12th and the 15th century in europe money system was used called brakteaten issued by the respective towns bishops and sovereigns it not only helped the exchange of goods and services but also provided the means of collecting taxes every year the thin coins made from gold and silver were recalled one to three times re minted and devalued on an average about in the process since nobody wanted to keep this money people instead invested in furniture solidly built houses artwork and anything else that promised to keep or increase its value during that time some of the most beautiful sacred and profane works of art and architecture came into existence for while monied wealth could not accumulate real wealth was created we still think of this time as one of the cultural culmination points in european history craftsmen worked five day week the blue monday was introduced and the standard of living was high in addition there were hardly any feuds and wars between the various realms of power however people obviously disliked the money which lost so much at regular intervals finally towards the end of the 15th century the eternal penny was introduced and with it came interest and accumulation of wealth in the hands of increasingly fewer people as well as the accompanying social and economic problems the lesson here is that taxes should be levied separately and not connected with the circulation fee on money am looking to read more about such monetary system but can get no meaningful hits the book seems to have reference to this system reference but as do not have the book cannot check which is wikipedia has little mention on this monetary system similar to what it is in the book google scholar has no relevant result in english mainly in german are you aware of any study on this monetary system could get some references on this

41767 believe this coin is roman but id like that confirmed can anyone give an approximate date and any other information possible maybe difficult as it is quite worn it measures between 5cm and 7cm in diameter id also be interested to know if possible what it could have bought at the time loaf of bread pair of shoes edit examining the coin in bright light under magnifying glass one can detect more than in the photos specifically one can see letters circled below there are two letters inside the yellow circle av presumably the first two letters of augustus though im not sure this helps much perhaps more useful are the letters in the white and blue circles these letters look too far apart to be from the same word the one inside the white circle looks like while the one inside the blue circle could be or possibly even if the second letter is im wondering if the two letters in the white and blue circles could be the first two letters of tribunicia potestate
41807 both the methods used and the range of crimes meriting execution changed under the nazis dark history says when hitler came to total power he decided that criminals and enemies of the state should be executed by either guillotining or hanging from and he ordered the construction of guillotines the guillotine in the plotzensee prison execution room source https ghb67 wordpress com the guillotine in nazi germany several other sites heres one mention the methods used for capital punishment in nazi germany in summary the three main methods of execution were generally guillotine used for criminals replaced the axe which had been used before hitler came to power hanging used for political enemies shooting used for political enemies and by the military among the crimes which could or did carry the death penalty were grave arson aiding and abetting treason betraying secret mandatorily procuring secret for the sake of betraying it insidious publishing or rhetoric failure to denounce capital crime destroying means for military use sabotagemandatorily for soldiers kidnapping mandatorily dangerous habitual criminal or one convicted of rape and so on what can find out is why the guillotine was used for criminals and usually hanging or shooting for political enemies the guillotine seems more merciful than hanging so it seems the nazis regarded political enemies as worse than murderers rapists but this is just guess based on little evidence are there any documents or were any statements made explaining the reasons for the methods of capital punishment used for different kinds of prisoners wikipedia quotes hitler saying capital punishment is deterrence but there is nothing on the methods also an exception was made for the six members of the white rose anti nazi resistance organization who were beheaded in why was this exception made for the white rose movement

41864 my impression wholly prone to error is that despite centuries of roman occupation after the anglo saxon invasions latin virtually became dead language in britain other parts of the roman empire such as gaul france hispania spain and portugal the italian peninsula and dacia also saw the retreat of the romans and were invaded by tribes in their wake yet the romance languages of all these countries are in important ways modern versions of latin what made the british experience so different
41896 was watching the excellent documentary historien om danmark and they basically said denmark and scandinavia as whole was pretty much isolated until viking age starting in late 8th century period ad was very curious about this despite the relatively short distances and the fact of being close to germans and other northern european nations that could be reached by land basically they traveled by sea with little contact with neighboring countries also before the viking age in viii century they could have attacked what is now germany they did but mean extensively poland belgium holland and even lithuania and france traveling near the coast which is much safer however they invaded scotland and england which are much further away traveled to iceland greenland and even north america with many risks on the other hand the benefits of civilization also came to denmark much later than the rest of europe prolonging the iron age for centuries in what became known as the germanic iron age and migration period maybe its possible that dangers that danish people might perceive were also perceived by other nations or simply other peoples did not want to trade or have dealings with them anyway my question is why did they choose this much riskier path when they could have chosen much safer paths and why were they so isolated from the rest of europe until the viking age

42047 among the non british pilots at least were polish czech and belgian but only were french and none were dutch norwegian or danish the reasons why there were many polish czech and commonwealth pilots are clear enough as are the reasons for the relatively low number of australian pilots the reasons for the lack of norwegian and danish pilots can also perhaps be explained there weren many of them in the first place and reaching england was probably more difficult for them than the french belgian polish and czech pilots who fled at the fall of france france however had europe largest allied air force at the time of the battle of france fighters which presumably means they also had far more pilots yet only or french pilots fought in the battle of britain compared to pilots from belgium fighters and what happened to the dutch up to fighters of course some were killed in action before the battle of britain but that was also true for the poles about fighters in set and czechs wondering if the formation of free french forces destined for north africa had anything to do with the lack of french fighter pilots in the battle of britain however given that the raf had more planes than pilots that surviving french pilots had invaluable combat experience as did the poles and czechs and that the fall of britain would have been catastrophic for the allies surely the battle of britain had to take priority over anything else note all the figures cited for fighter planes refer to operational planes it seems fair to assume that the number of operational fighters was not hugely different from the number of available pilots
42078 how were the dutch able to build successful trading empire by with the dutch east india company if the dutch state gained independence after the thirty years war in the war ends in with the peace of westphalia and the german states along with the dutch gained independence but if the company was founded in does that mean that in the dutch were already an independent trading state
42176 if we take hieroglyphic writings like the egyptian one an egyptologist knows that this hieroglyph must be interpreted as nefertiti or we can see in the following sumerian cuneiform script that there is syllabic representation of each cuneiform symbol since these writings and others are ideographic understand how could interpret these ideas by translating them into my language however how do historians and linguists extract names or syllabic groups from this type of writing especially when they are dead languages
42277 when we look back on another age we tend to skip to the highlights that goes double for things like art sports literature and music but in our own time we recognize that by divine fiat of all cultural production will be trash and smaller percentage of that trash may be all the more enjoyable for it in other words im talking about guilty pleasures the kind of plebeian oddball entertainment that gets you looked down on by your peers it might be relaxing or titillating but never edifying did the high middle ages approx have anything like that now id like to make two caveats first dont just mean pornography this question is only bit about the illicit what im really after is the childish the weird the base or the just plain stupid the kind of thing we know medievals looked down upon but still liked anyway so the pornographic certainly isnt excluded from the question but its not really the main point second im not just asking about class differences in cultural consumption unless those differences are seen in very dim light by one party edit or rather if its generally considered in bad taste so peasant ballgame or tavern song doesnt count on its own unless the higher classes look down on it even if some are also secretly into it despite strong informal taboo as in prince hal carousing with falstaff and his riff raff so to sum up sex and class are an important part of this but not the determining factor
42297 understand this may depend on various factors but am interested to find out whether many some any people in 13th century england would have knowledge of the stories out of greek mythology specifically an east coast port town if that would make difference if so would this knowledge have been limited to any social class more than others or depend on certain level of education literacy third what was the most likely source of this knowledge
42322 im watching the channel the great war on youtube which documents the goings on of the first world war week by week careful its addictive and there are literally hundreds of episodes it is my understanding that the british grand fleet was in size and strength pretty much unchallenged during most all of the first world war and beyond while the german imperial navy did bunch of damage to the allies brits it was mostly stealthy hit and run tactics employing boats and alike against mostly unarmed trading ships and transports so my question is couldnt the british grand fleet force an engagement with the imperial german navy to bring to bear their greater number of ships in decisive battle why didnt the grand fleet for example attack german north sea ports and or cities from sea im sure that would have forced the imperial navy to intervene leading to the big battle the grand fleet was longing for all along
42335 in caroline of ansbach married georges augustus in she moved to london with her husband as he becomes prince of wales she thus becomes princess of wales her husband became king georges ii in and she became queen in princess augusta of saxe gotha married frederick prince of wales and became princess of wales does it mean there was no princess of wales between and or did caroline keep the title until there was new princess or goes the title to some brothers wife
42423 know nothing of the cleaning habits of the greeks but about rome mary beard says that doctors knew that going to the public baths with an open wound would likely result in gangrene so it was known they could be breeding grounds for diseases if people were not careful nevertheless there existed public baths so at least some people had the habit of cleaning themselves even if these baths were also used to make business now the wikipedia article about mysophobia which is the more technical name of germophobia states that the term was coined in to describe people that repeatedly washed their hands in case of obsessive compulsive disorder this was years after bacteria were first observed in the second half of the 17th century and way after the classical era but considering that at least in roman times some people had the habit of taking baths is it possible that something resembling this kind of disorder could exist in those times even if not for reasons of bacteria my original objective was to ask this question about every civilization before but this would of course be too broad to be answered by single person and way too broad for this website so will restrain the scope of my question to classical antiquity term that as understand it is used to refer to greek and roman civilizations also even though the terms used to describe this condition are modern the point here is to ask if something that could be described as germophobia existed in this time frame
42484 after defeat in wwi the monarchies of the german empire and the austro hungarian empire rapidly crumbled and their outlying provinces took the opportunity to declare independence and sovereignty austrias problems are well known but germany also had uprisings in bavaria silesia posen and berlin itself and yet the weimar republic was successfully able to put down these rebellions despite massive economic industrial and military problems after the war and armistice at compegnie by the time the treaties of versailles trianon and saint germain were to be signed germany still held on to all of its land while austria hungary no longer existed as political entity the unified german state was only years old at the time while the austrian empire controlled its lands for much longer than that so why was it that the former was able to stick together so much better than the latter the entente powers all too happy to dismantle austria hungary and forbid the union from reoccurring also left germany intact aside from reversing the territorial gains of prussia at the expense of france and poland why if this was motivated by ethnic nation statehood why were austria and germany kept separate when both are germans and bavarians are closer geographically and religiously to austrians than prussians
42494 in the battle of france the allies and germans had roughly equal number of divisions and troops and the allies actually had more artillery and tanks but the one area where the germans had clear superiority was airpower with roughly two to one edge much has been made of the superiority of the german blitzkrieg tactics and the skill of the outflanking movement through the ardennes across the meuse and to the coast its true that the germans used their fewer tanks far better than the allies but could these successes and the failure of allied countermeasures be at least partly attributable to german air superiority and apparently german air superiority was decisive factor against superior numbers of soviet men tanks and artillery in ive played number of board games regarding france where tactics largely cancel out but the one thing that stands out is the superior german airpower has any historians made the point that superior airpower was the decisive not merely contributing factor and sina qua non to the german victory in france in
42547 shailja patel who guess is left wing kenyan intellectual says my italics it painful to us in the global south to see that american writers that we read assiduously and take seriously are not reading us they are not listening when we say please ask your president to stop killing us they appear to simply not see black and brown bodies beyond us borders obama bombs took tens of thousands of civilian lives his military intervention in libya destroyed the country with the highest standard of living in africa how viable is this as reading of the history my impression would be something like the following gaddafi was nasty dictator in the mold of saddam hussein who used ruthless force to keep the lid on internal divisions in his country whose borders had presumably been drawn arbitrarily by europeans he was pragmatic socialist and libya had good economic development by african standards gaddafis government carried out terrorist attacks in and the former resulting in us air strikes that attempted to kill him and that did kill about civilians libya had nuclear program which it gave up in the early 2000s civil war broke out during the arab spring period in within month the us came in with airstrikes to aid the rebels with token participation from france and fig leaf of legitimacy from the un security council and nato had libya not given up its wmds they might not have been able to do this the rebels won and gaddafi was killed in ditch libya is now undergoing period of warlordism involving sectarianism and tribalism im wondering if as implied by patel im just not knowledgeable enough to judge the facts or whether have biases dont realize how viable is her reading of the history it seems to me that gaddafi was demonstrably dangerous and threatening figure and that if libya has been destroyed lot of the blame is to be laid at the feet of libyans themselves they started the revolution in and they continued it on their own terms even if us intervention did tip the scales so that they won
42586 at the battle of sluys in the french fleet operated in accordance with the usual medieval tactics of fleet fighting on the defensive qui ret and huchet formed their forces into three or four lines chained together with few of the largest stationed in front as outposts the limitations of this tactic seem fairly obvious severely restricted manoeuvrability but according this article on medieval maritime warfare there are multiple contemporary accounts of ships being linked together with chains or cables in order to ensure formation integrity tying ships together was also used by for example the vikings to create fighting platform naval battles were often actually land battles fought at sea thinking that one reason this tactic of tying ships together died out was the increasing use of cannons on ships the first use in europe believed to have been at the battle of arnemuiden in when was the last battle in which ships were tied together the answer could be for anywhere in the world but it should be battle involving at least ships tied together note that this question refers only to ships of the same fleet being tied together the use of grappling irons for boarding does not count as supplementary question were ships always tied together side by side or were they sometimes for defensive purposes tied bow to stern
42593 in discussions with colleague of mine many years ago concerning the american civil war aka the war between the states he mentioned that the north left gave all the financial debt to the south he has since passed on but ve often wondered what he meant by that statement has anyone clue to this reference to its meaning and validity believe this is what my colleague was referring to but there no exact quote could find
42663 read in an old high school level history book that during the reign of nekau or necho ii during the saita period someone called hamon circumnavigated africa in three years however the book did not give any source or more details about this voyage or hamon searching for hamon and egypt in google did not bring any relevant results except as an alternative spelling of the god amun so is this claim true what are the details of this voyage if it happened the book in question is hist ria geral by souto maior in portuguese and published in brazil 7th edition
42828 in fdr was running for his fourth and final election he was starting to age rapidly he would be dead in just days from being sworn in to his fourth term henry wallace had been fdrs vp from at the democratic convention fdr would be forced in the name of party unity to leave wallace off the ticket wallace had recently become democrat and some felt too recently wallace was more liberal than fdr and that also was strike against him finally wallace was theosophist which lead many to think he wasnt christian and was just too whacky to become president question why was the junior senator from the backwater of missouri chosen as henry wallaces replacement what had harry truman former county judge who had never graduated from college achieved which made him favored to ascend to the vice presidents spot what had earned truman such great respect that he was the consensus candidate for this important job to sickly president in time of war
42848 according the medieval life and times website farm animals were small for scientific breeding had not yet begun full grown ox reached size scarcely larger than calf of to day and the fleece of sheep often weighed less than two ounces this is more or less echoed by the finer times or maybe one copied the other the size of full grown bull reached the size slightly larger than calf today and the fleece of an entire sheep weighed an average of two ounces the assertion that an ox wasn much larger than calf is unsatisfactory perhaps even dubious the size of calf obviously depends on its age and some breeds limousin are much larger than others jersey grew up on farm so know little about this wikipedia has this image of anglo saxon ploughmen but not sure how reliable the scale is and the animals faces are little odd even more implausible is ounces for the fleece of sheep according to sheep101 fleece in the us today might weigh anything from to pounds to ounces even just taking the lowest figure the difference between medieval and contemporary fleece weights seems improbable or is at least in need of more authoritative sources were the animals cited in the sources really so much smaller on average than they are today was the same true for other farm animals such as chickens and pigs
42870 in milan kunderas book the unbearable lightness of being theres mention of stalins son yakov who reportedly committed suicide quoting from the book emphasis mine not until were we able to read in the sunday times how stalins son yakov died captured by the germans during the second world war he was placed in camp together with group of british officers they shared latrine stalins son habitually left foul mess the british officers resented having their latrine smeared with shit even if it was the shit of the son of the most powerful man in the world they brought the matter to his attention he took offense they brought it to his attention again and again and tried to make him clean the latrine he raged argued and fought finally he demanded hearing with the camp commander he wanted the commander to act as arbiter but the arrogant german refused to talk about shit stalins son could not stand the humiliation crying out to heaven in the most terrifying of russian curses he took running jump into the electrified barbed wire fence that surrounded the camp he hit the target his body which would never again make mess of the britishers latrine was pinned to the wire is there any evidence that can support this story or is just part of authors fiction
42923 genghis khans military dominance was due largely to the horse and the mongolian composite bow so was surprised to learn that inner asian horsemen were using composite bows more than years before genghis was born in fact alexander the great incorporated horse mounted archers from the asian steppe into his military force so if genghis khans military was so superior to european knights and chinas military why werent earlier powers like rome crushed by similar weapons and tactics one possible reason is that genghis khan was simply the first to unite the steppe tribes still its hard to understand why western powers rome wouldnt borrow their tactics
42938 my understanding is that saturday has only become day off for most people since the 60s 70s and before world war ii it was working day just like monday friday are today also my understanding is that before the 19th century jews were very isolated but as the 19th century went on many jews were everywhere in western european society and if you didnt ask them they were indistinguishable from non jews european people and led similar lives outside of religious matters if that was the case full time workers were expected to work for days including saturday thus the only way for jewish people to work would be to work for and have saturday as day off even then they would need to leave early friday during the winter still applicable today as the sun sets early in theory they would be available to work for sunday but guess most workplaces were closed that day
42947 recently visited the basilica di santa maria in aracoeli in rome and found that the floor was covered with tombstones some of the tombstones simply contained text and decoration while others included sculpture of human figure some of the stones were sufficiently worn out that it was difficult to read the text the details in the face or clothing had been lost is this common in older churches the only other example can find onlines is st johns co cathedral in malta where is the person commemorated in the tombstone typically buried

42985 one of the more famous and certainly curious decisions at the second council of the lateran in was ban on using missile troops against christians specifically canon states that we prohibit under anathema that murderous art of crossbowmen and archers which is hateful to god to be employed against christians and catholics from now on papal encyclicals online this is frequently misrepresented as crossbow only ban usually accompanied by far fetched claims such as likening the crossbow to weapons of mass destruction more likely it was an attempt by the church to take the moral high road in any case it seems similar bans were issued by pope urban ii in and repeated again towards the end of the century by pope innocent iii but cannot locate definitive sources or texts for either obviously the bans didnt last archers and crossbowmen continued to feature in european battles everywhere for example the famed genoese crossbowmen dueled english longbowmen at the battle of cr cy even found references claiming pope gregory ix employed proven al mounted crossbowmen against the lombard league in but that seems bit dubious since afaik they were allied against the holy roman emperor that year what am curious about is whether the ban had any actual effect on european warfare or diplomacy at all did any feudal lords ever take the ban seriously or had it been unenforced right from the start was there any outrage when the ban was violated or was it always ignored by the secular world did any contemporaries actually take note of the ruling
43036 exactly what it says on the tin this is clearly german mark note of some kind but cant find pictures online of any notes like it the reverse is completely blank with some bleed through from the dringend stamp the white balance on my camera is rather off and the note is actually far more yellowish than the photo implies so the question is twofold what era is this note from what is the meaning of the stamps

43166 this is very layman question since my only source of knowledge is wikipedia im sure there are works that cover this subject in more details please mentioned them in your answer wikipedia says the great stand on the ugra river marks the end of the tatar mongol yoke in russia it also says on october ivan gradually started to pull his armies back to kremenets for winter quarters akhmat waited for reinforcements until november and then turned south among other reasons for akhmats retreat was the possible threat of crimean nogai or other attacks on his unprotected home base common problem in nomadic warfare as nikolai karamzin wrote in his history of russian state it should have been an odd image two armies ran away from each other not pursued by anyone so akhmat retreated alright but that also was the end of the yoke for some reason how did that happen and why
43181 russian soldiers first used firearms in against the mongols it is not mentioned in the article whether the mongols also had guns this would prove to be an insufficient advantage at the time but century later the firearms helped secure victory and break mongol power in the west according to muscovite chronicles the mongols did not have any guns during the great stand which contributed to their retreat however according to this answer gunpowder got to europe through the mongols or through the silk road of which the mongols controlled large sections originating from china which the mongols controlled the mongols even used gunpowder weapons in their invasion of korea and used rockets against the magyars in why then many years later did the mongols lose access to firearms and gunpowder weapons while their subject russians gained them
43215 and what laws or institutions sprang up to deal with them slaves have the effect of depressing wages for poor workers if this has been universal im curious whether slave owning cultures have found ways to keep adequate jobs available for the free working class or otherwise compensate them to avoid social unrest for example like the roman cura annonae and regardless of state intervention is there an identifiable trend in what jobs were left over im most interested in classical and medieval slave owning civilizations in the mediterranean and near east apart from rome as it was well covered in the question linked above and in this one as well think this is an appropriate scope for question about world historical trends as im asking about very specific effect of slavery rather than the whole institution an effect that has presumably been more prominent in some societies than others which could help further narrow it further but if you think its still too broad please indicate in the comments and ill edit the question if see consensus thanks
43217 nyrb article mentions blue chickens sold in state grocery stores an anecdote about life in the soviet union also mentions that lue chickens would sometimes be sold outside the regular small grocery stores why would chickens be blue was it due to some sort of chemical treatment for the benefit of those who think that by blue chickens theyre referring to chickens with few feathers that might at stretch be considered blue here is the fuller quote from the nyrb article nor would the private markets sell mayonnaise they sell everything else poultry birds proudly displaying curly yellow fat in their cavities as if in reproach to the bony and blue chickens sold in state grocery stores imagine that these chickens were plucked in order for one to tell that they had curly yellow fat or were bony
43281 after lot of googling im still not sure about this finding the longest reigning monarchs is easy enough but im less sure about the one who lived the longest good candidate would appear to be harold fairhair ca to ca but his dates of birth and death are not certain next would appear to be alfonso of portugal or or to did any european monarch of the middle ages live longer than these two if not who is the longest lived european monarch where we are reasonably certain of their dates of birth and death by middle ages mean from around ad to around ad
43363 was wondering why the conflicts missile deployments etc throughout the cold war were basically all taking place in europe africa and asia when in fact the us and soviet union were only separated by few kilometers over the pacific wouldnt that have been the ideal area for nuclear standoff this also makes the cuba crisis look weird to me why make such big deal out of transporting missiles all the way to cuba when the soviets could have just moved and placed them within their own territory

43433 while researching the danish monarchy for another question on this site the life expectancy of medieval european monarch came across the five sons of king sweyn ii who all became kings of denmark in their own right not junior or co monarchs harald iii reigned canute iv reigned olaf reigned eric reigned niels reigned sweyn ii had at least sons in all only one was legitimate and he died young the others were by various concubines so there were few to spare the only other example of brothers becoming king can think of is from the house of wessex the sons of thelwulf to the youngest of whom was alfred the great but one of them thelstan of kent wasnt really king in his own right and nor was he king of wessex like his father and brothers are there any other examples of brothers legitimate or illegitimate becoming rulers of the same country in their own right as instances of this must be very rare examples can be from any period and any part of the world but ill edit this if my assumption is proven to be wrong
43471 what point was rousseau trying to make in the social contract know that it has to do with contract between the people have read the social contract it is very hard for me to understand have tried to research on the internet using both scholarly sources and things such as wikipedia and so forth but im still not understanding have found that it may be an unwritten contract between the people and the government stating that the people will decide vote on the laws that are fit for their society
43502 have heard that maryland was the birthplace of religious freedom in the us because it was founded by charter about which wikipedia says on june king charles granted the original charter for maryland proprietary colony of about twelve million acres km to the 2nd baron baltimore the charter offered no guidelines on religion although it was assumed that catholics would not be molested in the new colony at that time in the 1600s would this tolerance have extended for peoples of all religions jews hindus muslims for example or would it have been restricted to those inside the sphere of christianity
43511 the vikings discovered iceland quite early on in the late 800s although gaelic monks from ireland had settled iceland before that date unfortunately the date was never recorded the viking discovery was accidental after norwegian sailor lost his way whilst trying to get to the faroe islands settlement was setup in in present day capital city reykjavik when the irish monks arrived prior to the vikings were they faced with natives who had already setup human settlements would also like to include that island nations like greenland were populated by natives without any known landbridge to north america have little knowledge on natives and biology and what they stemmed from homosapiens neanderthals but do know that they evolved into humans
43553 am reading about cresaps war do not fully understand why colonies within the british empire had wars with one another did the british colonies in america have independent rules like the colony of pennsylvania and the colony of maryland and if so which british colonies in america did not were directly under the british throne also were the dutch spanish and french colonies in america around in the same way independent colonies or were they different
43572 can imagine that after world war the ratio of women versus men changed drastically during world war soviet casualties amounted to over and as military casualties were almost all men would think there were lot more women in the soviet union than men is there any recorded information on this subject if not is there any other country that has data available on this subject germany
43593 thats screenshot from battlefield season episode added the location of vladivostok in all my readings have never found japanese attack on vladivostok during or right before ww2 you can see the city is very exposed and very near both japan and manchukuo so wonder why the skirmishes that culminated in the battle of khalkin gol took place in and why didnt vladivostok come under attack from the japanese navy surely they didnt think much of the soviet navy since tsumisha strait the soviet invasion of manchuria took place in aug to why didnt vladivostok come under some form of attack at least from the air did the soviets heavily fortify this city with aa guns or something along those lines

43661 what made jew its complex question primarily because borders in central and eastern europe were moving back and forth in the years preceding ww2 mostly because poland was annexed for over century by germans russians and austria hungary empire that said there were groups of people that could not be easily associated with any nationality what have been considering mother tongue hebrew yiddish but also russian german polish and hungarian however not all hebrew or yiddish speakers were religious citizenship none of them had israeli citizenship as jews havent had their own state before ww2 polish german russian hungarian and austrian ethnicity clear but not much data about it religion judaism on top of these categories there came an assimilation poland used to be called paradise for jews paradisus iudaeorum so it is hardly surprising that many of jews despite their religion were primarily identifying themselves as poles and not as jews despite their religion many jews by religion almost considered polish to be their mother tongue in however actually an even much higher percent of jews by religion over considered themselves to be ethnically or in terms of national identity poles according to the previous census of what was single objective measure to identify who was jew during ww2 across all nations across all states across all religions and all war activities https en wikipedia org wiki polish census of

43758 in fantasy novels or roleplaying games it is very common for the characters to stay night at an inn hostel or tavern but im curious of what it was like for real in medieval times im particularly interested in britain but any references to other parts of northern europe are interesting as well like france and germany or eastern europe for that matter know that in roman britain they had so called mansio that were run by the roman government and meant for roman officials like tax collectors to stay in on their travels to the far reaches of the empire some of these even had bath houses but what happened after the romans left and we enter the so called dark ages during anglo saxon times the feudal system started to rise with jarls and thegn but how much freedom of travel did people have in this period and was there any need for travel didnt most people have farm to take care of and lived mostly self sufficient life guess there were markets and fairs now and then where they sold surplus produce if any and that required some amount of travel in norman times after werent most villeins bound to their village in the manor and only few freemen where allowed to leave the manor and travel so how much need was there for inns and hostels and would there be enough travelers to make it viable business suppose nobles had more liberty to travel but would they settle for an inn in village or would they rather stay at another nobles manor house or castle did this change later during the period the middle ages spans almost years so suppose lot of things changed during this time what about during the plantagenet dynasty and the tudor period after the black death and the peasants revolt in can imagine that the travel ban was not so strictly enforced and perhaps foreign trade had increase by now so that there were more merchants in the country doing lot more traveling in the mediterranean world hostels seemed more common even the bible mentions an inn in the parable of the good samaritan where samaritan takes wounded traveller to an inn and leaves him there with few coins for the innkeeper to take care of him but the restriction on commoners by the feudal system in northern and eastern europe seems to have made traveling more difficult and thus lodging rather uneconomic business am right
43926 in cavaliers and roundheads christopher hibbert notes the problems king charles had recruiting men for his army even in late august he had scarcely more than men and was greatly outnumbered by parliament forces according to hibbert while in nottingham generally hostile to the king the king became so depressed that emissaries were twice sent to london to seek terms for peace then on the 6th of september parliament declared that all men who did not support it were delinquents and that their property was to be handed over to sequestration committees hibbert continues this meant that many of those who would have been happy to remain neutral were virtually obliged to fight men who feared that their fortunes might well be lost if parliament won now undertook to fight for the king almost immediately volunteers began to boost charles numbers by mid september men had enlisted by the time of the battle of edgehill in october the royalists had almost achieved numerical parity wikipedia mentions an ultimatum from parliament but it is unclear if the article is referring to the sept 6th declaration and the article seems to be based on publication and little else why did parliament make this declaration on the 6th of september did parliament simply miscalculate or was there another reason alternatively is the impact of the declaration being overstated were there other factors which contributed to the increased enlistment in the royalist army

43967 excerpt from great captains unveiled by liddell hart after this holocaust hungary was occupied without further fighting an organised administration was set up and the land settled down under its new conquerors there was no attempt to push farther into europe apart from one reconnaissance into austria which strangely enough was carried out under an english knight templar who held command in the mongol army this is taken from the genghis khan and subutai chapter bold is mine right after the battle of legnica where the mongols defeated poles moravians and templar knights in the same book in fact just before the text quoted hart says the knights templars die fighting to the last man who was this templar knight
44063 the persian immortals were an elite combat unit during the first persian empire also known as the achaemenid empire they were known for being at ten thousand strong at all times for which they actually seemed to be technically immortal from hdt these were the generals of the whole infantry except the ten thousand hydarnes son of hydarnes was general of these picked ten thousand persians who were called immortals for this reason when any one of them was forced to fall out of the number by death or sickness another was chosen so that they were never more or fewer than ten thousand translation from herodotus with an english translation by godley cambridge harvard university press however it seems that modern historians do no think too highly of them during the persian greek wars of the 5th century from kleist joseph the battle of thermopylae principles of war on the ancient battlefield studia antiqua p84 and based on hdt whatever tactics the immortals tried on the greeks leonidas forces proved that they were the experts and that they were fighting against amateurs perhaps the next day would see change in fortune for the god king to crush the seemingly weakened and fatigued greek defenders after the first full day of battle and from foster edith thermopylae and pylos with reference to the homeric background thucydides and herodotus p198 this quote points to more general dismissal of the persian troops this economical narrative has so far shown that the persian forces could not prevail because their training and weapons are inferior in addition their spartan adversaries are better organized and protected by the narrow pass xerxes who believes he is the centre of persian strength is liability and is ultimately reduced to helplessness leonidas has been entirely absent from the initial battle description sentence length explanations of each successive day have been the building blocks of vivid story and quote pointing more to the immortals level of skill on the next day the persian immortals take over from the medes xerxes is confident that these troops will easily finish off the spartans this expectation seems justified these men are persians and trained and there are of them opposing the greeks however they fare no better but rather experience the same things as the medes herodotus explains why the persians can make no headway the narrow pass protects the spartans against the persians who cannot use their numbers and also have shorter spears but the spartans on whom herodotus focuses his account also contrast to the persians in skill the spartans showed that they knew how to make war among those who do not know how to make war the question the immortals had reputation in the persian empire but were they also feared by the greeks because of their so called immortal status
44125 the heir apparent to the british throne england then great britain then united kingdom is usually conferred the title of prince of wales according to britannica and wikipedia this tradition dates back to when king edward invested his son the future king edward ii however neither explain why this title was used prince of wales is an unusual title it is not hereditary automatic and doesnt affect succession it is only tradition to grant it to the heir apparent it also has little to do with wales as its title holders are neither welsh nor born in wales nor speak the language so why was this title used was there something special about wales or the title itself
44141 since the discovery of oil there have been entire nations that have literally been built from the ground up almost completely with oil money this has been done and is still being done in relatively short spans of time has this ever occurred in history at such magnitude relative to those times if so what were the consequences what parallels can we draw to today oil boom and its inevitable end am familiar with the gold rushes of the 1800s but they do not appear comparable to that of today oil boom
44150 in comment to response to another question geerkens made the offhand comment that the monetary supply of europe was grossly inadequate until new world silver arrived im intrigued how do we measure whether the pre modern money supply was adequate how do we collect the data to measure concepts like deflation if we assume that an inadequate monetary supply causes rise in barter how do we measure the rise in barter is there significant rise in the search for precious metals change in the rate of debasement can we detect the expected responses to deflation deferred consumption of goods changes in loan rates etc where do we get the underlying numbers to reach these conclusions what is the methodology although this question may lie on the boundary between economics and history im asking about the historical methods understand deflation and how to measure it im interested in how historians approach the specifically historical side of the problem

45323 when did president franklin roosevelt announce he was running again for 3rd term and was there any shock or outrage at this noticed the vice president john garner actually ran against fdr in the primary thats what led to henry wallace on the ticket also noticed that the republican candidate wendell willkie did make some criticism of the 3rd term but it didnt seem that strong there appears to be lack of serious or strong criticism and im trying to understand why it appears people trusted fdr for war and yet america was supposedly very isolationist so am having trouble why most americans would vote for fdr when he appears to me very vulnerable to these criticism edit another way of saying this most of the country was isolationist therefore if the war in europe is heating up why tolerate hawk for 3rd term

45473 was looking at this graph of the united states population over time and noticed the dip in population for many eastern states that starts around and ends in july of obviously this corresponds to the start and end of wwii but with the wwii death toll sitting at around dont think it accounts for the drastic dip in so many states at the time new york alone lost over million people between and were drafted soldiers the cause of the dip there also seems to be corresponding increase in californias population during the same time period was there an exodus to california at the time what was the cause of this dramatic population shift
45494 in digging into german foreign policy documents written during wwii found letter from hitler to mussolini dated 3rd of may of amid the norwegian campaign with the following account at the moment the most comprehensive preparations are being made for an attack on the english ports of debarkation situated north of trondheim hope that this time we shall succeed in closing the trap before the english are able to withdraw but apart from that the booty is already enormous for we succeeded in capturing almost the whole of the british landing troops material at the moment we are examining not only an enormous number of most important english documents but also their equipment arms and ammunition as for the documents you will perhaps be amused to learn duce how we came into possession of the most important box we have to thank the english radio for this when the english landed in andalsnes they considered it their duty to send forward brigade immediately to assist those forces which as they thought were holding the position in hamar and elverum and bravely resisting us germans thus the 148th battalion of the brigade was sent forward by train and reached the district around lillehammer as our aircraft had meanwhile completely destroyed the railway road and telephone connections between dombaas and andalsnes the british commanding of cer who was advancing at the head of his band of heroes had not the slightest notion of the events which had meanwhile taken place in the theater of war ahead of him as shortwave transmitters generally scarcely function in these deep valleys the only source of information was the british radio the good colonel was therefore relieved to hear from the british radio that english and norwegians jointly were not only offering successful resistance near hamar and elverum but also that over and above this they had even repulsed the german troops so he marched gaily on at the head of his band and entered lillehammer he had with him tin box marked strictly secret not to be taken into the frontline containing all that the enemy must not see or get hold of in any circumstances as thanks to the english radio he was under the impression that there were still brave norwegian and british units successfully engaging us germans at least kilometers ahead of him he naturally felt exceedingly reassured believing himself to be long way from the front and entered lillehammer and immediately looked for quarters there so that he and his brave englishmen who were still suffering badly from the after effects of seasickness could go to bed at once german shock troops then awakened him somewhat rudely and took him into custody together with his military ark of the covenant the letter is found in volume of documents on german foreign policy series although the letter itself seems not to be available online archive org does not contain that particular volume the letter is mentioned in the index of the volume available here bottom of page now from what can gather in the wikipedia entry on andalsnes landings it reads the 148th infantry brigade commanded by brigadier harold morgan was part of the 49th west riding infantry division the german attack from oslo was catastrophic for the underprepared british who undermanned and underequipped faced heavy mortar bombardment which forced the norwegian commander to order retreat during which many of the 148th brigade were captured due to lack of transport the survivors who managed to escape the germans regrouped at faaberg north of lillehammer on april they were then attacked again by the germans who making use of artillery support outflanked and encircled many of the british positions until again the 148th brigade pulled back miles further north to tretten the last german attack came in the evening of april when germans supported by tanks to which the british could do no damage pushed them back to heidal where at last the germans halted the 148th brigade had been reduced to men and officers with brigadier morgan and his headquarters having been captured at lillehammer so it seems the armed engagement described by hitler did occur why would he lie to mussolini other than because he had been himself misinformed but am particularly interested in two things were some important documents stolen did in effect the english radio perhaps through some news bulletin in the bbc radio mislead the british troops can imagine that the british account of the war would omit these two issues if they actually occurred so im not sure british sources would be very helpful here if have the time as am in the uk will go to the british library and look for radio news bulletins around the date of engagement to see if such communications did indeed exist but before doing this it would be useful to have an alternative independent source that backs up such events am interested in this because if the two things above are true we have one example in which war propaganda by the british backfired on their own troops you might not agree with this lecture of events but this is unrelated to the questions above ps there seems to be memorial in lillehammer remembering those british soldiers fallen there

45535 ive found an online copy of william gates reproduction of the dresden codex written in some websites say that his reproduction is rather too stylistic to be reliable facsimile of the codex some others also give account of gates filling the missing parts guided just by his imagination can we trust his reproduction to be trustworthy does better facsimile of this codex exist
45612 traditional egyptology maintains that the great sphinx was carved around the same time that the great pyramid was constructed am relatively new to egyptology but it seems clear that the base of the sphinx beneath the restoration masonry the enclosure walls and the blocks of the sphinx temple are notably more eroded than the blocks of the pyramids what explanation is given for this assuming these structures are made of the same type of stone especially as the pyramids are much taller shouldnt they be exposed to more wind erosion not less is the sphinx carved of softer stone is it because the pyramids were once covered by harder cover stones which protected them for much of their history
45767 in english class while analyzing the anti war themes of book my teacher brought up something that had never heard before and honestly significantly doubt the accuracy of she said that hiroshima was chosen as target for nuclear bomb because the mountains around the city would enclose the explosion and rebound it back into the city for more deaths to the population and more damage to the city does this statement have any truth to it ive never heard anything like this and cant find anything about it online

45848 recently got the opportunity to visit the pearl harbor memorial in the informational video that they show guests they mentioned detail found fascinating most of the ships sunk in the japanese surprise attack including several of the massive battleships ended up being raised and put back into service in the war that made me wonder how did they go about re floating ship as enormous as battleship with sinking hole in it with 1940s technology what was the process like for doing that
45893 my understanding is that johnson embarked upon his dictionary precisely because he found others useless or archaic and that his work was very well received within his own time but wanted to ask if historians have more concrete idea of how closely his english resembled the language as it was spoken in england during his lifetime and how unevenly that may apply to speakers of different classes

45919 new spains independence struggle led to adopting the national identity of xico the name of its major city and the mexica society there in referring to specific indigenous group mexico seems to be unique among the independence names of former spanish viceroyalties got interested in what this meant for centralism and exclusion heres what ive learned about the adoption of the name in the principal newspaper gaceta de xico used the phrase imperio mexicano to refer to the aztec empire but in and afterwards it innocently used the same name for the viceroyalty algunas provincias del imperio mexicano con motivo del extra amiento de los jesuitas in the father of mexican independence miguel hidalgo consistently called his country am rica not using the term xico at least in the documents available on wikisource similarly the lista del juramento de los habitantes de san blas al cura mercado contains the demonym americano but not mexicano from to there was an official newspaper called gaceta del gobierno de xico referring to the seat of power if not the territory it governed this transitioned after independence into the gaceta del gobierno del imperio de xico in the plan de iguala and the declaration of independence both called the new state the imperio mexicano none of the principal revolutionaries were mexica but at some point they apparently reached consensus to use the meronym xico for their new country it would have begun to describe areas never subjugated by the mexica like sinaloa guatemala and new mexico understandably some apaches and mayans proceeded to resist the authority of country whose name excluded them prior to who supported or opposed the adoption of the name mexico how seriously were alternatives like america considered
45928 according to this article origin and evolution of money coins for many centuries were guaranteed by their intrinsic value that is to say by the trade value of the metal used in their production this made putting the unit of currency on coins unnecessary though that is not to say that none of these had face value indicated however if this page on roman coins is anything to go by it seems the romans never indicated currency or face value on their coins and it seems that british coins from for example the reign of henry viii also did not despite extensive googling including several wikipedia pages and also this timeline ive been unable to find out when coins first showed currency or face value the above cited article mentions the end of the last century but there is louis xvi coin from which shows face value of sols this british coin from george iii farthing also suggests otherwise source http www colincooke com collections the douglas collection html of course there is the possibility that for centuries most coins did not have face value while the occasional one did for example unlike the coin above this more recent queen victoria coin has no face value what is the oldest known coin in the world which shows face value or currency

46078 my understanding is that the uss nautilus the first nuclear submarine is now museum this boat was real nuclear vessel so it should have all the hazards associated with decommissioned nuclear propulsion system why was this allowed whenever ships like the uss enterprise cvn are not permitted to become museums the ostensible reason for the enterprise is that it is too dangerous due to the ships nuclear reactors would think the same would apply to the nautilus
46128 imagine an unmarried couple in their mid twenties both educated teachers they live in vienna of the early 1930es before the anschluss was it acceptable for them to book one hotel room and sleep in one bed without being married was it something common or would they be looked at by decent people incl the hotel personnel facts could find the nazis encouraged premarital sex by creating camps for young men and women close to each other and establishing organizations where women incl unmarried ones could give birth in safe environment lebensborn their motivation was to improve the demography source german wikipedia assume that the nazis could not enact any laws that were in too big an opposition to common morals if premarital sex was acceptable in it probably also was acceptable in at least among people from cities
46154 theres this quote by lerone bennett jr where he said back there in the 1660s before jim crow before the invention of the negro or the white man or the words and concepts to describe them the colonial population consisted largely of great mass of white and black bondsmen who occupied roughly the same economic category and were treated with equal contempt by the lords of the plantations and legislatures curiously unconcerned about their color these people worked together and relaxed together with the state of things these days its really hard to believe that race was something that people were unconcerned about the quote is specifically talking about colonial america but it would make sense that if things were like this there then it wouldnt be too awfully dissimilar in other parts of the world is there truth to what lerone bennett jr said did race really used to be non consequential thing
46161 there seems to be almost consensus that the medieval belief on flat earth is myth wikipedia even has whole article dedicated to this subject and the general argument is that the flat earth myth was constructed by 19th century scholars who wished ill on the church however recently came across this book the house of wisdom how the arabs transformed western civilization in chapter two the author jonathan lyons claims that most medieval scholars indeed did believe earth to be flat he bases this on the fact that 6th century scholar isidore of seville made mistake when translating ancient greek texts to latin which lead to hugely popular medieval encyclopedia claiming that the earth was actually flat lyons proposes that while another author of the same era british monk named beda did indeed study the original texts of plinius and did discover that the earth was round his work was not as widespread as isidores and thus the flat earth became consensus among the scholars of the middle ages even though some retained knowledge of the spherical form of earth since most internet sources on medieval flat earth theory do not even mention etymologiae yet it does seem to have been an influential work it is left unclear whether most medieval scholars in europe believed earth to be round or flat which one is it

46250 for all what we know the mongolian empire was not simply collection of brainless brutes but they had intense knowledge of their opponents descriptions maps information about the technology culture and especially competing groups of people which can be used to their advantage also their military leadership was efficient knowledgable and adaptable khublai khan was very interested in adapting and fostering chinese and muslim knowledge so why did the mongols destroy the libraries when they raided baghdad in shouldnt the vast knowledge available about the lands in the west europe and africa and the available technology have tempted them to plunder and evaluate the scriptures for their own purposes

46354 read here that the main reason tyndale was executed by the church was because he translated the greek bible into english somewhere else read that this is not true tyndale was charged with mistranslating certain biblical verses to support his heretical views and that is why he was executed this reason sounds more logical to me however would like to know whether this is true would also like to see real examples of his mistranslations or heretical views which specific verses in his bible translation did the church find offensive or heretical and what do we know about them
46393 after lot of googling on this and thinking the crusades might provide an answer the best ive come up with is louis ix of france who died in tunis on the 8th crusade thats miles as the crow flies by furthest from home mean from the monarchs capital city edit my reason for picking capital city over place of birth is that am interested in how far monarchs got from their centre of power and some english kings were born in france and guess some other european monarchs were not born in the country they ruled

46424 am listening to history of england podcast and so far only up to all the monarchs who started as children have been pitiful leaders are there any worldwide that have turned out to be good rulers understand why becoming king at such an early age would be terrible for you know if somebody had told year old me you are queen now it would have gone straight to my head to answer questions by child mean those who legally required regent at the start of their reign or were under years old in principalities that did not legally require regencies for the purposes of this question good monarch is one whose reign was perceived as legitimate civil wars pretenders and other crisis of legitimacy are indicators that he monarch was not good please note in the answer if the monarch was perceived as good by his contemporaries but would be perceived as especially bad by modern lights excessive brutality war human rights violations etc am just reading about henry iii and found this quote from his wiki page by henrys rule was increasingly unpopular the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his poitevin half brothers the lusignans as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts coalition of his barons initially probably backed by eleanor seized power in coup tat and expelled the poitevins from england reforming the royal government through process called the provisions of oxford henry and the baronial government enacted peace with france in under which henry gave up his rights to his other lands in france in return for king louis ix recognising him as the rightful ruler of gascony the baronial regime collapsed but henry was unable to reform stable government and instability across england continued edit thank you everyone they were all fascinating reads but as am suffering from brexit have to vote for home grown king james the vi and look forward to hearing how my podcaster covers him
46455 why didnt wehrmacht soldiers refuse to execute civilians and kids when it was clear that they did nothing wrong know that they were probably told theyre partisans or jews or something along those lines but still find it hard to believe that so many soldiers executed them for no real reason also how did those soldiers deal with the stress that obviously comes alongside executing innocent people are there any known suicides or mental breakdowns of wehrmacht soldiers after such executions how did the generals deal with those refusing to shoot
46526 been reading bit around the great famine of late its something that seems to have slipped from public consciousness in britain although the suffering it engendered seems horrific almost beyond belief it certainly seems clear there is great deal of truth to support the famous quote that the almighty indeed sent the potato blight but the english created the famine most modern historians seem to have coalesced around the view that the inadequate response of the british government was down to destructive mixture of ideology and religion that together with the weakness of the irish legislature that made it possible for irish landowners and the government to pass the buck between them with neither accepting final responsibility some have even suggested their intentions were good and that there was genuine belief born of ignorance of conditions in ireland that laissez fare would help the reviled trevelyan even apparently said in his instructions people must not under any circumstances be allowed to starve which suggests that in private his attitude was not quite as viciously inhumane as some of his other public proclamations suggest genocide is currently defined by the un as acts intended to destroy in whole or in part national ethnical racial or religious group and even those who sought the improvement of poor overpopulated ireland through death and suffering do not seem to have sought deliberate ethnic cleansing rather these attitudes seem in line with the general brutal opinions of poverty held by the middle and upper classes in the 19th century given the modern view of incompetence and ideology over malice what evidence do those nationalist historians who claim the famine such as john mitchel and tim coogan was deliberate genocide base their view
46542 in terms of repeated wars and other violent encounters where have the most people died throughout history cumulatively over time within one square mile this will include deaths at the hands of others or themselves using any conventional weapons as described here most things ive read have been about one day or one battle that is claims the most killed im asking about at any time between the birth of homo sapiens to now
46548 having brief look at civilization history find that europeans have significant dominance over other regions when it comes to sailing this becomes more obvious after the 15th century when europeans started to explore the new world and to colonize regions in africa asia america etc among other factors their navy technology has major role here have thought about this and wonder how europeans developed their sailing skills so much compared to other civilizations in the world example almost always at least since the beginning of the common era as far as know china had had higher population than europe if there were lack of resources because of the overpopulation and this would then lead to the need for new territories china should have been the first region interested in exploring correct me if im wrong as europeans did they also had access to the open sea in my perspective chinese and europeans were in the same conditions wide access to the ocean enough human resources china more in these circumstances china should have been more favored to sail and to colonize other regions ex india southeastern asia etc so what is that particular reason that im probably missing that made europeans more capable in sailing
46610 the fourth world cup was held in brazil in it has the distinction of being the first world cup held after year hiatus for world war ii it also has the distinction of being the only world cup india ever qualified for due to all the other teams in their region dropping out during qualification however india also ended up having to drop out after qualification and never played game why did so many teams from one region drop out was it financial issue were they protesting something

46713 the two bridges across the rhine river are considered among the greatest military engineering achievements in the ancient world caesars bridge across the rhine the first two bridges to cross the rhine river on record were built by julius caesar and his legionaries during the gallic war in bc and bc strategically successful they are also considered masterpieces of military engineering what is not clear to me is why the tribes across the rhine who believed they could stop any crossing legions in boats by harrying them during their crossing didnt employ the same tactics while the bridge was being built
46754 the olympics was famously boycotted by the us and sixty five other countries however its not clear to me how the us government was able to prevent their athletes from participating given that the us is democracy and doesnt have direct control over neither the us olympic committee nor any individual athletes so how did the us government manage to make the boycott success was there law that banned participation in the olympics
46764 the title sums it up quite nicely at school we refer to the centres of the christian world as being rome constantinople antioch jerusalem and alexandria im only wondering if there is any evidence as to why nicea was chosen as the location for such an important event edit im referring to the first council where the nicene creed was written
46833 when people discuss the causes of hitlers defeat in russia one topic is frequently mentioned climate people claim that winter contributed significantly to the problems of german army on the eastern front however to me this argument looks naive germany is big and several parts of it are affected by cold climate as much as russia justification here are the average temperatures in berlin december january february here are the average temperatures of moscow december january february in my opinion berlins climate is slightly milder than moscows but not different enough for germans to not know that its cold in winter they experience snow ice and wind every winter was the cold climate by itself serious factor that helped the russians defeat the germans in wwii or not
46854 recently read antony beevors berlin the downfall the author has described wanton acts of looting murder arson and rape in the so called liberated areas from german occupation in eastern central europe which after wwii was the communist bloc the behaviour of the red army soldiers nkvd and smersh was not much different from the behaviour of wehrmacht ss and gestapo while nuremberg trials tried the war crimes of germany and its allies why were the war crimes of allied forces not tried this may be marked as duplicate of the question what other war crimes trials besides those of nazi war criminals were held after wwii or similar questions but it is specific to red army since basically both nazi germany and stalinist russia were birds of the same feather though at opposite ends of the spectrum this is my first question on the history site in case of some discrepancies the question may be properly edited to be acceptable
46900 how did the inhabitants of sarajevo survive year siege from to specifically how did they deal with water food and heating background in sweden sent out leaflet if crises or war comes informing the population on how to prepare for such situations focusing on water food heating and communication cannot find the original source but someone knowledgeable in the matter told me that government report claimed that the average swede is self sufficient for less than one week my random sampling among friends and neighbors suggests that this number makes sense recently saw the bbc documentary death of yugoslavia and comparing the self sufficiency of the average swede with the duration of sarajevos siege cant help wonder from the bbc documentary understood that the city had no electricity no gas and had all roads cut off no electricity likely means that the water pumps were off line did people take water from nearly rivers what about in winter roads cut off likely means that supermarkets were empty how did they get food when todays cities are so reliant on transportation am tempted to think it is impractical to store enough food for so many people for such long time no gas likely means no heating how did people survive the winters apology im sorry if this question comes too early understand that the events in this question are very recent and many still suffer the consequences weird mixture of admiration respect sadness and grief crosses me while typing these lines
46943 regarding napoleons molehill quote the version have always heard is europe is molehill it has never had any great empires like those of the orient numbering six hundred million souls got napoleon life by andrew roberts yesterday and so far find it much better than any other publication have read on the man roberts version of the quote is for napoleon it order to invade egypt represented an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both his greatest heroes alexander the great and julius caesar and he did not rule out the possibility of using egypt as stepping stone to india europe is but molehill delighted napoleon told his private secretary all the great reputations have come from asia given the context conquest of egypt and his personal idolation of alexander and julius caeser roberts version makes more sense but when one searches for the quote top results point to the earlier version which makes more sense as to why he used the word molehill to describe europe something which feel roberts version doesnt with further research there appear to be two other versions europe is molehill we must go to the orient all glory has always been acquired there frederick quinn and the more credible given that it is written by known associate of napoleon who presumably was the man napoleon made the comment in question to europe is molehill there have never been great empires or revolutions except in the east where there are men louis fauvelet de bourrienne in his memoirs of napoleon so which version is correct if its the former then was it really in the context of directory allowing napoleon to invade egypt if its the latter then why did napoleon describe europe as molehill if he was just talking about chance to gain reputation to be compared with the likes of alexander or julius caeser personally feel if anyone is accurate it has to be de bourrienne but roberts begins his book by criticising all pre existing books and memoirs including de bourriennes so there we are to summarise what am looking for is which version is correct what was the context what is the original french if possible

47010 among monarchs henry vi to to and edward iv to to both ruled england on two separate occasions hethum ii of armenia went one better ruling three separate times to to and to however one might dispute the latter as there is some controversy as to whether it is in europe or asia among elected leaders william gladstone went one better still as prime minister of the united kingdom to to feb to july to im interested in any period in history although would accept an answer citing either the effective leader the prime minister in the uk or ireland the chancellor of germany or the ceremonial leader the ruling monarch in the uk or the president of ireland or germany im more interested in the former than latter the real holder of power the manner in which the leader attained power does not matter elected inherited seized power by force etc however as the focus is on leaders making comeback after losing power re election does not count so margaret thatcher only counts once despite winning three elections note one of the answers to this question has an example of the moroccan ruler abdallah ii who was in power on seven separate occasions
47052 similar to this question what was the seven years war called at first but for yet different war according to wikipedia the hundred years war is divided by historians into three smaller phases the edwardian caroline and lancastrian phases but these names are also neologisms what did people back then call the wars they were fighting and once the fighting actually had been going on for hundred years or so did they generally start calling it the hundred years war or when did that name show up in the historical record

47104 at least on the western front trenches were heavily defended any charge was just suicidal with heavy losses for the attacker and much smaller losses for the defender as there is big strategic advantage to be the defender and not the attacker why bother launch an attack understand that breaking the line of defense of the enemy and conquer their land grants you victory but its not the only way the usa lost the vietnam war without being conquered they withdrew because they endured too much of loss
47125 often in movies on the american revolution and back when muskets were common place the opposing armies would line up facing each other and take turns firing one side then the other kind of like volley while im not sure if this is historically accurate brief research online says yes from more tactical standpoint why didnt one army just shoot then have their first line duck and or move behind the second line thus allowing the first line to reload and the second line to shoot with their already loaded weapons in such fashion that they would be hot swapping empty shooters with loaded shooters and not having any quell in firing from their side this always seemed like point of contention for me
47161 when reading about naval warfare in ww2 it suddenly struck me that sinking supply convoys was huge waste of resources especially in the later years when germany was desperate for oil and other supplies why didnt the german navy try to capture them instead would love if anyone knows of actual military or government discussions on this topic weighing the pros and cons of each method my guess the main goal is to deny the enemy of the supply rather than to supply your own nation it requires bigger force to actually capture convoy and lead it to safety in your nations docks
47187 have often heard that soldiers particularly allied soldiers would swap their weapons for enemy weapons during world war ii allies would take german weapons like the mp40 that were seen as step up from some of their weaponry unfortunately cannot recall where have heard these rumors from are the rumors of soldiers swapping their weapon for enemy weapons true this quora post answers some questions about the logistics behind why swapping weapons is poor as well replies to this reddit post point towards soldiers collecting souvenirs and armies procuring large quantities of weapons to be re chambered and distributed my question is specifically about the exchanging of weapons for better enemy weapons can understand soldiers on the front line taking whatever weapons are available to them if theirs suffered catastrophic malfunction or ran out of ammunition however this poses difficulties when resupplying given the drastic differences in ammunition types between armies even if they did manage to obtain ammunition once theyre removed from the front lines would they even be allowed to retain the weapon would imagine that they may even be reprimanded for losing their service weapon
47204 ive come upon numerous instances where pre 11th century person or artifact is associated with either the orthodox or catholic church the most recent example is in francis fukuyamas the origins of political order where gregory is titled pope of the catholic church and where further the influence of the catholic church in europe in the 7th century is discussed the wikipedia page about said gregory also states that he was pope of the catholic church from september to march ad technically at that time before the great schism there were no major denominations in the christian church for example the pope should be considered the patriarch of rome equal with the other patriarchs while im aware that catholic can mean universal these instances are clearly in the modern connotation of christian denomination and are not exclusive to the catholic but also prominent in the orthodox case what should we call the pre schism christian church today or if there is an accepted name why isnt it used instead of catholic and orthodox when referring to events people etc before the great schism

47257 im writing fiction work and there is scene about young well educated but stormy woman willing to stretch the boundaries of whats allowed im thinking about making her chew gum in public the story plays in vienna of the 1930s was it socially acceptable for decent lady to chew gum in public research couldnt find any information about europe in the us of the 1930es chewing gum was marketed as female product my emphasis gum companies then focused their advertising on middle and upper class women with more refined sensibilities their goal was to change gum reputation from product considered unladylike to something upmarket and even glamorous this shift began in the mid 1930s when americans looked to advertising print culture as roadmap for daily life ad featuring actress claudette colbert reinforced beauty standards by making gum synonymous with good health white teeth and perfect complexion gum became marketed less as sweet treat and more as feminine product chewing gum ad featuring claudette colbert source source this site claims that formal etiquette of the 1930es did not explicitly forbid chewing gum according to chewing gum etiquette by helen ufford delineator february who could think that thats an ad for chewing gum source because celebrities like claudette colbert werent ashamed of chewing gum and because there were special etiquette rules regarding it conclude that chewing gum may have been little bit provocative but not over the top not lady gaga grade provocative and quite widespread if it wasnt there would be no rules of conduct related to it thats ideal for someone who wants to push the limits but not too much like my character
47280 in the ancient times planets and stars were just thought to be some distant lights various beliefs and theories ascribed them various properties and meanings but the concept of planets being spheres of rock of size comparable to earth stars being distant suns and sun being as huge as it is and burning with at the time unknown heat and light source was rather alien obviously in times of newton no enlightened man believed moon to be an incarnation of osiris or anything along these lines have some decent estimates on when earth size and confirmation of its spherical shape were found herodotus bc and the geocentric concept was challenged copernicus but cant place in time when planets and stars were recognized for what they factually are like when planets were understood to be spheres of rock of size comparable to earth can you give me preferably timeline of the discoveries if that would be too hard rough time estimate
47298 the defeat at marathon plataea march of the and the hold up at thermopylae really suggest the need for some heavy infantry that can fight on par with the greek phalanx like how much of your infantry really needs to be very mobile the battle of gaugamela also displays the ability of the greek heavy infantry to deal with flanking manuevers sort of
47405 between november and february the british scuttled of the german boats surrendered at the end of wwii during operation deadlight they were towed to deep water off ireland and sunk the intention was to scuttle them with explosives several sank en route to the location and those that made it were sunk by naval guns the operation deadlight boats were what was left over after some were used for various types of target practice and couple kept as museum pieces that seems like whole lot of steel to just throw away why were they scuttled rather than having them broken up for scrap was this to avoid having to negotiate among the allies who they actually belonged to was similar thing done with other weaponry such as tanks guns etc
47410 there was estimated to be american deaths during the bataan death march while there was estimated to be to filipino deaths according to wikipedia cant wrap my head around why there is such huge difference both americans and filipinos surely would have had their supplies taken from them and so the amount of supplies would not account for this difference did the japanese exercise more caution when hurting american pows

47445 in developing this answer and others it seems fairly typical that start out broad and then add more and more detail as necessary to answer the question and respond to comments sometimes the act of digging deeper itself leads to need for more detail this can be both in detail and quality of sources for example in that answer started with broad sweep of the situation on the eastern front based on wikipedia and my own past knowledge in response to objections and assertions dug up specific numbers and better sources to check and rebut them finally went into details of individual divisions had decided to go further would have started to break the numbers down by year month and sector in this case my original assertions were strengthened but sometimes they are weakened by refinement or in more collaborative tone sometimes our understanding is confirmed sometimes our understanding is shifted it feels bit like the progress of science continual refinement of understanding it also feels like every level of detail acts pretty much the same whether its at national unit or individual level like zooming in on fractal is this pattern others have observed is it useful way to think about historiography particularly the casual historiography on this site

47496 from what understand although my english history is very poor to be the monarch of england one must convert to anglicanism as the monarch is also the head of the anglican church believed this had extended since the beginning of the anglican church with henry viii but recently learned that james ii and vii just one person two titles was the last roman catholic monarch of england ireland and scotland on the wikipedia page for him and he reigned in the late 1680s even just looking on the wikipedia page for anglicanism it seems as though it was fairly well established by the 1680s especially since henry viii reigned in the early 1500s am missing something why was james ii not forced to convert to anglicanism and if james ii was allowed to keep his religion would modern day english monarch be allowed to as well or is there legal reason why not today that there wasnt during the 17th century

47521 late last night found myself in remarkable argument with my partner she growing up in idaho had been taught that native americans regardless of tribe generally lived short brutish savage lives of hardship argued otherwise that life was certainly not idyllic but perhaps it was simpler and satisfying in way modern society isnt citing my own bloodline and stories told to me by cherokee elders as was growing up in communities in wisconsin off reservation she acknowledged that probably her histories are skewed by colonial perspective but that also am not arguing from strong position how do know what life was actually like for cherokees pre colonization given that no elders are alive from that time given that never experienced it what about other tribes ive done quite bit of googling here and my research is turning up abysmal results from what appears to be undergrad webpages lousy with spelling errors to bite sized bbc websites with almost no usable information that just uses native americans without even mentioning tribe cant seem to find any authoritative sources on what life was actually like for the average native american cherokee kickapoo winebago etc tribal member have meeting scheduled next week with librarian at the san francisco public library which should direct me but in preparation are there any books of primary source or primary source interviews that demonstrate life for the average native american tribemember preferably pre colonization or very early colonization preferably midwest area tribes cherokee kickapoo winebago ideally such history would also compare across several tribes but ill take what can get and collate on my own if need be so far the books ive found are clearly motivated by new ageism or are relatively unsourced dubious yet colorfully illustrated childrens books

47650 this was something read in the 70s about an early algerian war massacre this was in popular french magazine dont remember the name think readers digest and you re not far off now according to this article it was really gruesome took place in one locality town maybe all in day this wasnt series of killings about odd colons killed including babies brains dashed out on walls real isis stuff except and unexpected for the magazine demographics they were very clear on attributing sophisticated motives to the specific algerian rebel subgroup that did this they wanted to provoke french reprisals which they got in spades the french army got played went medieval on the area and any notion of accommodation such as with native algerians that merely wanted the right of vote went out the window as french military sweeps reacted brutally to the atrocities deaths this is years later on my end and the magazine wasn known for scholarship could have been exaggerated or misremembered on my end the numbers are fuzzy and don want to requote the french kill count of rebels but the article claimed that widespread french brutality in reprisals effectively shut the door on any negotiated settlement short of independence and pushed all the rebels groups into harder positions anyone have an idea of what event this might have been referring to
47723 since the days of pirates the thought of capturing the spanish treasure fleet on its way back somewhere in the spanish main was primary target because of all the gold and silver it transported to spain some of the colonies were rich in gold and silver mines what seems strange to me is that potosi was also rich from its mint and that the fleet not only transported raw metal but also coins made from that three examples of many for this scheme are found on the sunken ships from that fleet like the san jose or the el salvador and the mercedes trove is on display at arqua valeros spain hard won shipwreck coins finally go on public display in cartagena the simplified usual pattern taught in school is that colonies mostly deliver raw material and the motherlands trade with manufactured goods this seems the other way around that spanish ships transport coins to europe seems to be an unquestioned given so why didnt they ship exclusively this form source atocha treasure coins didnt find any spanish historical sources that weighed the arguments for either form and did not find any concrete number that would make comparison of the relation between pure metal shipped versus coins shipped feasible that leaves me theorising and without hard number am sure my imagined relation of both numbers is not even wrong by means of base rate error as just do not have any good rate or even representative sample over all the anecdotal nuestra senora de atocha seems to have carried coins but only over one thousand silver bars why bother minting the metal in the colonies increasing its bulk for transport when the trade was tightly controlled and regulated would it not have saved shipping space to only load raw metal cargo space is limiting factor and while it might not matter where coin is minted my current reasoning is that using the raw material for shipping it can be transported from every refinery directly to the port whereas coins need an extra round to the less numerous mints and then to the ports refined metal in rectangular shapes should then also take less space on the ships then coins is this more like doesnt really matter with silver or are there specific reasons
47726 was watching the film suffragette recently and she mentioned her husband having the vote thought he looked too poor to already have the vote but this didnt look like film to just ignore history ok the reform act introduced all adult householders and men who rented unfurnished lodgings to the value of year https www historylearningsite co uk british electoral history since the reform act which can imagine was quite substantial property in but who did it cover by would it have covered worker in factory as the film says so money she was paid shillings week which comes out to pounds year her husband was paid few shilling week more to say pounds between them so it is possible they could afford year rent between them but in that case which working men got the vote in if factory worker could already afford year house have just realised the possible significance of unfurnished did poor people all rent furnished property the film said this ordinary working man had the vote my calculations show it was possible he had the vote but the act gave working men the vote so one of these two statements must be wrong were working class men able to vote before the act like the film depicts

47907 how did people wake up on time before alarm clocks was thinking about this as lay me down to sleep last night and came up with null hypothesis they didnt keeping precise time wasnt considered as important in the past as it is now other options they did by intentionally going to sleep hours before they meant to wake up incidentally recently read snippet of socratic dialogue in which he claims that we spend half our lives in each state sleeping and waking is that wild exaggeration or did people sleep longer they did because roosters they did because church bells and other types of shift sleeping at this point decided to stop theorizing and just ask here where people might actually know fully satisfactory answer would give rough indication of how it was done in different periods if the available technology made any difference

48194 in the united states men aged are required to register for possible military draft the original argument was that the country would need large numbers of troops in hurry and back then there were otherwise no databases to locate eligible men in practice troops dont magically appear on the combat field the day after draft is declared it takes time to notify possible recruits confirm their eligibility induct them provide basic training identify their aptitudes and skills organize them into units perform additional training specialized for their role and transport them to combat zone regular and reserve forces do the combat until conscripts are ready so what was the shortest amount of time between when military draft was announced and when the first conscripts were deployed to combat zone clarification am principally interested in the answer applied to the united states csa however can appreciate those respondents who may want to reach wider audience have therefore removed the united states tag but ask that answers identify the applicable country clarification the question is specific to conscripts who have received zero training prior to recruitment in other words this excludes regular troops reserves and peacetime mandatory military service the israeli model
48216 wondering if there is an origin of the meals day concept for example in english we have specific words for them breakfast lunch dinner but we have few more for other meals in the day can only think of one actually brunch according to this we can add elevenses tea supper and then we have many special occasion time independent ones bbq feast but the main ones are breakfast lunch and dinner we dont have many other specific names for meal times in the day wondering if its like this in all cultures currently and if not how variable it is know nothing about this and then wondering where it got started if its not universal the paleo diet has lot of experimentation with meal times some even suggest meals day but its too early to have names for those then they speculate about hunter gatherer societies potentially eating at most time in day maybe not for several days in row so wonder what kind of concepts they had for meals

48386 according to wikipedia the japanese were the de facto leaders of the foreign anti bolshevik intervention in siberia during the russian civil war the other foreign powers pulled out by presumably having decided it was hopeless cause the japanese kept troops there through the spring of during which time they fought off more than one bolshevik assault and then by october they unilaterally withdrew apparently with many bitter recriminations at home this is stark contrast to put it mildly to the approach imperial japan later took to military intervention on the mainland so what was going on was there strong domestic opposition to the intervention in siberia if so why
48389 before the invention of the printing press and movable type and some related innovations by johannes gutenberg books in europe were generally only reproduced if someone copied them by hand in china woodblock printing had existed for hundreds of years at that time there was flourishing industry of printed books most of which did not use movable type woodblock printing was known in europe and examples of pictures made with that technique exist from before gutenbergs time books became widespread after gutenberg so there was market for them why didnt europeans create books with woodblocks if some examples of such books exist why didnt they become widespread addendum some commenters have expressed doubt that woodblock printing was large industry in china here is short encyclopedia entry that gives an overview of the history of commercial print publishing in china while the great boom happened in and after the 16th century commercial printing was common before that and woodblock printing was the most common technique used until the 20th century while woodblock printing is arguably more suitable for the chinese writing system than the scripts used in europe this shows that it is clearly possible to use woodblocks for book printing on large scale saying woodblock printing is impractical is not very good explanation
48411 both axis allied nations produced thousands of tanks during the second world war however not many of these vehicles survive to this day there are exceptions of course when reading about the fate of these vehicles its always said that these tanks were scrapped after the war for their resources what was the scrapping process are they pushed into giant scary blender or are they dismantled piece by piece and melted would think the second method would make more sense but then again also find cases like the m4 sherman in wibrin belgium which was saved during scrapping to be preserved as monument this tank looks like it was bitten in half can anyone clear this up for me and perhaps provide pictures of the scrapping process thanks

48518 at any point in history has an individual ever purchased an entire country using their private wealth specifically im looking for any examples of somebody who has purchased an entire already existing country not simply buying significant amounts of land and then founding new country from it ideally the person who purchased the country would then be in charge of its governance however if no such situation exists examples of things that come close would be welcome too such as owning all land and infrastructure but not directly governing the country has such an event ever happened in history
48535 am reading various books and material about the great war and in the vast majority of cases important figures are always referred to by their family names clemenceau pointcarr von hindenburg ludendorff von mackensen etc their given names could be added but theyre optional also you would never call anyone by their given name only nobody could talk about general paul and understand youre talking about von hindenburg what dont understand is why the austrian general franz conrad von tzendorf is an exception cant list where exactly but saw him being referred to as conrad at many different places when he should normally have been referenced to as von tzendorf the only other cases of people being referenced by their given names would be outside the western world such as the ottoman empire where family names didnt exist
48585 im wondering why marcus aurelius who could be considered as one of the most wise emperors of roman empire did not restore roman republic constitutions read somewhere that the functionality of roman republic were quite lost at that time but think its not convincing cause some imperial era historians such as suetonius were quite familiar with roman republic history and its constitutions appreciate any suggestion or recommendation
48697 in the wikipedia page of gaius gracchus you can find this paragraph which find particularly confusing when scipio the younger agreed to represent the italian allies who were protesting the injustices done to them which tiberius gracchus land reform was supposed to remedy he won the hostility of the people who accused him of standing against tiberius gracchus and wishing to abolish the law and incite bloodshed if tiberius fought for the citizenship of italian allies why would the people be mad at him for standing with such allies even if the roman citizens didnt want the citizenship to be extended to the allies to accuse scipio of trying to abolish such laws is not coherent
48717 was reading about hernando de soto and saw william powells painting relevant bit cropped and added below the odd thing marked with red arrow is the man who looks moorish and is dressed in moorish military attire unlike the other people in the party of course the painting was created some years after hernando died so it can hardly be considered historical evidence not to mention it is unlikely that the spanish would have allowed the converted andalusians to dress in that fashion but that made me think if there were any moors that is the conquered people of muslim al andalus who accompanied him in his expeditions have looked about perhaps not that well american history is not my forte but all the mentions of hernando and moors that have found are in context of his upbringing and the downfall of muslim andalusia in eight years before he was born or the moors that came with other conquistadors so my question is did any moors accompany hernando de soto specifically him not any other conquistadors if not why did the painter william powell paint moor there

48771 during the first world war both sides engaged in tunnel warfare the primary purpose of which as far as can tell was to place large amounts of explosives under enemy lines and then detonate them immediately prior to ground attack was there ever any attempt to use tunnel to bypass the front line to get soldiers directly behind enemy lines my understanding is that in conventional attack by the time any of the attacking soldiers reached the enemy front line they were likely to be wounded shell shocked possibly alone separated from his unit low on ammunition and likely to be seriously demoralised and that was before theyd actually got to engage the enemy themselves with so much tunneling going on wikipedia quotes 2km of tunnel for every 1km of front line couldnt tunnel be dug that could surface at or behind the enemy front line and allow groups of fresh uninjured well rested soldiers still in battle formation to quickly deploy having bypassed the majority of the barbed wire trenches and machine guns update heres the wiki item on tunnel warfare for clarification im not suggesting major attack exclusively via tunnel im assuming it would play supporting role in more conventional attack few hundred soldiers appearing behind enemy lines minutes before you go the top has give you some advantage doesnt it also please note the main thread of this question is did it happen so far most of the comments although interesting are just listing reasons why it probably didnt update following further research apparently there were too main types of tunnels fighting tunnels small narrow tunnels dug silently under enemy lines for the planting of mines and subways larger wider and longer tunnels used to get troops discretely and safely up to the front line the subways could be mile or two long and would be used to bring large number of troops to the front line trench immediately prior to an attack guess that these subway tunnels were only really practical behind the lines because they could be dug without having to worry about being disturbed and regular ventilation shafts could be sunk without giving the position away

48862 the early confederacy the founding states attacked fort sumter in april starting the american civil war the confederacy knew this would lead to war with the union yet they seemed to be confident in their odds of succeeding shortly after the start of war other states joined the confederacy they also must have thought that this was war they would win know the confederacy expected at least to some degree an involvement of europe that did not come cotton diplomacy but there must have been better plans than that unlike the confederacy the union had large industrialized and urbanized area the northeast and more advanced commercial transportation and financial systems than the rural south additionally the union states had manpower advantage of to at the start of the war what documented evidence exists which indicates the political industrial infrastructure economical military and or other significant factors considered favorable to the confederacy as reasons for having confidence in victory over the union
48889 am correct in assuming that truman and only truman had the authority to order the bombing of hiroshima after all it was the very first bomb and procedures may not have been formalized yet it occurs to me that maybe theater commander like gen macarthur could have given the order given that truman was at potsdam when he made the decision to bomb hiroshima did he have secure method of communications to use to communicate his order from potsdam if so what was that method when was that order actually given im guessing it was at least several days before the bombing since someone had to order the bomb moved to tinian and plane and flight crew chosen and assembled at tinian could truman have aborted if hed changed his mind how late could he have successfully aborted right up until the bombardier pressed the bombs away button or would it have been early say up until the moment enola gay left tinian after which it might have been running silent realize this is all academic now but its not impossible to imagine truman having change of heart and deciding not to bomb hiroshima lets say the japanese surrendered on august because they could see that the war was lost im curious how late he could abort the bombing if hed really wanted to

48922 live in british columbia and it is well known that in the late 19th century there was massive crash of our indian population up to in some particularly unfortunate areas haida gwaii for example lot of this was due to smallpox im aware of the timeline of early western medicine around pasteur and koch so always assumed that whatever the intentions were on the us british and canadian side there wasnt much that they could have done about it had they chosen to help however on visiting maui was extremely surprised to see that some of the missionaries there around were trying to vaccinate the hawaiians against smallpox looking it up https en wikipedia org wiki smallpox vaccine it turns out that smallpox was atypical as it was known even with limitations of western medicine at the time that you could take steps to protect populations at risk hawaii aside when did large scale effort start in either the us or in canada past the 1850s or so to inoculate native new worlders using what was then known about smallpox vaccination just to be clear this is not question about intentional contamination such as blankets issued for that purpose or even an episode such as www macleans ca how smallpox epidemic forged modern british columbia where it might or not have suited the authorities to have an epidemic

49063 since there were lot of jews pre ww2 in germany and germany was responsible for the many deaths of jews during the holocaust it seems logical to suggest that new jewish state should maybe be created in germany arab leaders like the house of saud at the time seem to have suggested this specific solution citation the documentary the house of saud was something like that ever discussed did it gain any traction why why not

49152 it was suggested in tv interview that saw that prior to in the uk women were owned by men an example to solidify this was women taking on their husbands last name my question is were women not been able to own property mean that they were in fact property themselves as in they could not own land but could they just not leave their husband and go back to their families if they wished was it not the case that people who owned land in general were the aristocracy meaning that the vast majority of both men and women in the uk did not have land to own similar to the tv show poldark and jane austen novels the video in question is thirteen minute excerpt from the interview of jordan peterson recently by helen lewis lewis states you had system where one set of people owned another set of people until women got full legal rights where they could own property themselves and they could work essentially they were owned by their fathers and then by their husbands

49211 have heard historians claim that enemies ball bearing factory locations were coveted piece of intelligence have also heard that big money industry for both the allies and axis super powers colluded to not bomb each others ball bearing factories because it would end the war too soon these are some narrative fragments that have always left me curious about the significance of ball bearings to industry and particularly war industry were they high leverage pinch point in the type of supply chain necessary to build modern military
49226 inspired by the question about the strait of gibraltar wondered how germany was able to get troops to north africa given the naval power of britain based upon this question would doubt that they went through turkey the wikipedia article was interesting but did not mention how and where german forces arrived were they able to use ports in italian controlled libya even still why didnt britain simply sink the german vessels if italy controlled the mediterranean how was britain able land troops what navy controlled the mediterranean during the north african campaign
49243 looking at wikipedia dates given are september september which end in the defeat of japan however why is the starting date when germany invaded poland and not when the japanese invaded china in the sino japanese war on july which then ends on september same date as ww2 why is it considered that ww2 started on september and not july edit as per request by sempaiscuba another argument that could be put forward for china was first to sign un charter as first victim of aggression by an axis power so it could be argued that at the time of signing in consensus was that start was otherwise it should be poland
49263 ive read somewhere that newton ordered the hanging of criminals that were cheapening the crowns coinage whilst he was master of the mint find this little surprising having really known him as theologian physicist mathematician alchemist and experimenter is this true how many men did he hang and over what period did his measures work as master of the mint one would not expect that newton had the authority to directly prosecute for the ulitimate penalty but this does not mean that he may have advocated for such measures to the legislature

49342 in the odyssey penelope is courted by suitors who camp out in her house royal court indefinitely behaving badly while she delays them im having trouble understanding the historical and cultural context here is enough known about the culture of homeric greece to definitively explain whats going on or is it subject to interpretation it seems clear that the suitors have an understandable motive to take over the kingdom of ithaca its less clear to me whether their behavior is meant to be seen as total violation of cultural norms or what norms might be violated features of the story such as the great length of time and the large number of suitors seem like exaggerations for effect but are the aberrations meant to excite horror in the listener or are they just exaggerated versions of plausible events when queen was widowed the suitors end up getting killed which is seen as just in this culture do they deserve death simply because they persistently courted penelope or because they abused her hospitality or because of their separate misdeeds such as the plot led by antinous to murder telemachus does penelope fail to eject them because she lacks the physical power because she lacks the legal and political authority or because shes behaving as an exaggerated model of hospitality hospitality is virtue that was much admired in the ancient world and is modeled by telemachus in his interaction with athena if great hospitality is seen as an obligation of rich noblewoman then is she enhancing her legitimacy by showing such extreme hospitality if her problem is lack of physical power does this imply that the entire kingdom of ithaca is completely undefended simply because one man the king is dead or absent wouldnt odysseus have made provisions for the security of his kingdom court and family before leaving for troy if penelope wanted to kick the suitors out could she appeal to her slaves to help her with physical force or would that be out of the question culturally cf confederate horror at freedmen fighting for the union would the suitors have weapons armor and training that would make it difficult for non nobles to eject them by force
49381 nancy qian economist who has studied the columbian exchange there really was no spicy food in the world before the columbian exchange denver nicks author of hot sauce nation before the columbian exchange there were no chilies outside of the americas which is to say when christopher columbus set sail for india in indian food wasn spicy thai food wasn spicy in the sense of spicy as in the heat pain that chilies impart there was no spicy chinese food highly upvoted comment at cooking se more interestingly chillis are also new world crops therefore all those hot spicy thai indian malay and filipino foods are actually modern invented after the portuguese or dutch introduced chilli peppers to asian cultures crash course until years ago indians lived without curry which contains chilies new world food the awl all spicy food is from latin america to what extent is the above claim true to me it seems obvious that spicy food has much longer history in asia than just to and that the chili plant isnt the only way to achieve spicy flavor also easily found the following examples the japanese wasabi according to this page the first japanese medical encyclopaedia called honzo wamyo was published in and it states that wild ginger wasabia japonica had been grown in japan for at least thousand years one journal article claims that the korean chili pepper gochu has been cultivated for at least years however this journal article has been criticized by several commenters below now moved to chat and was also recently thoroughly debunked by wotan weevil at reddit ask historians found this only number of days after first posting this question the szechuan sichuan pepper was already mentioned in ancient chinese poetry 11th 7th centuries bc english translation here but perhaps wasabi gochu and the szechuan pepper were rare examples and for the most part the claim of this questions title is true several have correctly pointed out that the word spicy is unfortunately quite ambiguous in english for example cinnamon and nutmeg are spices but are not what mean by spicy in the current context in other languages there are words for what am thinking of in much more unambiguous terms picante in spanish in chinese or pedas in malay perhaps there is more scientific term for this that someone knows of am aware that there is something called the scoville scale but this seems to measure only capsaicins which seem to be present only in chili have also found the following fruitful discussions on other sites from reddit ask historians what was indian food like before contact with the new world what was asian cuisine like before the colombian exchange what did old world cuisines that are today known for their spicy foods taste like before peppers were imported from the americas what is the history of curry who invented it how did it spread is it really british thing and not indian hot peppers originally came from the americas but india thailand and large parts of china are famous for their spicy foods how did they arrive and how long was it before they became an integral part of the cuisine from quora what was indian cuisine all about before potatoes chilies and tomatoes were brought to india the top answer at this last discussion quotes achaya we had glimpse in the last chapter that chillis are not really indian these wonderful materials were brought to india from mexico perhaps in the late 16th century they took little while to catch on but in about hundred years the use of chillis spread to every part of india before that it was pepper that was used to give the pungency that is so characteristic of indian food in one of the sections of the ain akbari written in there is list of dishes cooked in akbars court all of them use only pepper to impart spiciness in most indian languages the name for the chilli is simply variation of the earlier name for pepper in the same language for example in hindi we say kalimirch black pepper for pepper and harimirch green pepper for chilli in tamil the word for pepper is milagu and that for chilli is milagai milagu kai pepper fruit in kannada the words are karimenasu and menasinkayi try this exercise in your own language it is not difficult to understand why the chilli so quickly replaced pepper in our cooking while the pepper vine grows almost only in kerala chillis can be grown in almost every backyard or cultivated in fields all over the country thus they were easily avaliable everywhere at low price all the many varieties that we know come to us from mexico and none of them was developed afterwards in india these include the green chilli red chilli long red chilli very small and very hot green bird chilli and the large mild capsicum to make chillipowder the long bright red variety with thin skins can be dried in the sun and ground either with its seeds to give more pungency or without it to give milder chilli powder in fact it is no exaggeration to say that the humble chilli from mexico really revolutionized the food of india
49383 the armistice on november 11th was signed between am and am french time which was at this time utc one hour earlier than today wikipedia has photo of the event presumably taken at am however it seems hard to imagine this photo could have been taken by night according to this website the sunrise time in compi ges on november 11th is am utc which makes it on rising at am utc so this armistice photograph would have been taken in the dark 1h22 before sunrise this makes me wonder is this photograph really authentic note at the time of asking this question wikipedia stated that the photo was taken at am this was edited since by evargalo
49401 im curious whether womens suffrage has ever changed the direction of an election polls often show differences between men and women but they are often fairly highly correlated so wonder if womens suffrage has ever proved decisive in an election since this is matter of curiosity id welcome responses from anywhere in the world or for more narrow focus federal and gubernatorial elections in the united states following the adoption of the 19th amendment in the question is not whether or not womens suffrage confers political power on women candidates have to appeal to the populace long before the final election and suffrage certainly affects that political calculus
49427 having recently finished again the lord of the rings trilogy wondered what is the earliest known book novel trilogy in literature yes know tolkien wrote lotr not as trilogy but as the first volume of planned two volume work including lotr and the silmarillion but the two volume work was never completed and lotr now stands on its own in what we refer to as trilogy according to both wikipedia and britannica trilogy is used to describe series of three dramas or literary or musical compositions that although each is in one sense complete have close mutual relation and form one theme or develop aspects of one basic concept britannicas trilogy entry goes on further to say wiki mentions this as well but quoting britannica here the term originally referred specifically to group of three tragedies written by one author for competition this trilogy constituted the traditional set of plays presented in athens by number of competitors at the 5th century bc drama festivals known as the great dionysia one of the first authors to present such trilogy was aeschylus whose oresteia is the only surviving example from that time so we have there an example of what is thought to be the earliest drama play in trilogy form the wikipedia trilogy entry mentions the epic mahabharata attributed to vy sa according to wiki the mah bh rata is the longest epic poem known and has been described as the longest poem ever written with origins in the 8th or 9th century bce that might make it the earliest known trilogy of an epic poem however am having difficulty finding reference to the earliest known trilogy of books novels any literature students professors historians enthusiasts or librarians out there who may know which trio of books novels is the earliest known example in literature and the author edit for the purpose of this question let use the wiki britannica definition of trilogy quoted above
49442 similar to hand to hand blades would expect bayonets to be sheathed in non combat situation to avoid damaging dulling the blade and hurting the people around however it appears that at least russian soldiers of the ww1 civil war era kept their bayonets fixed to the rifle at all times see photos in the linked wikipedia page as well as many others while the overall length of the rifle was such that normally the bayonet was so high that it could not come into contact with anything outdoors and out of forrest still why keep it fixed
49494 sample us wwi liberty bond poster left and wwii war bond poster right source wikipedia financing world wars ii in the united states in reviewing the united states efforts to finance wwi and wwii debt through the sale of bonds discovered some interesting statistics when comparing the two which led to my question here in order to establish basis for comparison converted the us dollar value of total wwi liberty bonds sold into us dollars using this inflation calculator then also converted the total value of wwii war bonds sold in us dollars into us dollars the wwii figures dwarfed the wwi figures even after adjusting both for inflation so then factored in the us duration of the two wars wwi two years wwii four years and compared the numbers after dividing by the number of years of opportunity wwii still dwarfed wwi so next factored in the us population using for wwi and for wwii and calculated the percent of participation number of bond buyers in wwi and number of bond buyers in wwii compared to the total us populations in and wwii again far exceeded wwi in this category then compared the total dollar amount per person in dollars apportioned against the total populations in and and wwii topped wwi again finally factored the number of years of opportunity into the population to calculate the bond purchase dollar value in per person per year of opportunity wwii wins again have included below breakdown of all the calculations using annual us population data freely available from google and the inflation calculator previously mentioned and bond sales values from wikipedia also consulted investopedia wwi liberty bonds and wwii war bonds the us national archives encyclopedia com wwi liberty bonds financing world war ii and the federal reserve wwi liberty bonds federal reserves role during wwii to be fair the us liberty bond effort met its goals as glowingly indicated in the federal reserves report on liberty bonds however the other sources cited refer to the wwi liberty bond sales efforts as disappointing whether the wwi sales were success or not and they certainly appear to have been success the wwii participation rate and resulting money raised after adjusted for inflation and apportioned by population far exceeds the earlier wars results the methods for advertising the bonds in both wars were very similar including mass marketing through the media of the day plus drives with extremely popular celebrities in both wars but the results differed greatly what factors contributed to wwiis us bond sales results far exceeding those of wwi below are the numbers from my calculations wwi liberty bond statistics value sold billion value sold billion value sold year billion us population bond buyers total participation rate value sold person value sold person year wwii war bond statistics value sold billion value sold billion factor more total than wwi liberty bonds value sold yr billion factor more per year than wwi liberty bonds us population bond buyers total participation rate factor more participation than wwi liberty bonds value sold person factor more per person than wwi liberty bonds value sold person year factor more per person per year than wwi liberty bonds question all things being equal population years of opportunity sold bond value adjusted for inflation to dollars and with similar marketing strategies in both wars to sell the bonds what contributed to the higher participation rates and higher dollar contributions per capita in wwii over that of wwi has there been an historical analysis of this phenomena see also wikipedia liberty bonds wikipedia series bonds war bonds update while numbers dont lie they can also be very misleading the numbers above are accurate and appear to indicate that wwis us bond drives were disappointment when compared to wwiis bond drives the answers below from lars bosteen and jms highlight important factors of the greater effectiveness of the broader mass marketing capabilities available in wwii through radio and greater familiarity with investing by the populace in wwii over wwi and more personal and emotional connection with the events that catapulted the us into wwii and the early setbacks in that war that galvanized steely resolve in americans as well as key factor brought out in the answer by pieter geerkens which deserves more upvotes being that the wwi drives achieved their goals and the bond issues were oversubscribed indicating had more been issued more would have sold which would have driven the wwi bond numbers higher numbers dont lie but they also dont tell the whole story the story is told well by the three answers thus far below can only accept one answer but all three are excellent and helpful
49521 radar jamming refers to rendering radar system ineffective by saturating it with noise typically by bombarding it with high intensity signal on the radars operating frequencyes in order to drown out any genuine returns in sea of noise early warning radars are radar installations designed as the name indicates to provide an early warning in case of attack during the cold war both the us and ussr deployed large networks of these radars to detect incoming bombers or missiles and give them time to retaliate given that blinding these radars would have placed the blinder at an enormous advantage over the blindee by rendering the blindee unable to detect or react in time to an incoming first strike why were there no us or soviet attempts at jamming each others early warning radars

49751 in the 1920s italy established the national fascist party italian partito nazionale fascista pnf hitler adopted much from his italian allies including their fascist ideals even the infamous straight armed salute was actually an old roman salute however hitlers group was called the national socialist german workers party german nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei abbreviated nsdap considering hitler appealed to the disenfranchised and downtrodden masses as germany was in rough shape at the time calling it the nsdap is fitting but socialism and fascism are on opposite sides of the political spectrum which eludes the latter answers to this older question did hitler get called fascist by his opponents within germany did he or other nazis have problem with that tell that the words fascist and fascism already projected negative image and was used to defame hitler and his nazi ideals but he and the entire nazi party were fascists werent they thats simply fact to slander hitler by calling him and his obviously fascist group fascist would just be redundant unless they never openly proclaim to being such cannot find single account by any actual nazi party member at the time claiming themselves fascist instead finding mostly socialist and nationalistic sentiments so did the german people under nazi rule openly identify as being fascist like italy or did they view themselves differently regardless if hitler knew they were

50270 over on wikipedia we find this cover from the march issue of soviet satire mag krokodil the person who uploaded it to wikipedia captioned it antisemitic caricature of rootless cosmopolitan on the talk page someone asks how is this image antisemitic does anyone mind explaining this to me thats my question too sure bet it is but can an expert explain it like im five it doesnt help that cant read russian and the image is so low quality that cant even transcribe or ocr it can make out the suitcase stickers that say sartre and sic lippmann and the caption which gloss as passportless vagabond cant make out the other stickers nor the scraps of paper sticking out of the tramps backpack nor the presumably significant quotation below the caption which probably clarifies the whole thing can someone transcribe and translate these for me also suspect that there is significance in the mismatched patterns of our vagabonds jacket and pants his weird little black and white embroidered bib and the knife in his belt both the knife and the walking stick have been turned into pen nibs by the cartoonist and possibly the hat and the overstuffed valise for that matter what would russian in have understood these symbols to mean
50275 am not asking about any resolution he might have made in the feverish april of do we have any information how hitler imagined the government of his reich after he would have died from old age did he wish to appoint specific successor produce an heir or would they transition to some form of rule other than one person dictatorship note my question is not duplicate of this it asks about who would have succeeded hitler had he died before and ring is definitely not the answer to my question as he was only four years hitlers junior
50369 came across an opinion of an alternative historian conspiracy theorist who claims that the defense of brest fortress did not make sense according to his theory its inhabitants should have left the fortress to the germans because counter offensive was planned for later stage as far as understand he thinks that the retreat of the red army in the early phases of the war was part of stalins strategy want to investigate whether or not his opinion may be true imagine that instead of trying to defend the brest fortress its inhabitants retreat without much bloodshed would the red army lose anything important compared to the real life scenario in which soviet troops defended the fortress for days until most of them were killed or same question in different words what exactly did the red army gain from the defence of the brest fortress my answer hypothesis defense of the brest fortress did not make any sense argument in support of the hypothesis all other soviet units in its vicinity either retreated or were destroyed by the germans the germans could advance eastwards regardless of whether they seized the fortress or not arguments against the hypothesis in wikipedia found the following text the fortress and the city controlled the crossings over the bug river as well as the warsaw moscow railway and highway if this is true then the germans could not use the bug river and the warsaw moscow railway as transportation channels as long as the fortress was not captured update this argument has been refuted by pnuts but the strategic objectives control over the panzerrollbahn the road to moscow the important railway line and the bridges over the bug river were accomplished the very first day of the war source wikipedia article mentioned above

50503 the question has there ever been military combat going on around an active running or in outage but not decommissioned commercial nuclear power plant or dangerously near it if yes how did the plant and its personnel fare in such situation why ask lets assume for the scope of this question modern commercial nuclear power plants candu pwr bwr of generation ii plus all of gen iii and newer are usually reasonably safe to operate given that the engineering has been done right and there is whole cohort of very well trained personnel on site at all times well rested and with considerable resources on their hands things hard to get with an armed conflict like the recent syrian war raging around cant seem to find any reference or comprehensive article about this hence this question edit to clarify alex asks how far is near as far or near as it gets for the plant operations to be affected for example if there was front thousand kilometers away but all operators were drafted into military forces the power plat would be affected on the other hand the km distance in ukraine is point of debate under the question below since the military action was feared to affect the zhaporizhia nuclear power plant but in the end it didnt mentions nonoperational power plants being swept in conflict as im interested in the operations being affected nonoperational power plants are not considered langlangc mike scott and others wanted clarification on why only commercial and not military installations the reasoning is that military installations are built for the purpose of military conflict either conducting or preventing it and thus are built supplied and run with an armed conflict in mind modern civilian nuclear power plants are built to withstand certain level of direct attack but that is not what ask about today we get reports on war in real time with video and picture in high resolution over whatsapp facebook and similar which means even under direct siege the civilian infrastructure works at least to degree hospitals are low on personnel and materials but still run albeit more basic service nuclear power plants are the greatest risk to populace when run without the required care but requirements for power supply may under circumstances override standard safety requirements at the same time it is impossible to run third of nuclear power plant but it is difficult to predict where the line is im interested in instances of civil commercial power station operations being affected whether there at all was such an instance and what lessons can be learned from it for civilian not directly involved in operations but wanting an insight and understanding second edit large water reservoirs have been mentioned repeatedly which may help define this question another bit better because there is one crucial difference between nuclear and other power generation modi and that is what wanted to ask about admit havent worded the original question very clearly and im sorry about that you can attack dam or nuclear reactor with missile or hijacked airplane and cause considerable damage you can even attack high rise building and cause unprecedented damage casualties and long term aftereffects throughout the human society this doesnt single out the nuclear operations from other terror or military targets and the extent of damage is off topic in the scope of this question what does single the nuclear operation out as point of interest is the fact that nuclear power plant cant be left without the many highly and very specifically trained personnel operating it even when the reactor is shut down as quickly as possible without compromising its safety which fact makes it easy to compromise the safety of nuclear power station with seemingly unrelated action confiscating all buses or simply setting up checkpoint in the area may lead to number of important people missing their shift which in turn may lead to overworking operators who are already stressed out by the whole situation to the best of my knowledge this doesnt apply to other means of power generation or in broader sense infrastructure operations or when yes the possible consequences are not as dire as with nuclear power generation
50549 just read comment that implied that law that hadn been used in while was no longer relevant which made me curious as to what was the oldest unused us law that could still be considered relevant not things like witchcraft or drinking after dark which would be judged to have been overridden by later laws immediately thought of the 3rd amendment no quartering of soldiers has the us government military ever tried to violate the 3rd and if so when
50644 im working story currently and ran into what could be time management issue in my story have young woman late teens early 20s walking from her home to town having promised she would be back that same day however am now crunching numbers to make sure did not over estimate her walking speed keep in mind this is young lady that is part of well off family to give an idea of what she would be wearing and while walking leisurely was common in this time in england would the distance of six miles in north central england be something she was confident she could do quickly most of the estimates of time can find say it would take about hours to walk that distance so that is four hours if we count the return trip allowing her to plan for maybe couple of hours in town for story reasons she does not do the trip back just want to know if her plan would have been possible thanks everyone
50649 apologies in advance not being american while ive read up somewhat about the military aspects of the civil war am somewhat unclear as to its political dimension lincoln did not declare the slaves free until despite his personal beliefs did he wait because he was not sure of the political support in the north for accepting abolition as war aim along with stopping secession or did he wait to preserve the possibility of negotiations with the confederacy if it was the second reason is there any indication of what he was willing to compromise on if the first what changed yes ive seen what is the context of lincoln saying if could save the union without freeing any slave would do it but it doesnt tell me why he waited and what got him to commit to abolition
50723 joel mokyr writes in demand vs supply in the industrial revolution that the determination of when where and how fast are to be sought first and foremost in supply not demand related process am confused as to what is meant by supply and demand in this case what are specific examples of supply side explanations would it be similar to the argument that supply creates its own demand due to overproduction leading to excess inventory and price drops any help on understanding the terminology would be great

50881 thereve been many wars in which the side known as the north conquered the one known as the south three kingdoms period in china the northern kingdom conquered the two southern ones the northern southern dynasties period in china also ended with northern dynasty conquering the south vietnam war north vietnam conquered south vietnam american civil war the union north conquered the confederacy south korean war stalemate im curiously unable to think of war which ended in southern victory has there been such war to clarify im most interested for north vs south wars here an event such as germanys conquest of norway in ww2 although it is case of southern invader conquering northern country isnt actually north vs south war because its multi front there was also an eastern front western front etc

50955 it would seem pretty logical addition to wwii battle group to have one of more tugs for the capital ships heck any ship yet dont see much evidence of that let me elaborate was an army officer for support company if recall correctly it was long time ago we had several wreckers whose jobs was to retrieve tanks or other vehicles that had been disabled couple were fully armored and capable of towing the heavy tanks of the day m60a3 and m1 just introduced under fire if necessary have been reading about several incidents in wwii involving us capital ships yorktown hornet and chicago they were crippled and trying to make it to safer waters of the ships only the chicago was ever towed by tugboat the equivalent of my wrecker and not at first without tugboat ships like the yorktown could only be towed at knots but hear of navajo class tugs with speeds better than knots under load havent been able to find source but would think it much better than knots considering how important capital ships were especially carriers like hornet and yorktown why wasnt there tug or two handy in the event they became disabled seems like in the case of yorktown especially speedy evacuation could have saved her in addition using tug would mean freeing another ship to continue the fight why werent there tugs available at midway santa cruz or other confrontations where they might have been able to quickly take other ships to safer waters tia

51230 remember reading something along those lines perhaps in the de bello gallico can anyone provide source material to confirm this edit think the claim was also that the tribes there were somewhat nomadic in nature or at least didnt settle anywhere for too long in fear of becoming soft or something like that edit2 strabo vii all these nations easily change their abode on account of the scantiness of provisions and because they neither cultivate the lands nor accumulate wealth but dwell in miserable huts and satisfy their wants from day to day the most part of their food being supplied by the herd as amongst the nomade races and in imitation of them they transfer their households in waggons wandering with their cattle to any place which may appear most advantageous that sounds like it but dont think its the one im looking for recall specifically something about taking pride in not cultivating the land sources wiki perseus
51246 listening to the audiobook day through german eyes thought what if germany had surrendered before any soviet force entered its territory in the book german soldier says that his motivation after was to protect his motherland from communist enslavement hence thought that maybe from this standpoint it would have been better to concentrate resistance on the eastern border and let western forces invade deeper was there any predetermined arrangement official or non official to divide its territory into sectors in the case of western powers occupying the whole of the country before the soviets managed to enter it would the soviet sector have covered less ground than it did in actual history or would it have been the same and there was no benefit from letting western forces advance deeper my question is not about whether there was any possibility of conditional surrender or of surrender to only some of the allies im curious whether it was possible to escape communist rule by re distributing the resistance effort to the east
51279 note this is question about railway mounted artillery not about armored trains which were more akin to tanks on rails and had much smaller guns the idea behind railway gun is quite sound bigger gun is better than small gun but it is harder to relocate but if we will use trains that can carry lots of weight relatively quickly then we can put really big guns on them and move them around with ease but the effect is far from expected because the railway artillery requires lots of maintenance and logistics might have problems with aiming in other direction than straight ahead of the tracks and the number of shots per day is simply pathetic for example the famous dora no not that one required people to assemble the gun in days to lay the tracks and flak battalions to protect it from the air attacks and in return it was providing shots per day all this looks horribly inefficient when compared to for example ww ii bombers or even smaller ww heavy artillery like the famous big bertha which could fire shots per hour although indeed with times lighter shell so were ever those white elephants of modern weapons even critical in winning any battle or were there just drain on the resource that could be better spent on different kind of weaponry edit ive removed the winning part since indeed it had not much sense boats were critical in the battle of atlantic yet the battle was won by allies so in other words am looking for battles where railway guns have played very significant role no matter on the final outcome
51280 im reading an historical fiction novel new york by edward rutherfurd at the moment one of the early chapters set in new amsterdam new york city in the mid 17th century is told from the perspective of slave owned by dutchman this dutch slaveowner is depicted as kind slaveowner some specific details the slaves role appears to be as domestic servant and labourer his tasks are fetching things opening doors for guests waiting on guests running errands around town the slave is never whipped except once as child where he is whipped alongside the slaveowners son when they broke window when the slaveowner rents the slave out to others he gives some of the money he recieves to the slave as child the slave plays with the slaveowners children the slaveowner agrees to free the slave and his family wife and son when the slaveowner dies what im wondering is this depiction of slavery accurate and commonplace enough for the time and culture or is this fanciful writing
51326 not long after hitler was appointed chancellor opposition groups began to shut down he of course had already criminalised the communist kpd and alleged sympathisers but was astonished to learn that many other parties closed themselves voluntarily in the weeks before hitler shut down opposition via legal edict the ddp dnvp and dvp closed themselves down at the end of june and the catholic zentrum and its allies in the early days of july the dnvp was fairly close to the nazi agenda and the zentrum also had sympathies in that direction and were apparently losing membership however in the election after hitler had been confirmed as chancellor the nazis still only won around of the vote it would seem at this point then that there was still significant number of germans perhaps close to half who did not support the nazis why then were other parties happy to close voluntarily was it fear of political violence given that the nazis essentially controlled the army and police as well as their own paramilitary wing was there real sense that german political sympathy was shifting overwhelmingly behind the nazis or something else
51366 ive just listened to the short bbc news audio podcast clip how british academics spied on the superpowers tim brien from the jodrell bank radio telescope discusses year old recordings which show how britain monitored soviet space missions and shared the findings with the soviet union he does indeed describe something more like assistance than spying my attempt at transcription the russians used to send jodrell all the coordinates and the frequencies they were using so that we could track these spacecraft and of course we would then announce this to the world and suppose in part maybe verify that they were really doing what they claimed to be doing because when people would claim that they weren really technologically capable of doing this because there was obviously big political battle between these two superpowers so it had this sort of role even to the extent that jodrell would track the spacecraft and record the signals on to tape and russian would fly into ringway airport in manchester as it was then and someone from here would drive up get off the plane and hand them tape and they head off to moscow with that recording was this purely scientific camaraderie pardon the pun or inter government cooperation or something else clearly the soviet unions space program benefited from both data and pr did the uk benefit as well

51432 have there been cases where sovereign communist government ran in an open and fair multi party election and conceded loss the reason for the sovereign qualifier is simple if for example the indian state of kerala has communist government it stands to reason that as part of india it could not assuming it even wanted to cancel elections or manipulate them overmuch the federal indian government would not let it also the communist government in my question need not have been elected into power it just needs to have allowed free elections once it had power edit the notion of agency or free choice in allowing elections is important too eastern europe in was imploding people were fleeing through newly opened borders and gorbachev refused military backing people like honecker deserve praise for not ordering their troops to shoot with uncertain outcomes cf romania but its not so much that they believed in democracy its that they had run out of all other options edit for the purposes of the question communist party is one which calls itself communist or whose party manifesto explicitly indicates its adherence to marxist leninist principles
51496 when the portuguese royal court over souls fled the napoleonic invasion of portugal in and installed itself in rio de janeiro brazil rio became the capital of the pluricontinental lusitanian monarchy until this is one of the few instances in history that the capital of colonising country officially shifted to city in one of its colonies from wikipedia what are the other instances referred to in the above paragraph when and where edit thought had so phrased my question that it would convey exactly what meant it to it seems however that to city in one of its colonies sounds ambiguous to some by that mean to another country to city or place outside the borders of the colonising country naturally it has to be colony if the head of state moves or flees to london and tries to rule his country from there that is not what im looking for edit ii definition of colony country or area under the full or partial political control of another country and occupied by settlers from that country

51855 when did humans start to keep track of years with unique identifiers for each year assume that the realization that seasons were cyclic came first and that at some point we decided to call each cycle year assume this happened before the discovery of how the solar system worked since its easier to notice season cycles than rotations around the sun assume it was at some later point that we decided to give each of those years unique identifier number to help keep track of things my questions is when was that later point when did we start numbering the years to keep track of them who did it first how did they do it arbitrary number years since notable event also when did large portion of population become aware of this the numbering if you ask pretty much anybody today theyll be able to tell you what year it is no matter their walks of life but guess that when people first started numbering years it was most useful to certain members of the population and inconsequential for others therefore some people might have been unaffected and unaware of the current year
51877 are there or have there been any cultures in which women uncover and treat their own breasts in much the same way that some men treat their own beards either with pride or as display of adulthood and or attractiveness without discouragement from their society many women in the proudly display their breasts via deep cleavage but there are two reasons they dont meet my criteria in most places in the women have to cover their areolas and nipples showing that their society still doesnt accept breasts much of their society views exposure sometimes even without visible areola as scandalous or inappropriate and im especially but not only curious if this was ever practiced in the context of coming of age celebration

52252 while researching genealogy discovered that one of my ancestors had registration affidavit of alien enemy document on file it is dated january and includes his fingerprints immigration information he was german immigrant and living situation im aware that there was anti german prejudice at the time in the united states due to world war which is why he is labeled as an alien enemy but im unsure as to what this document actually means is it merely stating that hes german immigrant without otherwise commenting on him is it saying that he was specifically identified as an individual who was hostile to americans perhaps through his speech or actions was he under individual suspicion for being german sympathizer what does this registration affidavit of alien enemy document actually mean
52262 the american government put lot of effort into convincing the american populace to purchase wwii bonds but did american citizens have good alternatives for investment during the same years for example was it more lucrative to purchase stocks or non government bonds instead or perhaps war bonds were good deal and the government only needed to convince the populace to consider investing in the first place
52334 in his answer to recent question on whether there had been viking exchange between europe and the americas langlangc brings up that the king of norway offered polar bear to henry the 3rd in and that another such polar bear made its way to the sultan of egypt via emperor frederik earlier that century the official historic royal palaces website adds this nugget although it was kept muzzled and chained the bear was allowed to swim and hunt for fish in the thames collar and stout cord were attached to the bear to keep it from escaping insofar as understand male polar bears range from 700kg and measure 3m and females are about half that size and im not aware of any reason why that might have changed much in the past thousand years its medieval zookeepers would have been about an inch shorter on average than we are today even in the best of scenarios small female polar bear is comparable in size and weight to typical adult male black bear so id imagine they were captured and tamed while still cubs still im somewhat struggling to make any sense of how one would go about with muzzling an adult polar bear without tranquilizer except perhaps one dead or injured zookeeper at time is there any documentation anywhere on how they were handling the beasts more specifically on how theyd get the muzzle on without anyone getting injured or worse

52471 after the ottoman empire collapsed why did turkey its successor state retain control of the empires balkan holdings considering the historical origins of the empire turkey should have gotten its holdings in anatolia and asia minor while istanbul and the balkans should have been given to greece after all constantinople had been the seat of the eastern roman empire for about millennium looking at the map now turkey literally holds what used to be the territories of the byzantines dont like that word myself

52521 in the comments to another question another user of history se made remarkable if unbelievable claim actually germany was shocked when the us declared war and entered on the side of great britain the entry of the us quickly brought an exhausted germany but not as exhausted as england france and russia to its knees the germans wouldnt find out why the us had suddenly and inexplicably entered the war until they were sitting around the table at the treaty of versailles and yes wwii began at that table what the germans discovered was so shocking that it shocks us still indeed if know my stackexchange ill bet their discovery was so shocking the mods will ban you for repeating it naturally was intrigued having studied those peace negotiations wondered what it was that could possibly have shocked that german delegation and this user the reply was well im talking about the balfour declaration of which the germans had no knowledge until versailles wherein the british who controlled palestine at the time promised group of jewish financiers including german jews the land of palestine in return for bringing the us into the war against germany viola my source is benjamin freedman who claims to have been involved with the versailles negotiations from speech he gave in dc in in essence benjamin freedman claims that america had been tricked into joining world war one on the side of the allies by zionists in return for the promise of palestine and that the balfour declaration was kind of receipt for services rendered suggested that the user post question citing his source and asking whether there was any evidence to support mr freedmans claims unfortunately rather than doing so the user posted something rather different nonetheless the question has been raised and as historians we should endeavour to answer it so is there any evidence to support the claims made by benjamin freedman in his speech and repeated in comments here on this site
52539 background the fall of rome the roman empire collapsed as political entity in several stages during the 5th 6th and 7th century ce specifically these are the crossing of the rhine by the germanic tribes that could not be repelled in the abandonment of britania shortly after ce the collapse of the defense of the empire in italy against alarics band of warriors that would later form the visigoths and the subsequent sack of rome in ce the takeover of various parts of the western section of the empire by the visigoths western gaul and iberia the vandals iberia nort africa the suebi iberia the burgundians eastern gaul the ostrogoths italy and the consequent loss of territorial cohesion of the western part of the empire the takeover of the italian heart of the empire by germanic mercenaries gradually from the incident in formally in when the last western roman emperor was deposed notably the eastern roman emperor nominally stull retained suzeranity over the entire empire there were also still remnant provinces soissons and mauretania deep inside western roman territory that were still governed by roman officials though they were probably not in contact with the roman emperor the remaining eastern roman one the destruction of the roman navy by the vandals notably the eastern roman one in the battle of cap bon in but they did of course also destroy the western roman fleet the inability of justinians the eastern roman army to secure the reconquered italy given that this was the symbolic and historic heart of the empire as well as the seat of the pope this is kind of big deal the collapse of the defense of the empire in the east and the occupation of egypt by khosrow ii in the utter inability of the resist the attack of the caliphate in the 7th century in northern africa the levante and subsequently the mediterranean islands egypt being taken by an army that was only strong the loss of the roman political institutions the consulship being allowed to lapse in the early 500s other republican and military titles dux judex caesar comes etc etc transformed into feudal nobility titles the institution of the emperor transformed from nominal princeps of the republic in the tradition of caesar and augustus to that of god given kingdom and actually styled himself king not imperator or as before the demise of the roman civil administration especially in italy due to years of chaos in the early langobard era and elsewhere the collapse of the economy the infrastructure the population urban areas the city of romes population declined from million to few thousands etc for more data than in the wikipedia pages see ward perkins book the fall of rome and the end of civilization the end of the pax romana some of these events were more symbolic and though politically relevant had little bearing on the lives of ordinary people however the collapse of the economy the infrastructure the decline of the population etc must have been felt and must have had terrible consequences for everyone this is documented to some detail in ward perkins book the fall of rome and the end of civilization question what did the romans think about this although the process stretching across more than centuries was slow it must have been evident to most contemporaries so what did they think about this to what extent did they anticipate this do we have sources attesting to that note that these questions are so closely interconnected that it does not make sense to open seperate questions here on history se what found so far unfortunately found very little about this so far one example is apparently paulus orosius writing about the sack of rome in as described by ward perkins book the fall of rome and the end of civilization the christian apologist orosius for instance wrote history against the pagans in in which he set himself the unenviable task of proving that despite the disasters of the early fifth century the pagan past had actually been worse than the troubled christian present in describing the gothic sack of rome in orosius did not wholly deny its unpleasantness which he attributed to the wrath of god on rome sinful inhabitants but he also dwelt at length on the respect shown by the goths for the christian shrines and saints of the city and he claimed that the events of were not as bad as two disasters that had occurred during pagan times the sack of rome by the gauls in bc and the burning and despoiling of the city under the nero ward perkins is not actually primarily interested in how romans perceived their impending decline but in showing that the fall of the empire was actually bad in economic terms accompanied by collapse of wealth of population size and of the technology level orosius own account history against the pagans book vii and following takes the attitude to propose that everything is not as bad as it looks and that whatever bad things occur do so as the instrument of the just and understandable wrath of god in his own words for how does it harm christian who is longing for eternal life to be withdrawn from this world at any time or by any means on the other hand what gain is it to pagan who though living among christians is hardened against faith if he drag out his days little longer since he whose conversion is hopeless is destined at last to die orosius history against the pagans book vii and in view of these things am ready to allow christian times to be blamed as much as you please if you can only point to any equally fortunate period from the foundation of the world to the present day my description think has shown not more by words than by my guiding finger that countless wars have been stilled many usurpers destroyed and the most savage tribes checked confined incorporated or annihilated with little bloodshed no real struggle and almost without loss it remains for our detractors to repent of their endeavors to blush on seeing the truth and to believe to fear to love and to follow the one true god who can do all things and all of whose acts even those that they have thought evil they have found to be good orosius history against the pagans book vii in the second quote orosius ominously insinuates that one might think that all this misfortune is happening in response to the recent conversion to christianity the empire had gradually become christian state over the century leading up to the sack of the city he does not mention or cite anyone who acutally made that argument but his addressing it might indicate that there are writers that do or alternatively that it was at least conceivable to ancient romans of that time and good bit more logical than his own interpretation it also indicates that he was aware of decline of civilization of some sort unfolding around him although he was determined to ignore and deny it kind of the previously deposed western roman emperor julius nepos was stil around until

52647 iranian women are now always portrayed as oppressed in the media and social media compared to the 1970s expected their situation to be similar to that for women in saudi arabia but after reading little bit about the islamic revolution in iran in was little shocked to learn that women had the right to vote work and attend school and university womens resistance included remaining in the work force in large numbers and challenging islamic dress by showing hair under their head scarves the iranian government has had to reconsider and change aspects of its policies towards women because of their resistance to laws that restrict their rights the regime succeeded in putting women back in the veil in public places but not in resocializing them into fundamentalist norms iranian revolution wikipedia believe ayatollah khomeini wanted completely islamic state so how could women still have such rights am not convinced that the iranian government couldnt have forced women out of the workforce nor that it couldnt make an example of women who challenged them
52672 ive just finished reading sword and scimitar by simon scarrow and wanted to know more about the non fictional characters in the siege of malta jean parisot de la valette was the grand master and he survived all hardships of the siege he died in but im not sure how the wikipedia article jean parisot de valette says he had stroke while praying in chapel and then died few days later on august was also reading the great siege of malta article and it says something different he died in hunting accident also saw another article on de valette at http josfamilyhistory com which just says he died peacefully in his sleep how did he die
52680 xenophon of athens created large amount of written material even by todays standards did he create this work knowing it would be read by future generations or was it for his own satisfaction could imagine figures like socrates aristotle or herodotus might expect their work to be copied many times but maybe not is this similar to academia where document or book might be highly useful to smaller audience even in this case the physical effort to create and copy the work seems trivial compared to the same with papyrus and copying by hand
52682 the concept of media that is enjoyable because its incompetently executed is big market nowadays movies probably have the biggest examples plan from outer space troll the room samurai cop just to name handful of famous examples but the concept also exists in videogames books television and even the occasional piece of music what im interested in and havent found any proof of is how far has this concept gone say during shakespeares time were there theater troupes that managed to attract audiences by doing terrible performances or pennydreadful writer at the turn of the century that did such poor job of it that people bought the books just to see they were as bad as everybody claimed or famous preacher that delivered such rambling sermons that the congregation came just to laugh just anecdotally the earliest example im aware of is plan which was made in the 1950s but even that only got catapulted to fame in the 1980s by getting called out by modern critic the eye of argon is the earliest have for when the notoriety started in the 1970s starting shortly after writing but thats still very recent my amateur research seems to indicate that this trend really only started in the last years or so but cant think of definitive reason why it couldnt have happened sooner are there any earlier examples of this phenomenon
52694 from what know developed countries seem to have stayed developed or at least recovered quickly even if there was devastating war germany after ww2 if its indeed the case that developed countries tend to stay developed wonder why in other endeavours such as sports if one does not practice ones skill decreases quickly that would seem to indicate that getting to developed state is hard but getting undeveloped is easy besides if its easy for formerly developed state to become developed again quickly that should also indicate that currently developing countries should be able to develop quickly and thats clearly not the case the easiest explanation is that my knowledge is wrong is it were there any developed countries that became undeveloped for reasons other than war
52739 am wondering if any of this is true hammett the maltese falcon the archives of the order from the twelfth century on are still at malta they are not intact but what is there holds no less than three he held up three fingers referenees that cant be to anything else but this jeweled falcon in delaville le roulxs les archives de lordre de saint jean there is reference to it oblique to be sure but reference still and the unpublished because unfinished at the time of his death supplement to paolis dell origine ed instituto del sacro militar ordine has clear and unmistakable statement of the facts am telling you all right spade said all right sir grand master villiers de lisle dadam had this foothigh jeweled bird made by turkish slaves in the castle of st angelo and sent it to charles who was in spain he sent it in galley commanded by french knight named cormier or corvere member of the order his voice dropped to whisper again it never reached spain he smiled with compressed lips and asked you know of barbarossa redbeard khair ed din no famous admiral of buccaneers sailing out of algiers then well sir he took the knights galley and he took the bird the bird went to algiers thats fact thats fact that the french historian pierre dan put in one of his letters from algiers googling just turns up page after page about movie props clarification this question asks specifically the details about the falcon starting with bare existance addition book by pierre dan unknown whether it contains the relevant letter more it is not clear exactly how hammett got his material he is not known to have read french medieval or otherwise or italian his references must have been gleaned from secondary source have been unable to locate simple narrative of the rental agreement between the hospitallers of st john and charles of spain that hammett would have had available to him with all of the detail gutman provides think there must be one but what is clear nonetheless is that hammett was reading widely carefully and thoughtfully
52741 saw this question asked on twitter today at first blush it seemed like an easy reference question but cant find any place that actually has this spelled out in one place ended up having to do lot of research and still lots of folks came up with answers didnt think about so perhaps this question can be that place feel free to add any qualifying languages that arent listed to the wiki answer below for the purposes of the question id like to stick to standard accepted boundaries of europe and not to include languages that only appeared due to late modern migration eg arabic in germany also of course no dead languages sorry etruscan we miss you
52754 dont understand the concept of principalities why wouldnt you just call yourself king the job description appears to be exactly the same when england was ruled by the saxons we had bunch of kings who slowly all got defeated and the winner declared the old king eorls thegn gesiths take your pick is it when an empire got too big to manage the king set his sons off to manage chunks and over time they became more autonomous tried to google but all could find really were about the bible and demons one article about wales looked really promising but it just seemed to be an extract about book looked at the proposed duplicate how were nobles promoted in aristocracies better example is queen victoria deciding to become empress of all india after her daughter became empress of germany know it is politically more complicated than that really this thread doesnt answer my question as principalities werent under king who had given them their title and who they owed fealty to principalities are top of their own pile somebody has answered my question with the russian tsar example have just read the other suggested link why is the heir to the british throne called prince of wales and the fact that prince actually means leader is very interesting
52777 before the widespread use of firearms various kinds of plate armour were in widespread use as muskets and later rifles became widespread full plate became less effective and fell out of use however mortars and later cannon did exist firing exploding shells unit formations would be changed depending on whether the enemy had artillery or not because tightly packed formation would suffer greater casualties from well placed shell shrapnel was very much feature of battles named after henry shrapnel of course with this in mind why was body armour so rarely used even the most basic armour would have reduced casualties more curiously still effective steel helmets were replaced with caps or leather helmets such as shakos which are more decorative than protective steel was still relatively expensive but not unreasonably so and wrought iron plate was in mass production at the outbreak of wwi the high number of casualties with head wounds led to swift adoption of helmets such as the adrian helmet other body armour was tried as well with varying degrees of success but helmets were clear win the only innovative aspect of wwi helmets was that they were pressed from single steel sheet which made them cheaper to manufacture as far as their basic design went they were functionally indistinguishable from helmets of the middle ages failing to equip your troops to keep them alive could perhaps be understood if combat effectiveness was allowed to degrade during peacetime however in period covering the napoleonic wars the american civil war and the maintenance of empires around the globe by the various european powers this clearly is not the case why did it take years for the value of effective helmets and body armour to be recognised and how could the combined militaries of the world forget that it existed for years updated following comment by steve bird ive seen this question already and dont think it answers my question as answers to that question say the issue with shields is that using them effectively takes serious training the same applies for fighting in full plate armour too whilst im not hema player im sure it takes some practise to ignore sword strikes to your extremities and trust in your armour this is not the case for helmets and light breastplates though theyre simple to put on they give decent passive protection and apart from getting used to the weight they dont affect anything else also on another comment by steve bird the scope may seem to be wide but in fact it applies through the entire 19th century whilst the guns available are radically different from muskets and smooth bore cannons at the start of the century to recognisably modern rifles and artillery at the end of the century the uniforms worn by soldiers were unchanged throughout headgear in particular is clearly fashion statement and is not designed for personal protection im curious why thats the case when keeping yourself alive would seem to be more of priority and even if keeping your troops alive is not your top priority why anyone would start outfitting them with shakos or pith helmets which do cost money instead of simple helmet
52791 ive been doing lot of reading up about the three kingdoms warlord era of china and cao cao stuck out to me as an interesting name after some research found that the words in chinese are different and there is slight pronunciation difference cao caos given name apparently roughly means virtuous conduct although it looks as though the character could also translate to the slang form to mean ck it can be assumed this wasnt the intention of his parents in ancient china and the general consensus from that wikipedia discussion confirms this the other thing gained from that discussion was that the family name cao really has no meaning and stems from the state of cao but because the family background of cao caos father is very hazy the connection to the first prominent person to bear the name cao cao can is iffy but the two families are probably connected the worrying thing from that wikipedia discussion is the lack of citations so was hoping to affirm the points that were in there the other question have is whether or not there was any recorded or reasonably theorized reason of why he would have been named cao the other part to this is whether or not anything addresses the similarity between his two names have absolutely no idea if there is reasonable answer to the question but im also just interested to hear theories based on whatever evidence we do have preferably with more citations than on the wikipedia discussion page

52922 im currently on my lunch break and deep in the wikipedia hole which brought me to this article that details thwarted nuclear smuggling incidents in many of the incidents involve elements that would not be useful for the production of nuclear dirty weapon but minority of them involve significant quantities of plutonium enriched uranium working on the assumption that only fraction of these smuggling attempts were busted this suggests that quite large amount of material potentially enough for nuclear warhead and certainly enough to make dirty bomb probably made its way in to the wrong hands im not aware of any incidents of nuclear terrorism since then so suppose my question is who was buying it and why hasnt it turned up since
52978 were alexander the great and hephaestion lovers since there are no historical shreds of evidence that alexander regarded hephaestion as someone more than friend are the modern claims only based on the fact that said he was only defeated by hephaestions thighs edit id be glad to know the reason behind down voting this question
53024 if were tourist planning to visit all the major cities in europe which languages would be most beneficial for me to know nowadays the answer would be straightforward as many people in europe speak english as their secondary language maybe throw in some german and french and you should be fine but if this were my question wouldn ask it here would just google the answer interested in the prevalence of languages in 19th century europe specifically the end of the 19th century know that travelling abroad wasn as common back then as it is today but assume that there were still lot of people who travelled the continent on regular basis be it for political scientific or economic reasons that why would like to know which languages would be the most useful in order to get by in 19th century europe assume that most working class people only spoke one language so it might be relevant to know which languages were learned by educated people at that time tried to research this topic on my own unfortunately only found information about the current situation in europe no historical data about languages in general specific knowledge about the development of english and french at that time were available but not in the context of other european languages presume that english is still strong contender for number one language but think other languages have good chance as well also included languages like latin in my research which had more significance in the past so to sum up my question which languages were the most useful for travelling europe in the late 19th century as suggested in the comments will narrow my query down to one specific scenario the person in question would be diplomat or trader and travel the continent on regular basis doing so he or she would meet many educated and influential people the main mode of transport would be by train and he or she would spend most time in capitals or other big cities not in rural areas
53146 have question about some paragraph in finkelsteins holocaust industry he writes that some years back the parody of new york tabloid was headlined michael jackson million others die in nuclear holocaust the letters page carried an irate protest by elie wiesel how dare people refer to what happened yesterday as holocaust there was only one holocaust this passage is from the 2nd paperback edition pages my question what publication was that and was the letter by wiesel itself parody or real letter written by him finkelstein provides footnotes for quite lot of things unfortunately not for this one
53199 this ruler was originally handed down to an aunt on my english mothers side of the family one side is standard ruler in inches but curiously the other side is unlike anything ive been able to find on google images one side has inches many such such rulers can be found on the internet the other side seems to be for prices lettering includes presumably pounds shillings pence this close up shows and on one section then and on the other resolution and contrast are not ideal the faint numbers in the column between the very clear and on the upper half appear to be the wooden folding ruler also shown here is rabone boxwood of no particular value or interest think the earliest known owner was great aunt born died we dont know who if anyone owned it before her or how she obtained it nor do we know anything about her other than that she had several brothers and that she never married this great aunts father was member of friba fellow of the royal institute of british architects the ruler is ivory and has in tiny letters on one side the name joseph mackness it is unclear if this the manufacturer googling hasnt turned up any manufacturers of this name or the original owner there are some people by the joseph mackness on ancestry com but none seem to fit the likely time frame victorian or edwarding and there are no known macknesses in the family given the numerous examples of ivory and bone folding rulers that can be found online many for different purposes professions it is puzzling that cant find any examples with and lsd this might indicate that it is quite rare which seems strange if its function was related to prices presumably many thousands of shopkeepers customs officers etc would have found it useful which means it shouldnt be rare one explanation suggested by family member is that it is presentation item souvenir or retirement gift never intended for actual use was this folding ruler used by shopkeepers customs officers or some other profession or is it presentation item or souvenir id also be interested if anyone could put narrower date range on it than think victorian to edwardian
53215 addis ababa is the capital of ethiopia its name means new flower in amharic and the tale of how it got its name is told thus the location of addis ababa was chosen by the empress taytu betul and the city was founded by the emperor menelik ii in in while empress taytu betul admired the landscape she saw flower of remarkable beauty she fell in love and asker her husband emperor menelik ii to build her house in the area she named it addis ababa and the rest is year old history so my question is what was the flower of empress taytu that she saw there and named the city after
53235 during world war ii something like one half of lend lease supplies reached russia via vladivostok and the trans siberian railroad what call the eastern route one quarter to south russia from the persian gulf the southern route and one quarter through archangelsk from britain the western route the last was the shortest route but the most dangerous because convoys had to pass german controlled norway through short time window specifically archangelsk was ice bound several months year also convoys could not run mid year because the days were too long giving free reign to german bombers and submarines was it possible to avoid some of these problems by approaching archangelsk from the east that is from alaska instead of scotland or was it matter that if the eastern route was used it was easier to ship goods by train from vladivostok than over the white sea in the north note under their non aggression pact with japan the soviets were allowed to import food and raw materials but not arms through vladivostok archangelsk city in the north of european russia

53343 looking at the current political and cultural scene in many societies one sees pattern of tension between on one hand modernists and progressives who see themselves as moving forward and being on the right side of history part of some hegelian historical process that is almost inevitable and on the other hand conservatives and traditionalists who see the new values and cultural norms being imposed on them as aberrant and irrational and wish to return their society or community back to the way it was decades or centuries before consider for example gay marriage there are those who ideally would like to go back to where marriage was between man and woman they want to reverse the changes that were brought about by the lgbtq movement but wonder has any such reversal ever been achieved before are there any historical cases were there was definite move towards new ideological or cultural direction which then got reversed by elements of the society which wished to return the old ways im tempted to say that the decline of various empires roman persian arab etc might be interpreted as such reversals but upon further thinking dont see anything specially ideological about those declines nor was any particular group pushing for some sort of reversal at the time were there such groups
53375 am very familiar with the story of the civil war and the various players in it have read the sources from livy suetonius to more modern authors but none has ever answered why caesar did not move against sextus before the latter was able to build his base of power possible answers have come up with were sextus was not yet that powerful and caesar possibly underestimated how influential he would become but think even this is not full answer caesar had obviously seen what pompeys children were capable of in africa and spain where he only narrowly avoided defeat additionally he had seen just how powerful the pompey name was in recruiting soldiers and allies especially in the areas like spain where pompey had his power bases because of these reasons sextus eventually became major problem for augustus it seems foolish for caesar to depart for parthia while he still had sextus on his flank running around free what was caesars reason for this
53428 at any time in world history has there ever been two nations involved in cold war similar to the one between the and and notably including proxy wars my thanks to lars bosteen who pointed out that wikipedia defines cold war as follows cold war is state of conflict between nations that does not involve direct military action but is pursued primarily through economic and political actions propaganda acts of espionage or proxy wars waged by surrogates that article while defining cold war to include proxy wars waged by surrogates includes references to other cold wars that are merely defined by the existence of tension between nations in short it appears journalists and analysts are co opting the term despite insufficient conditions to warrant its use its only my opinion and if youll forgive bit of exaggeration but based on that use of the term the is in state of cold war with quite number of nations and the middle east has been in state of perpetual cold war another way of thinking about this has there ever been cold war fought through means including proxies that wasnt defined by the or their proxies clarification apologize that the preceding statements werent clear the wikipedia link provided by lars bosteen identify other cold wars but their definition appears to be more marketing than an appropriate use of the term as its being used to simply identify high tension between nations the definition provided by the link that cold war does not involve direct military action but is pursued primarily through economic and political actions propaganda acts of espionage or proxy wars waged by surrogates is generally satisfactory for me but to make the question clear am requiring proxy wars are there any known conditions of cold war using that definition other than between the and the
53429 there are many stories in religious books about abraham meeting pharaoh of egypt also jacob josef moses etc did any of these pharaohs believed in abrahamic religions was there any proof from the hieroglyphic writings that pharaohs believed in these religions was there any proof from the hieroglyphic writings that the prophets met the pharaohs or existed in these eras
53438 am reading about titus flavius sabinus consul ad and cannot find meaning of in his full name as written in wikipedia titus flavius sabinus all have found is list of roman consuls and military tribunes where similar abbreviations are used with various letters searching for tftn or returns modern abbreviations like thanks for the numbers the free times newspaper nothing relevant reading the wiki page history see no indication why this abbreviation was inserted my guess would be is abbreviation of province or military regiment
53447 did stalin kill all of the soviet officers involved in the winter war when it ended documentary called warlords hitler vs stalin made this claim but wikipedia doesnt seem to mention this actual quote from the film finally the finns were beaten but not before killing russian soldiers stalin sent in his political komissars to shoot the soviet commanders but the real fault was his own since there was no reference to any specific commanders the sentence implies some punitive systematic killing of soviet commanders
53573 having recently seen martello tower on the east coast of england tried to find out what the defensive strategy was supposed to be but the internet seems very short on information the south east coast of england had of the towers covering coastline of maybe miles this would put them an average of miles apart im assuming that the artillery of the time would not be able to fire distance of miles and if they could it would be extremely inaccurate if were an invading navy would give the towers wide berth then would land my ships at point equidistant from towers where they would not be able to reach with their cannon then move inland within this narrow corridor leaving the towers until they surrendered or starved assume im not the greatest military mind in history so what am missing
53588 on the 21st april hitler ordered the armeeabteilung steiner and the ninth army to execute counter attack on the approaching soviet forces how and why did hitler become deluded enough to give such an order can understand that capitulation was no option for him however he could have allowed his troops to retreat or hold their positions or even to surrender discretely without having to concede to the allied forces why however did he deliberately order counter attack that had it been carried out would doubtlessly have cost the lives of many soldiers in situation that was so obviously settled note an obvious answer would be that hitler was fanatical lunatic this would also explain all too easily the volkssturm and much else not only do not believe in that disregard such reflections as unhistoric since there cant be reliable analysis of his psyche especially in the very last phase of the war instead im looking for rational motives from military standpoint
53617 heres where am starting from aleutians battle of dutch harbor june smaller aircraft carriers main midway battle june big carriers with smaller that werent right there us puts carriers leaving alone why the carriers got split into and at midway why didnt the japanese concentrate all their forces now in wars concentration of forces is generally considered good thing but there are valid reasons for splitting up an attacking force diversion to lure defenders elsewhere simultaneous attack to force the defenders to split up their forces and finally increased opportunity for flanking the enemy when your forces are not too widely separated the aleutians sideshow fit badly on all those counts coming so soon before midway the us navy wasnt going to send off its carriers there in time to strip them from midway and conversely being so far away each us force was acting independently anyway now midway is thought of as great us victory and it was but it might easily have been disaster the first attacking us torpedo planes had been entirely destroyed until the dive bombers arrived just when the zeros cap was occupied with the lower level torpedo bombers and the japanese still managed to sink carrier at this time of the war the zero was still dominant against wildcats and buffalos and they still had their very best pilots around having the smaller alaska carriers could easily have made difference especially as big part of carrier engagements was finding the enemy carriers even relatively small attack wave could get lucky and put carrier out of action did watch youtube about the coral sea battle and yes it seems that japanese navy loved complex plans with lots of different forces and yes what might seem natural to westerners raised on clausewitz and napoleon pushing for decisive battle with all your forces may not be as appealing to japanese especially if someone like sun tzu was an influence but still utterly fail to understand why the aleutians couldnt wait until after midway was that somehow related to japans shortage of ship fuel that they wouldnt have been able to do both edit ive added why diversion to alaska on the 4th would be not help and in fact would be disadvantageous to the japanese if the usn went for it should have mentioned the cracked codes but they are not factor in how yamamoto reasons about alaska as diversion even if they screw up anything yamamoto does decide to do think of this as game of poker yamamoto does not know the us sees part of his hand he cant know the usn will never fall for an alaska diversion but he can apply logic to calculate what the effect of the us taking the bait would be lets say he wants to get some part of the us fleet underway towards alaska so that he has more time to invade midway without interference from the us navy if it is diversion the whole point is that the usn needs to be spun up prepped for depature and then head out km away to alaska whats that gonna take hrs hrs if it takes the usn hrs to be ready to sail then after alaska on the 4th they are ready to sail on the 5th just as the ijn is striking midway essentially yamamoto is giving the usn hour response time would you as japanese planner assume that your enemy would be able to ship in less than hrs on this level of deployment capital ships on 3700k 5days trip thats going to take them to combat area where there may be no us fuel stations left by the time they get there assuming they launch at all its very risky sounding deployment for uncertain upsides because thats the good reason for doing this assumption for june 4th alaska strike if it is meant as diversion the royal navy as far as understand when they heard the germans were out took hrs to leave scapa flow their base on the way to nearby jutland bbc jutland timeline but the rn is probably not what the usn is at this stage much less what the ijn thinks the usn is capable of doing then once the usn is heading out since you want to gain time you need to have them sail further away if they were going the opposite way say degrees towards panama california then youd pretty much win day for each day they went out but pocketearth one of my favorite apps on ios one have no affiliation with says 3500k to dutch harbor 1960k to midway so the usn is getting closer to midway as it heads out for at the very least days then past that it takes an extra days till theyre actually further from midway to help than without that diversion all this from whenever they leave pearl harbor google maps now take away alaska is diversion and replace and the boss says to do alaska them us navy guys are pushovers anyway same time so theyll be sleeping again or whatever other reason just the diversion idea on the 4th makes no sense and these pre computer guys are very smart with numbers the cracked codes make it lot easier for the us navy to win but the victory is not foregone conclusion look at the actual battle the level of courage and sacrifice by sailors and pilots of both the ijn and usn is tremendous but lot of it boils down to luck and those carriers could have helped the japanese quite bit
53649 know that some villages were the sole and only property of certain minor lords or knights such villages surely had manor or even castle where the lord lives on the other hand many lords had multiple villages under their fiefs such lords would have their castle in the most important village probably would be town so what about their other villages did the lord give each of them to one of their knights and so those knight would build their manors in them or did they simply leave them under their direct control and thus they would have no manor in them if this is the case then how did lords collected taxes protected guard and rule these remote villages
53694 before henry of england resumed the hundred years war against france he and the french government acting for charles vi who was mentally ill were negotiating for peace treaty where henry would abandon his claims to the french throne according futurelearn com this is what henry offered english demands included marriage between henry and one of the daughters of charles vi as well as the restitution of the terms of the treaty of br tigny of whereby edward iii had been conceded extensive lands in south western france in return for renouncing his claim to the french throne but the negotiations came to nought and henry announced his intention in parliament of november to launch an invasion although he was persuaded to send another embassy the french remained intransigent especially after further reconciliation between armagnacs and burgundians however that is contradicted by the wikipedia article on the siege of harfleur he claimed the title of king of france through his great grandfather edward iii although in practice the english kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the french would acknowledge the english claim on aquitaine and other french lands the terms of the treaty of bretigny he initially called great council in the spring of to discuss going to war with france but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims in the following negotiations henry said that he would give up his claim to the french throne if the french would pay the million crowns outstanding from the ransom of john ii who had been captured at the battle of poitiers in and concede english ownership of the lands of normandy touraine anjou brittany and flanders as well as aquitaine henry would marry princess catherine the young daughter of charles vi and receive dowry of million crowns the french responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with princess catherine dowry of crowns and an enlarged aquitaine by negotiations had ground to halt with the english claiming that the french had mocked their claims and ridiculed henry himself in december the english parliament was persuaded to grant henry double subsidy tax at twice the traditional rate to recover his inheritance from the french on april henry again asked the great council to sanction war with france and this time they agreed which is correct what did england and france offer did either side offer the terms of the treaty of br tigny

53867 will be teaching middle school world history this year surveyed seven different textbooks from different publishers and notice unlike all other histories of other regions in the world chinese history is covered in two different parts of the books chapter chinese ancient times to the han dynasty chapter ancient greece classical greece roman republic roman empire various islamic kingdoms and various african empires chapter sui tang song yuan ming and qing dynasties remaining chapters medieval europe since this split appears in all of the textbooks there must be some significance for splitting the history there what is the likely logic behind dividing chinese history at the han dynasty
53883 we all know how the axis offensive in led to the turning point battle of stalingrad and the eventual defeat of the third reich and that this offensive had been launched in order to capture and hold the caucasus the last bit is important merely capturing the caucasus was not the aim of operation blau but the acquisition of its resources primarily oil these resources would require infrastructure logistics and long term extraction the entire region once held would have to have been secured against any potential offensives by the red army how did the german high command hope to accomplish this the axis offensive was always going to create massive salient with relatively narrow corridor of axis control for both industrial and military transportation the southern border of the caucasus has natural defensive boundary but dont believe that anything other than the volga could act as potential barrier was there any plans for how to defend such large area

53947 before getting into this note that am not saying this would have been good idea nor am advocating this as being correct approach not at all it would surely have been horrific and very hard to justify and likely counterproductive in many ways but im asking this from military point of view in the interest of winning at war it seems the north would never abandon their goal to unite the country under communist rule so the only way could see to win to prevent the north from succeeding would be to simply annihilate them otherwise you could stay there forever and not change thing it seems odd to be losing war and yet not use your biggest weapon to turn the tide to continue to lose troops and territory yet restrain your military did they not do it because they just didnt want to kill that many civilians were they afraid the soviets and chinese would retaliate in kind

54050 the 4th bullet here contends gen joubert viewed the aftermath of the battle and noted that the british rifles were sighted at yards when the battle raged at about yards as the british officers had not told the troops to alter their weapons and as result they were shooting downhill over the heads of the enemy who had scant shelter why would british officers dictate range and so micromanage the enlisted why not simply dictate broader vaguer command such as adjust or check your sights

54121 countless sources claim that the origin of the term terra nullius is from papal bull issued by pope urban ii in called terra nullius here are two pramod nayar the postcolonial studies dictionary terra nullius comes from the papal bull terra nullius issued by pope urban ii at the beginning of the crusades reed underwood terra nullius the spectral colonialism of no man sky in pope urban ii issued bull inaugurating the doctrine of terra nullius which declared that lands occupied by non christians could be legally interpreted as unoccupied and then claimed by christians the doctrine became the legal underpinning for the conquest of muslim territories during the first crusade the same claim is made in lots of google books pages but they are so hard to copy paste from my question is if this claim is correct if it is can someone please link to and cite relevant sections from this papal bull havent been able to find it myself
54127 does it have something to do with the us taking part in aiding reconstruction of the country after wwii ive tried googling around for an answer but every site find simply states the outlet style as well as voltage and frequency as opposed to explaining why the outlet type is shared just to be clear am asking what lead to the japanese choosing to use type plugs sockets the spirit of the question is what is the historical reason why if buy device in japan it can clearly and easily plug into us socket and vice versa im not asking about voltages im not asking about ac dc or current im aware those things are different im simply asking about the physical socket
54160 what mean by this is has there ever been country where the bulk of the population spoke two different languages as matter of course this question is somewhat inspired by this video in which simone giertz says that everyone in sweden learns english from when they are eight to my american ears she speaks nearly flawless unaccented english to the point where dont as native speaker think id even realize she was not one as well it also brought to mind scene in the norwegian film trollhunter in which some norwegians run into some polish plumbers the subitled conversation is confused at first then both parties switch to english to understand each other again the norwegians speak english with only mild accent this has also been my experience professionally working for company that has high swedish representation due to past mergers now obviously theres some bias as to who would be working in the us but again often dont even realize someone is swedish until they start using the language this is in contrast to many other foreign born people work with where even when their english is quite good theres still clear accent ive been told by couple of swedish coworkers that well everyone in sweden knows english also have some belgian colleagues and the situation there is similar so it seems that in that area of the world theres situation where one native language is used internally while another language is used to talk to people outside the country it got me to wondering if this is sustainable thing if we go one hundred years in the future will scandinavia have become an english speaking territory or will languages like swedish norwegian etc persist in other words is what we see today in scandinavia transient situation on the road to english dominance or move to something different with native languages and common tongue so was curious about historical precedents now know that this has not been unusual for the elites for instance in roman times most literate romans spoke greek and in many periods in europe the elites would speak french to each other rather than their native tongue but im more interested in the bulk of the population have there been periods before the modern era where the bulk of the population in some region would know two languages at near fluency for this purpose we can define before modern era as before world war ii
54175 on questionable website full of revisionist pro nazi propaganda which is not worth linking to found the following statement along the same lines remember national socialist bookseller that used what it called aryan pricing rather than or please dont ask me what was doing there if you really want to find the quoted site just put the quote in your favourite search engine find the concept very interesting according to that other question those psychological pricing ending in were already around since the end of the xixth century which find shocking as always believed this was modern idea so such prices could have been seen in pre nazi germany and can totally see how people were annoyed at the sellers trying to rip them off with those prices and be relieved that this annoying practice end once the ns regime is in place this would increase the confidence of the regime which would be perceived as less corrupt unfortunately cannot find any other reference about that than this revisionist site so is there any verified truth about this statement edit about the sign in the quote it could have been used as general symbol meaning money in an english language text and does not necessarily refer to the usd currency which obviously was irrelevant in nazi germany but the implication seems to be as the seller seems at least to refer to his ideology originating from nazi germany the question is still whether this was thing for national socialist then to not like psychological pricing and call round prices aryan pricing declaring that the aryan and thus preferred behaviour for sellers and whether this then found its way into actual german law when the nazis were legislating outright forbidding such pricing strategies
54198 from alexander the great to saladin from muqali to horatio nelson from napoleon to winfield scott history is loaded with great male generals have there been any great female generals warfare certainly relies heavily on physical strength making it male dominated discipline but commanding doesnt seem to be physically intensive which should superficially make female generals just as effective as male ones the closest can think of is catherine ii of russia aka catherine the great who was sovereign of the nation and so technically the commander in chief however as far as know she did not personally command troops in battles edit to clarify im looking for those who commanded armies in the field multiple times and won much more often than they lost am not interested in those who fought but did not command such as hua mulan commanded only once albia dominica or did not win cleophis
54217 my question is not about an alternative scenario nor about the reasons that caused switzerland to not get invaded as could be seen here why was switzerland not attacked during the two world wars am asking about if the swiss military of ww2 is clearly overrated many people claim that the country was and still is impossible to invade due to the mountains and the guns owned by swiss citizens but there are many examples of similar situations that happened in history as exposed in the question below that show very clearly that those reasons are not sufficient to exclude an invasion and occupation often people make the claim that given the mountainous terrain of switzerland an invasion would have been close to impossible however the germans successfully invaded norway yugoslavia and greece all of which also have mountainous terrain also switzerland is much closer to germany than greece and norway so bringing new troops and supply would have been quicker and easier for the same reason it is generally said that in case of invasion the swiss army would have retreated into the mountain strongholds leaving much of the population and economical industrial centers to the invader this is the so called national redoubt strategy however why would the german and italian armies need to attack those strongholds in the mountains why could they not simply occupy the swiss plateau then wait and let the swiss soldiers starve to death in their mountain fortresses feeding soldiers in the alps for months if not years isnt realistic plus their ammunition stocks would be limited while the axis could bring as much supplies as they want to then there is the argument that given the vast majority of swiss men who own guns at home even in case of german victory there would be guerrilla warfare however if am correct the german army knew quite well how to deal efficiently with rebels in its occupied territories they could simply retaliate on the village or region thus causing the rebels to think twice before deciding to do something and anyway wouldnt this guerrilla warfare calm down after few years when people become accustomed to german and italian rules in case of invasion the axis would benefit from the surprise effect given that they would be the one attacking first that means that at least the border cities of geneva and basel would have fallen quickly then that also means that the swiss army would not be able to destroy all the roads railways and other means of communications before retreating from regions close to the borders thus the german army would potentially advance relatively quickly in the first few hours that also means that parachutists could be dropped behind swiss lines to secure important positions like strategic areas in the jura mountains to prevent the swiss from using them as defensive line given the close proximity to the border with occupied france wouldnt the german army then be able to quickly secure the jura mountains thus having free room for an invasion of the plateau fourth and most importantly the blitzkrieg tactic could still be used in the plateau that means that especially in the first hours of the invasion the german luftwaffe could simply bomb each and every swiss military position on the plateau which would then allow for its conquest and then as said one could just wait for the swiss army to starve in their mountains and finally surrender or die there are probably more reasons but those are the main ones that found was switzerland much easier to conquer than imagined

54254 coworker from another country asked me today if it is true that we have law prohibiting any building in place from being taller than their church told him dont know if we still have any such law and if we had most likely would know about it so he asked how come no german city has taller buildings than their church this question is now haunting me can barely think of any city or village ever was in with maybe or exceptions here in germany where the church wasnt the highest building maybe there once was such law but if it isnt in force how did it come to be that there are rarely any modern buildings taller than the church towers or is this just subjective and in fact there are lot of german cities with taller buildings then their churches
54273 fear this question may be rather broad and would like help to narrow it down currently debate is ongoing in greece regarding the law preventing police from stepping into university campuses the law was put in place after the fall of the military junta in which had violently suppressed student rebellion such protection was meant to safeguard students and freedom of speech was reading the new york times article and the following claim was made at the end odysseas zoras the top official of the university of crete said both academics and society were ready for an end to an antiquated concept introduced in bologna in the 11th century to avert the church intervention in academia however have been unable to find sources related to this claim the wikipedia page on the university of bologna as well as the history page of the actual university dont mention anything in this regard additionally note that many us universities have their own police forces which this article links with the 1960s protests therefore what would like to ask is this is there confirmation of an asylum law in place in the university of bologna and what was its scope were there other instances throughout the history of universities were similar laws were put in place and if yes when why were they abolished why do universities prefer to have their own police force

54350 hitlers views on slavs were unambiguous he considered them to be untermensch and wanted them exterminated so that germans could take their place for more on hitlers hostility to the slavs see this askhistorians answer of course realpolitik forced nazi germany to make alliances with some slavic groups just like there was cooperation between nazi germany and jewish groups put cooperation in quotes so that you please wont argue this my point is only that realpolitik and ideology was not always the same for nazi germany modern neo nazis however seem to disagree especially northern european neo nazis appear to have quite favorable views of slavs cooperation between nordic or german and eastern european neo nazis is common western and eastern european neo nazis treat each other as brothers in arms behavior hitler most certainly would have objected to my question is thus why neo nazi views regarding slavs have changed and when has there been any debate in any nazi movement about this issue langlangc if you consider the neo nazis as the ideological descendants of nazi germany which do then think the evidence indicates that their views have changed but cant find any sources at all neither from within the neo nazi movement or from the outside thank you for your praise italian philosopher the question of why many slavs are neo nazis are also very interesting but for now im only interested in why non slavic neo nazis are so accepting of the slavs
54365 most villeins were bound to the manor and not allowed to move elsewhere but what happened when the population grew the size of the manor remained the same didnt it so how did they keep up with the increased food requirement for all the people as more people get born new houses needed to get built and the village grew or perhaps separate village was built on the manor but there would have to be need for more and more fields to grow food on and more animals and pastures so how did they solve this problem was overpopulation big problem during the middle ages at least before the black death
54377 im having trouble finding particular historical reference in on manly courage study of platos laches on page the author implies that spartan common meals were followed by the recounting of noble deeds lysimachus and melesias are raising their sons in the bracing military discipline of the spartan syssitia common meals and evenings after dinner they tell the boys tales of their ancestors noble deeds kala erga in war and peace while he doesnt outright say it in context it seems fairly clear that he means that recounting deeds after meals itself emulates spartan practice if this is the case id like to confirm it with primary source if not id like to confirm otherwise from someone more familiar with spartan history wikipedia seems to confirm the point at least for crete if not sparta saying meals were followed by conversation which was first directed to the public affairs of the state and afterwards turned on valiant deeds in war and the exploits of illustrious men whose praises might animate the younger hearers to an honourable emulation but it does not cite clear source for that plutarch in his life of lycurgus says they used to send their children to these tables as to schools of temperance aristotle makes several references to common meals in politics but word search did not turn up what was looking for also looked at book four of athenaeus which is referenced on the above wiki page but the lacedaemonian section didnt have the answer is there primary source that confirms spartan or reasonably comparable cretan common meals were followed by the recounting of public affairs and noble deeds edit as sempaiscuba rightly pointed out the wikipedia article is quoting athenaeus after all found here id just gone little cross eyed and went off looking in the wrong place but this still refers to crete of course as stated above that works just fine for my purposes and it may very well be the passage the laches commentary is obliquely referencing but ill leave the question open for another day or two in case anyone has an answer for sparta in particular
54385 in the stanley kubrick movie full metal jacket soldier being interviewed tells the reporter that his platoons job is to pave the way for the tanks because the army doesnt want its tanks to run over mines or get blown up by shoulder fired rockets this of course would be an absurd policy to use frail human soldiers to protect armored vehicles youd think it would be the other way around was this plot device by the filmmaker to further illustrate the absurdity of that war or did this actually happen
54415 recently have read in the news about large hoard of norman coins in england being found apparently all of these coins were silver pennies and then it occurred to me that small silver coins were the only coins minted in western europe for centuries ad 700s to 1200s how would large payments be commonly made back then did people use medley of ancient and foreign gold coins or bags and bags of silver pennies and why did it take so long to mint higher value silver coins like shilling would expect any king would want to mint high value coins even if gold is scarce
54471 the russian wikipedia page states that an art from michelangelo is source of inspiration for rosie the riveter arrwork my own impression is this looks indeed like that there are many similarities but is this somehow proven by any historical facts sources
54533 the second law of the code of hammurabi states if any one bring an accusation against man and the accused go to the river and leap into the river if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house but if the river prove that the accused is not guilty and he escape unhurt then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser why was jumping into the river valid way to solve dispute was it specific river being mesopotamia surely brings two specific rivers to mind
54546 im interested in countries that voted themselves out of existence because they believe that joining another country is best for them see world government for example say new zealand votes to join australia becoming australias seventh state if australia accepts then the country of new zealand has effectively voted itself out of existence im wondering if this has happened before the closest cases im aware of are the dominion of newfoundland due to newfoundlands high debt load arising from world war and construction of the newfoundland railway and decreasing revenue due to the collapse of fish prices the dominion legislature voted itself out of existence in in exchange for loan guarantees by the crown and promise it would be re established on february the commission of government was sworn in ending years of responsible government however this doesnt seem like very good example because newfoundland wasnt sovereign country and if the description is correct theyre not uniting with the crown they just wanted more money and they also received promise that theyll be re established another case is singapore which became independent against its will in the then malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from malaysia on august the malaysian parliament voted to with singaporean delegates not present to move bill to amend the constitution providing for singapore to separate from the federation of malaysia this gave singapore independence unusually against its own will this implies that if there was vote then about whether singapore should join malaysia the country would vote yes however since malaysia was not willing to accept it doesnt match what im looking for either finally there is the scottish independence referendum of but again that does not work because scotland isnt sovereign country
54568 according to civil engineer video in spanish the appian way was built as concession this is it was built by private company paid by the state unfortunately wikipedia is not clear about who built the appian way it only states who commissioned it more generally regarding public roman roads financing road building was roman government responsibility maintenance however was generally left to the province the officials tasked with fund raising were the curatores viarum they had number of methods available to them private citizens with an interest in the road could be asked to contribute to its repair high officials might distribute largesse to be used for roads censors who were in charge of public morals and public works were expected to fund repairs su pecuni with their own money beyond those means taxes were required and roman roads were named after the censor who had ordered their construction or reconstruction all this however doesnt state who built the roads any expert on the topic

54678 thousands of people tried to find their fortune in the california gold rush though its often reported that the people who became wealthy from this event were the ones that were selling supplies to the miners and not the miners themselves dont know how accurate source it is but read an article on sparticus educational com about the california gold rush it mentioned that only minority of miners made much money but did not give any details on who they might have been though it does go into more detail on some of the suppliers who made lot of money such as sam brannan and josiah belden are there any examples of miners and prospectors and not suppliers who became wealthy due to the california gold rush
54807 background to my current understanding james matheson in his the british trade with china argued that china might have originally had the right to refuse trading with britain but that they lost such right by consenting even tacitly to the opium trade one passage that interpret in the above sense reads without discussing the question whether the chinese are absolutely warranted in justice to their fellow nations in shutting out all the rest of the world from any participation in the benefits of so prodigious portion of the most desirable parts of the earth even when that participation would be attended with corresponding advantages to themselves it may be contended that china has long since surrendered such rights and is no longer in position to enforce them as against the british nation that her conduct during the last century or two has amounted not merely to simple permission to us to carry on our trade with her but has conferred upon us perfect rights such as are accompanied by the right of compelling the fulfilment of the corresponding obligations thence stems my question question were there no instances before the mid 19th century opium wars of national state legally banning harmful imports were the above arguments more than facetious excuses by the legal standards of the time hadn britain empire in particular ever banned from import any product that they thought harmful and dangerous and no longer to be tolerated let not go back to the time before the advent of nations edit very rightly the term national state has been criticised unfortunately am unsure how to better phrase this my point is that matheson as far as understand from my first reading heavily draws upon vattel the law of nations for defending the supposed british rights seek examples of states that have accepted the law of nations but enacted similar trade bans as the qing did
54838 some sources distinguish between mythology and legends for the purpose of this question im asking about narrations about human beings for example stories of everyday human beings genealogies of kings etc what is the role of and legend as historical sources there are lists of kings and genealogies of the past in mythological works although not supported by rigorous documentation they offer glimpse of some of the powerful rulers present at that time or the names which are collected by the author for example author shri veda vyasa mentions various kings names of their kingdoms and geographical locations etc in the epic mahabharata which is considered as itihasa or history even if there is insufficient supporting evidence to conclude that the lists are accurate is it possible to form and test inferences based on these legends can they be treated similar to oral histories and other non textual sources am interested to find out that to what extend such listings of kings or rulers are considered valid and correct in order to ascertain history of particular region not only of india but in general by historians do historians consider them as authentic
54956 in defending his decision to withdraw from northern syria and cease supporting kurdish fighters in the face of the turkish invasion donald trump said the kurds didn help us in the second world war they didn help us with normandy as an example what exactly is trump talking about in what way were kurds involved or not involved in the invasion of normandy was there sizable kurdish population in france or kurdish contingent of the allied powers which refused to support the operation or something else
54976 from what ive gathered at glance aborigine australians have about years of history on their continent roughly equivalent to that of people on other continents yet from what can gather aborigine civilizations had less advanced technology than their old world counterparts while jared diamond argues that agriculture was not as easily possible cursory wikipedia search at agriculture in australia suggests that the temperate and subtropical climate areas are plentiful in the country im not much of geography expert but if were to apply the concept of hot dry climate then the arab world comes to mind and the arab world had plenty of ancient civilizations that were able to develop agriculture were there any other sources of troubles for aborigines that prevented their discovering other technologies isolation mightve certainly been factor but even then if we were to take ancient japan civilization developed at more rapid pace there even before seafaring was discovered
54990 boris johnson in his book the churchill factor how one man made history writes the only man to come through it with colours flying was churchill parliamentary aide bob boothby mp who famously replied to hitler megalomaniacal greeting of heil hitler with the only logical response heil boothby said boothby and he sources the information from robert rhodes james book robert boothby portrait of churchill ally london to which have no access the phrasing suggests that hitler was exclaiming heil hitler himself when meeting with others is this true are there sources or documents which confirm hitler using this exclamation

55213 re posting this question of mine from the worldbuilding stack exchange know its common for shops and stores to be named in and other fantasy settings but how common was that practice in the medieval era say from ad onward it seems to me that inns and the like were named more often than say the workshops of smiths traders or other craftsmen and merchants im trying to be as realistic as possible with the campaign world im establishing so if theres historical precedent ill feel better about it edit its also been brought to my attention to clarify whether or not mean this in general or specific sense the answer is the former if the convention wasnt really present in asian or middle easter countries for example but was in european ones that information still helps immensely im just hoping to find out how popular the practice was in the medieval era
55283 have recently read about two ancient battles that were won by much smaller army and or lead to very different casualties defeat of boudica according to roman accounts only romans died as opposed to of boudicas forces thus resulting in casualties ratio however the figure is considered unrealistic battle of alesia casualties were about romans and from gallic confederation resulting in casualties ratio are these the most efficient battles in the history am interested in significant battles there were fought between at least soldiers
